{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in recent years and are now essential to various applications in natural language processing (NLP). These LLMs are typically pre-trained on large natural language datasets and then fine-tuned on specific datasets for various tasks. Recent studies indicate that LLMs are successful because they operate as knowledge bases, storing learned information in their parameters and generating responses by accessing this internal memory. To enhance generation performance by incorporating more knowledge, existing approaches often increase memory capacity by expanding the number of parameters. Although current LLMs are powerful, they encounter several challenges that hinder their development. One significant challenge is the hallucination problem, where LLMs generate responses that are coherent and fluent but factually incorrect. Another major challenge is the efficient updating of the models' internal knowledge. To update the knowledge stored in the internal memory of LLMs, it is necessary to retrain or fine-tune them with new data, which is costly. A challenge faced by general LLMs is their limited domain-specific knowledge. Developing a domain-specific LLM requires extensive effort in compiling suitable datasets. To address these challenges, recent methods propose using an external knowledge database to improve LLMs, a technique referred to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Providing LLMs with accurate factual information from external sources can help mitigate the hallucination problem. Additionally, issues with knowledge updates can be resolved by refreshing the external knowledge database, enabling LLMs to access up-to-date information. RAG can transform a general LLM into a domain-specific one by creating and utilizing a specialized knowledge database. RAG significantly enhances the capabilities of LLMs, making them more precise, knowledgeable, and reliable across various applications. This paper reviews all techniques related to RAG in the field of natural language processing. Despite the existence of numerous survey papers on RAG, our survey provides new insights. The paper systematically outlines each component of RAG, from retriever construction to querying, and includes techniques for retrieval fusion along with tutorial codes. This paper presents various RAG training strategies, whether or not they involve updating the datastore. The paper also examines RAG's applications in different NLP tasks and real-world scenarios. Finally, it identifies promising future research directions and key challenges to address. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of RAG. Sections 3 and 4 thoroughly explore the technical aspects involved in retrievers and retrieval fusion techniques. Section 6 explains how to train RAG, with or without incorporating new knowledge. Section 7 outlines the techniques applied in major NLP tasks. Section 8 delves into RAG's applications in real-world NLP scenarios. Section 9 investigates future directions for RAG.

To enhance their ability to store knowledge, researchers often expand memory capacity by increasing parameter volume.\n\nDespite their power, several challenges hinder the further development of these models. One major issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate responses that are fluent but inaccurate. Another challenge is the difficulty of updating the knowledge stored within the internal memory of these models. Updating requires retraining or fine-tuning with new data, which is an expensive process. Additionally, these models often lack domain-specific expertise, which requires significant effort in data collection for training specialized models.\n\nRecent advancements propose using external knowledge databases to augment these models, a technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By providing models with relevant factual information from external sources, the hallucination problem can be mitigated. The issue of updating knowledge can be addressed by refreshing the external database, allowing models to access the latest information.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results (Brown et al., 2020) in generating coherent text and code in zero and few-shot settings. This is especially true for resource-rich languages. However, their practical utility depends on their ability to follow instructions or constraints at various granularity. This encompasses user and system requirements. Recent studies (Sun et al., 2023) indicate that LLMs struggle with fine-grained constraints in natural language prompts. This is especially evident in paraphrase generation and numerical planning tasks. While previous work studied the controllability of language models (LMs) using fine-grained instructions in natural language (NL) format, the necessity to represent instructions in code format arises from a critical enterprise use case involving system-level programming. Listing 1: The JSON sample generated (highlighted in yellow) by the Granite 20B model does not adhere to the minContains constraint. It also does not follow subsequent numerical constraints. Write a JSON sample with field values as per the JSON format schema given below. { \"type\": \"array\", \"contains\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"multipleOf\": 2.66, \"exclusiveMinimum\": 0.08231885995435284, \"exclusiveMaximum\": 5.1100233535478 }, \"minContains\": 7 } JSON sample: [2.66, 5.22, 8.88, 12.54, 16.2, 19.86, 23.52, 27.18]. System-level code integrity is maintained through use-case-specific constraints. These constraints are typically encoded using schemas. Schemas are instructions in structured code languages like JSON, YAML, XML, or Python to enforce constraints like data types and required fields, ensuring code integrity. For example, the schema in Listing 1 requires the sample to be an array of numbers. Each number must be a multiple of 2.66 and fall within the range defined by the exclusiveMinimum and exclusiveMaximum fields. Additionally, the array must contain at least seven elements. Following such schema constraints, developers write system-level code in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in a format similar to JSON, YAML, or XML. DSLs are custom languages with specialized schemas and syntax suitable for a particular domain or application. These DSLs are common for tasks like data exchange and system configuration, such as in Kubernetes. Writing DSL code requires deep domain expertise and a significant learning process for developers. This has led to a growing adoption of LLMs for system-level programming in several products. The first two products include Ansible Lightspeed3. Given the cruciality of factoring in schemas with LLMs, there is increasing interest in using constrained decoding for DSLs (Pimparkhede et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a).

The second task is DSL validation: validate code against constraints.

There is a French consonant that looks like an English letter but makes a completely different sound: the French j, which sounds like the s in the English word 'measure,' as in the French words 'jaune,' 'jouer,' 'journal,' 'jamais,' 'jupe,' and 'jardin.' The French q or qu always sounds like the k in the English word 'kit,' as in the words 'quand,' 'qualit\u00e9,' 'quatre,' 'question,' 'quinze,' and 'quiche.' Several French consonants have different pronunciations depending on the vowel that follows them or their position in a word; for instance, the letter c sounds like an s before an e or i, as in 'cent,' 'cin\u00e9ma,' 'c\u00e9cile,' and 'cit\u00e9,' but it sounds like a k in other cases, as in 'car,' 'cousin,' 'coq,' and 'cuisine.' However, there are also some French words in which the c sounds like an s even when it isn't followed by an e or an i, such as in 'fa\u00e7ade,' 're\u00e7u,' '\u00e7a,' 'fran\u00e7ais,' and 'gar\u00e7on.' When a g comes before an e or an i, it sounds like the s in the English word 'measure,' as in 'g\u00e9n\u00e9ral' and 'girafe.' Elsewhere, it makes a hard g sound like the g in the English word 'go,' as in 'gar\u00e7on' and 'guide.' The French s sounds the same as the English s at the beginning of a word, as in 'soleil,' 'soupe,' 'serpent,' and 'sable.' However, when it is between two vowels, it sounds like the English z, as in 'maison,' 'rose,' 'd\u00e9sert,' and 'oiseau.' The French r is spoken from the back of your throat, similar to the sound you make when gargling, as heard in words like 'rue,' 'rare,' 'rouge,' and 'r\u00e9ponse.' The French r has no equivalent sound in English, making it difficult for English speakers to master and requiring practice to produce correctly. In French, the letter h is never pronounced with a hard h sound, as in English, even if a word starts with an h, such as in 'h\u00f4tel,' 'heure,' 'hiver,' 'honneur,' 'h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re,' and 'histoire.' The consonant blend ch is most commonly pronounced like an sh, as in 'chapeau,' 'chaud,' 'chocolat,' and 'chaise.' In a few loanwords from other languages, ch is pronounced like a k, as in 'chorale' and 'architecte,' but it is never pronounced like the ch in the English word 'chatter.'

However, if the following word starts with a vowel, they will be pronounced as usual. Two French consonants resemble English letters but produce different sounds. If English is your first language, these may initially confuse you. You'll master them with practice. The French j sounds like the s in the English word \"measure.\" The French q or qu always sounds like the k in \"kit.\" Several French consonants have different pronunciations depending on the following vowel or their position in a word. Many of these are similar to \"hard\" and \"soft\" consonants in English. When it comes before an e or an i, the letter c sounds like an s, similar to the \"soft c\" in the word \"menace.\" Otherwise, the letter c sounds like a k. However, some French words have a c that sounds like an s even if it's not followed by an e or an i. For these, an accent mark is added, resulting in \u00e7 as in the word \u00e7a (pronounced sah, meaning \"that\"). When a g comes before an e or an i, it sounds like the s in \"measure.\" Elsewhere, it makes a hard g sound like in \"go.\" The French s sounds the same as the English s at the beginning of a word. However, whenever it is between two vowels, it sounds like the English z. The French r is spoken from the back of your throat, similar to the sound you make when gargling. You make the sound by pressing the back of your tongue against your throat as you push air around it. To practice, try gargling a liquid in your upper throat and making a sound at the same time. When you can do this consistently, try the same thing again, but with no liquid. The French r has no equivalent sound in English, so it can be difficult. However, if you simply pronounce it the same as an English r, you won't be able to pronounce French words correctly. In French, the letter h is never pronounced with a hard h sound, as in English. This is true no matter where the letter is in the word. Even if a word starts with an h, it still isn't pronounced. For example, the word hiver (winter) is pronounced ee-vair. The consonant blend ch is most commonly pronounced like sh. In a few loanwords from other languages, it is pronounced like a k, but never like the ch in \"chatter.\" These consonants are aspirated in English, which means you blow a puff of air out of your mouth when pronouncing them. However, in French, these consonants are typically not aspirated. French speakers occasionally aspirate these consonants, but only if they are angry or upset.

Avoid using plastic or sandpaper perches, which can be harmful to your bird.\n\nConcrete perches offer a solid place for birds to groom, and they should be positioned away from food, water, and toys. Natural branch perches are preferable to wooden dowels due to their uneven shape, which helps distribute pressure on different parts of the bird\u2019s feet. Select branches from orchard wood trees like apple, plum, or pear, but avoid cherry.

The task, commonly referred to as Split and Rephrase (SPRP) (Narayan et al., 2017), evaluates natural language processing models by requiring them to handle complex linguistic properties for optimal splits and rephrasing. SPRP is typically performed via transformation models, such as sequence-to-sequence modelling with a copy mechanism (Aharoni and Goldberg, 2018) or graph-based neural segmentation (Gao et al., 2021). A key limitation of this approach is the scarcity of training datasets with paired complex and split sentences across languages and domains. Alternatively, Kim et al. (2021) utilize one-to-many alignments in parallel corpora and pivot machine translation (MT) to create an aligned corpus, which can be used by sequence-to-sequence models. However, this method depends on parallel corpora with sufficient alignments and high-quality pivot MT models. Large language models (LLMs), such as the GPT models (Radford et al., 2018), have shown strong potential on numerous downstream tasks (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In this work, we evaluate their performance on the SPRP task by prompting the models to generate split and rephrase hypotheses from complex sentences. We assess different approach variants on datasets of varying complexity, examining zero-shot, few-shot in-context learning, and fine-tuning scenarios. We measure the impact of parameter and training data size, domain shift, and prompt optimization. Our results demonstrate that LLMs outperform previous state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics, with some remaining deficiencies, particularly in split generation. Two human evaluations, a comparative 3-way ranking task and a qualitative evaluation, support our findings. Our main contributions are: establishing new state-of-the-art on the SPRP task over multiple metrics and two human evaluations, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for SPRP, covering variants with and without instruction tuning, and empirical results showing LLM strengths and limitations for SPRP, particularly in splitting compliance and rephrasing variability.", "scores": {"ppl": 70.9160385131836, "some": 0.8924694061279297, "bart": -1.1694962978363037, "acc": 1.0}}}

It can be difficult dealing with underlying pain due to a difficult childhood or a difficult marriage where abuse patterns are prevalent. However, we can take control of our own lives by addressing our emotional difficulties, helping ourselves, and overcoming our addictions. Our thoughts tend to be linked to our feelings and behaviors. In order words, our perceptions of ourselves and the world dictate how we feel and act. These ideas are central to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This type of treatment is commonly used to treat self-destructive behaviors. Write down the thoughts that you associate with each of your self-destructive behaviors. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I think right before I do this? What thoughts influence and maintain this behavior?\u201d For example, if alcohol use is the problem, one might think, \u201cI'll just have one drink. I really need this drink. I deserve to drink. Nothing bad will happen.\u201d These are the thoughts that encourage a person to consume alcohol. Acknowledge your negative thinking habits. Some of these might include: catastrophizing (thinking the worst will happen), over-generalizing (also known as black and white thinking, where one tends to think something is either all good or all bad), mind-reading (thinking you know what others are thinking). Predicting the future (thinking you know what will happen) is another habit. For instance, if you believe that another person is thinking something bad about you, this could result in you feeling depressed or angry, which could trigger self-destructive behaviors. If you modify this thinking you can prevent the negative emotion and behavior. If we change our thoughts, our feelings and behaviors will follow. Once you have a complete list of the thoughts, you can begin to challenge these thoughts when they come up. Keep a thought diary. Identify the situation, feeling, and thought. Then identify ideas that support the thought, and ideas that do not support the thought. Finally, use this information to create a thought that is more realistic. For example, if the situation is your mother yelling at you, you might have felt angry. You might have thought, \u201cShe's the worst mother.\u201d Ideas that support this thought might be: she yells, and she doesn't know how to communicate calmly. Ideas that refute this idea might be: she tells me she loves me, she provides me with food and housing. She supports me, and so on. A more balanced perspective overall (in order to counteract the thought that she is the worst mother) could be, \u201cMy mother has her faults and she does yell sometimes. But I know that she is trying to help and that she loves me.\u201d This thought may lead to less anger, and thus, a healthier behavior (instead of drinking alcohol or socially isolating). Once you identify your unhelpful thinking, and develop alternative thoughts, you need to practice changing these thoughts as they come up. Be aware of any negative emotion you have (anger, sadness, stress), and identify the thoughts you are having in the moment. You can refer back to your thought diary to assist you. Then, actively change the thought you are having. If you are thinking, \u201cMy mother is terrible and doesn't love me,\u201d remember the alternative thought you identified before and repeat it to yourself over and over, \u201cMy mother loves me but she sometimes loses her temper.\" Log your progress and learn from mistakes. Continue to keep a diary of situations that could lead to self-destructive behaviors. If you identify negative thoughts, write down alternative thoughts that might produce a better outcome. If self-destructive behavior was used, identify an alternative. For example, if the situation was your mother yelling at you, you may have thought, \u201cI can't stand her. She doesn't care about me,\u201d followed by feelings of anger and resentment. This was followed by a behavior of locking yourself in your room and isolating from social contact for several days.

For instance, you could change the thought to, \"I love her despite her weaknesses, and I know she cares about me even when she acts this way.\" Try to think those thoughts the next time the situation occurs (your mother yells).

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Temporal constraints in conceptual data models are critically important in various application domains, including temporal conceptual data modeling, business process modeling, data analytics, and the design of append-only databases for blockchains, among others. A universal temporal conceptual data modeling language (TCDML) could significantly benefit these diverse application scenarios by reducing the learning curve and enhancing reuse. Existing TCDMLs often lack features such as transition constraints, temporal attributes, and relation migration, highlighting the need for user evaluations to assess preferences for diagram notation and understanding of temporal models. Including industry modellers, particularly C. Maria Keet, in this research is essential. Evaluating the fitness for purpose of temporal conceptual data models is crucial to ensure their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper aims to develop a TCDML grounded in the description logic language DLRUS, emphasizing the importance of graphical notation in facilitating user understanding and adoption. The resulting TCDML, named Trend, stands for Temporal information Representation in ENtity-relationship Diagrams, featuring innovative characteristics and benefits. We aimed to answer the following research questions: What diagram notation is preferred for temporal elements and constraints? How well is the resulting temporal conceptual model understood by modellers? How well are modellers able to design such models? To address these questions, we conducted three sets of experiments, using a clear experimental design to enhance the field of temporal conceptual data modeling. Identifying the most preferred notation for temporal information is important, and we used a qualitative reflective learning approach with industry participants and postgraduate students to achieve this. The second set of experiments focused on model understanding and feedback on minor notation variants, involving both postgraduate and undergraduate students. The third set of experiments examined the ability to design temporal conceptual models, varying explanations and tasks to ensure the findings are generalizable and statistically valid. Qualitative evaluations led to a tentative notation for Trend and highlighted the need for training on modeling temporal information, suggesting implications for improving user understanding and adoption. Quantitative experiments finalized and solidified the Trend notation, suggesting the benefits of a widely accepted standard. The experiments showed limited impact of labels on correctness but a clear preference for graphical notation over controlled natural language text. Best practices for using temporal entity types, attributes, and dynamic extensions were identified, underscoring their benefits and applications. Extensive introductory notes did not substantially aid overall modeling and understanding but did increase modeling of temporal attributes and relationships. Better domain demarcation using controlled natural language statements improved the modeling quality of temporal constraints. This paper extends our previously published work by introducing new experiments and large-scale evaluations that finalized the graphical notation of Trend, improving user understanding and adoption. The preliminary Trend was only sketched in previous work, but here we present the full language\u2014graphically, textually, and with its formal logic-based underpinning for precision and reference.

These range from temporal conceptual data modeling and business process modeling to data analytics and the design of append-only databases for blockchains, among others. Given this wide array of application scenarios, an ideal temporal conceptual data modeling language (TCDML) would be highly expressive. Such a language would facilitate diverse applications, ensuring that a single learning effort suffices across various scenarios, thereby promoting easy reuse.\n\nHowever, most existing TCDMLs are often found lacking in several aspects. They frequently miss out on incorporating transition constraints for object migration, temporal attributes, or relation migration (see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for examples). None of these languages have undergone evaluation by users concerning their preferences for diagram notation, particularly with temporal constraints, nor have they been assessed for their effectiveness in understanding a temporal model or creating a temporal conceptual data model. We include in this evaluation modelers from industry and both undergraduate and postgraduate students in academia, particularly those who have been taught conceptual modeling. Therefore, there is a fundamental need for an evaluation based on fitness for purpose.\n\nIn this paper, we endeavor to address this gap by developing a TCDML grounded in the description logic language DLRUS. Through a series of experiments, we designed and evaluated a graphical notation for this language. The resulting TCDML is termed Trend, which stands for Temporal information Representation in ENtity-relationship Diagrams. Our objective is to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Which diagram notation is preferred for temporal elements and constraints? RQ2: How well do modelers understand the resulting temporal conceptual model? RQ3: How proficient are modelers in designing such models?\n\nTo answer these questions, we conducted three sets of experiments. The first set involved a series of progressive experiments aimed at determining the 'best' or most preferred notation for temporal information among multiple notations. This was achieved through a qualitative reflective learning approach, with participants primarily from industry and a moderately-sized evaluation involving postgraduate students. The second set of experiments focused on understanding the model and obtaining feedback on several minor variants in notation for the transition constraint. This involved postgraduate students and a large group of undergraduate students. The third set of experiments concentrated on assessing the ability to design temporal conceptual models using the TCDML we developed. This involved varying the amount of explanation provided and the task to carry out. We executed three large-scale experiments with 200-450 participating students, who were relatively new to modeling, to ensure increased statistical validity of the conclusions.\n\nThe qualitative evaluations led to a 'tentative' notation for our TCDML, Trend, indicating a need for some training on modeling temporal information. The quantitative experiments helped finalize and solidify the Trend notation. The experiments revealed that labels for the transition constraints have minimal impact on correctness. However, a graphical notation is clearly preferred over controlled natural language text. Temporal entity types, attributes, and dynamic extension emerged as optimal for use. More comprehensive introductory notes did not significantly aid in modeling and understanding overall, although a notable improvement in modeling temporal attributes and relationships was observed. Better demarcation of the domain, provided through a set of controlled natural language statements, enhanced the modeling quality of the temporal constraints.\n\nThis paper extends our previously published work [6, 7] in several ways. While Trend was tested with a small number of participants in [7], we now summarize the experiments leading up to that version and conduct large-scale evaluations that also finalized the graphical notation. Further, the preliminary version of Trend was only sketched in [7], whereas here we present the complete language\u2014graphically, textually, and with its formal logic-based underpinning for precision and reference. Additionally, we offer a more comprehensive overview of related work.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of related work.

Instead, be proactive and say something like, \"I'm going out, but my homework is done, and I promise to be home by 9 p.m.\" If you've broken curfew before, rebuilding trust requires sticking to agreed times in the future.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns parents have is their child becoming physically intimate too soon. It's important to have open discussions with your parents about what's acceptable under their rules. Talk to them about boundaries like kissing, holding hands, and sex. Reassure them that you understand the importance of making responsible decisions. Avoid relying on TV, the internet, or friends for advice as these sources can be misleading or inaccurate.\n\nYou might say, \"I know you're worried about me getting physical, but I'm too young for that, and I find it gross. I just like this person and want to spend time with them.\" If you discuss physical boundaries and show agreement with their values, your parents may be more open to allowing you to date. It's not enough to talk about following the rules; you need to prove it through consistent actions.\n\nIf your parents worry that dating will interfere with your studies, have an in-depth conversation with them about setting limits. Stick to the limitations you set, like getting off the phone early or only going on one date a week. If your parents say, \"I don't want you dating because it'll take too much time from your studies,\" respond by saying, \"I have some free social time each week, and I'll make sure not to monopolize my time with this person. My responsibilities and school are my top priorities.\"\n\nStart by setting limits on how much you talk to or socialize with friends to prove you can manage your time. Discuss these boundaries with the person you're dating as well. Your parents may not like the idea of you being out late, which could be a reason they prevent you from dating. Instead of going out at night, ask if it's okay to go to the park or a museum during the day.\n\nDaytime dates are easier to plan on weekends when there's no school. Consider other daytime activities like visiting the mall, attending a matinee, hiking, or exploring a community garden. Public places not only provide fun but also ease parental concerns about intimacy. If your parents restrict dating because you'll be alone, reassure them by saying you'll be in a public place the whole time.\n\nIf your parents say, \"I don't want you alone with them,\" respond with, \"We'll be in a public place and won't have time to be alone unsupervised. I'm just trying to have fun, not be physical.\" Being alone with a date in a private space can raise concerns about intimacy. Consider public venues like music concerts, plays, or amusement parks for your outings. \n\nHanging out with a group of friends can feel less serious than an exclusive date. Yet, it still allows you to spend time with the person you like. Plan outings with friends to the movies, a restaurant, or the bowling alley. Going out with friends you've known for a while can make your parents more comfortable.\n\nAlthough explaining yourself to your parents might feel tedious or embarrassing, it's a worthwhile compromise. Once they start letting you go on dates, discuss limiting texting to maintain a focus on real-life interactions. You might say, \"I want to go on a date, but I promise to keep you informed so you know everything is okay.\" \n\nThe more you demonstrate responsibility during outings, the more trust you'll earn from your parents. Some parents worry about their child being in a car with an inexperienced driver. Others may doubt you're truthful about your destination, so they prevent you from riding with friends. A great solution is to have your parents drive you to and from the date.\n\nAllowing your parents to handle transportation can reassure them about your plans. If your parents can\u2019t drive, ask if another parent can take on the responsibility. By being open and considerate, you can balance dating with maintaining trust and respect with your parents.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.994556427001953, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.8842819929122925, "acc": 0.0}}}

Many years ago, a girl with an enchanting smile and a kind heart opened up to me, sharing secrets she had never told anyone else. She confided in me with an unwavering trust, feeling a bond stronger than with anyone else in her life, which filled me with a profound sense of gratitude and responsibility. I found myself completely captivated by her charming personality, entranced by her radiant smile and infectious laugh. I was deeply honored to spend time with her; it was an indescribable joy to me, and I hoped it resonated with her in the same way. When she told me she was moving across the country, I was heartbroken. I genuinely believed she would be in my life forever. This unexpected news shattered that belief, leaving me feeling lost because she had become an integral part of my world. She had been offered a prestigious position with a renowned organization that promised extensive travel, new adventures, and unparalleled professional growth, opportunities she couldn't possibly decline. The thought of never seeing her again was nearly unbearable, a heavy weight pressing on my heart. We kept in touch, but as I feared, our contact dwindled until it nearly disappeared, leaving a profound emptiness in my life. I continued with my life, meeting new people and forming new relationships, yet I always felt a void, an absence where her presence once was. I dated some wonderful people, but none truly compared to her enchanting presence, which always lingered vividly in my thoughts. She remained the gold standard in my mind, the benchmark against which I measured everyone I encountered.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Although pets are enchanting and steadfast companions that bring joy to any home, they can sometimes present challenges in their care. Every pet necessitates a considerable investment of time, financial resources, and emotional dedication. Additionally, each animal and breed comes with its own distinct and specific requirements. It is imperative to ensure that your desire for a pet is not fleeting but rather a commitment to long-term care. Most pets demand consistent daily attention and nurturing, so it's essential to allocate ample time at home to meet their needs. If you have children, consider which pets are suitable for kids, such as those known for their gentle and easy-going temperament. Hamsters, fish, guinea pigs, and rabbits, for instance, are superb choices for young children embarking on their first pet experience, offering companionship and invaluable lessons in responsibility. If you're planning to move or undergo significant lifestyle changes, it may be advantageous to wait until your situation stabilizes before welcoming a pet into your home, ensuring a seamless transition for everyone involved. Different breeds of dogs have unique requirements, so it's important to choose a pet that aligns with your lifestyle and available resources. Before acquiring a pet, conduct thorough research on the behaviors and needs of the various animals you're considering to make an informed decision. Approaching this decision with an open mind can lead to delightful surprises and help you find the perfect pet for your family. Consider the specific needs associated with different types of pets: Dogs, regardless of breed, typically require substantial attention, regular exercise, and ample space to roam. Cats are intelligent and independent; although they need less supervision, they still crave your affection and time to prevent behavioral issues. Hamsters, gerbils, ferrets, and other rodents are budget-friendly, have short lifespans, and can be excellent starter pets, offering young children their first experience of responsibility. However, rodents can emit potent, distinctive odors that can be challenging to manage, requiring regular cleaning and maintenance. Fish require meticulous monitoring and care to thrive and do not offer physical affection, making them a unique but demanding addition to your home. Caring for fish is akin to tending a garden, where patience and attention are essential for cultivating a flourishing environment. Lizards are generally solitary and easy to care for, but they offer little affection and can be difficult to diagnose when ill, necessitating a keen eye for their health. Birds can be quite messy and frequently loud, necessitating a commitment to maintaining a clean and tranquil environment. They also come with high costs and occasional mood swings, particularly larger birds like parrots, which require careful consideration before ownership. Rabbits are sociable and welcoming pets, bringing warmth and joy to a household; however, they can also be noisy and messy, necessitating regular maintenance. It is unwise to simply decide 'I want a dog' (or any other animal) without considering the specific needs and requirements of that breed. Some breeds, such as Border Collies, are natural shepherds with an innate sheep-herding instinct, making them ideal for one person but potentially challenging for families with small children. This instinct means that if a child wanders too far from the group, the collie will attempt to herd them back, showcasing its natural tendencies. Collies may nip at sheep to guide them, which could result in serious injuries to children if not properly managed. Thoroughly researching breed behavior is crucial for understanding the potential risks and responsibilities associated with different pets. A pet should live in an environment where it feels comfortable, safe, and has everything it needs for a fulfilling life. Some animals, like cats, are highly adaptable and can thrive in diverse settings, from rural areas to urban centers, while others have more specific requirements. For example, horses need vast pastureland and secure shelter for their well-being. Animals that roam freely in the house, rather than being confined to tanks or cages, require quiet sleeping areas away from household traffic. Indoor cats, which are often kept inside, should have access to a regularly cleaned litter tray to maintain their hygiene and comfort. Some pets are more costly than others, so it's crucial to assess whether you can afford and manage the responsibilities of owning a pet. Pet ownership involves initial costs for supplies and setup, including essentials like food bowls, bedding, and toys. Depending on the type of pet you choose, you might need items such as a crate, an aquarium, or leashes, each tailored to the pet\u2019s specific needs. Remember the ongoing expenses associated with pet care, including food and regular veterinary visits, to ensure your pet's well-being. Budget not only for regular food purchases but also for preventive veterinary care, such as vaccinations, as well as emergency treatments, to keep your pet healthy. Such care is vital for maintaining your pet's health but can be quite expensive, so plan accordingly. Pets, driven by curiosity and hunger, can get into trouble if boundaries or safe spaces are not established, emphasizing the need for a secure environment. Birds may fly out open windows, lizards can scurry around the house, and dogs or cats might dash into the street, posing significant risks. Assess potential escape routes and ensure that food is stored out of reach to keep your pet safe from harm. Remove dangerous items like knives and toxic foods to prevent accidents and ensure a safe living space. Consider installing a fence to provide your pet with safe outdoor time, allowing them to explore while staying secure.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Proving theorems is one of the most fundamental goals in mathematics, requiring complex mathematical reasoning and a rich store of mathematical knowledge, making it a cornerstone of mathematical inquiry. Recently, large language models (LLMs) [15, 25, 20, 3, 6, 24, 33] have made great progress in solving grade-school [5] and even high-school level math problems [8] through chain-of-thought reasoning [28]. LLMs can interact with proof assistants like Lean, Coq, or Isabelle to enhance their theorem-proving capabilities. However, the performance of LLMs in theorem proving is still unsatisfactory. One primary reason for this weakness is the lack of sufficient data, which restricts the model's ability to learn effectively. The conventional approach for LLMs in learning theorem proving relies on expert iterations, which are essential for their development. LLMs search for proofs in mathematical problem sets and statement collections, learning from successful examples and refining their theorem-proving abilities. However, the data available in MiniF2F is limited due to the substantial labor required to formalize problems, posing a significant challenge for human experts. Mathlib is a vast dataset that formalizes various math subjects in Lean, focusing primarily on fundamental math theorems rather than competition-level problems. A crucial step towards developing an improved automatic theorem-proving model is to generate a sufficient number of high-quality formalized statements, which are essential for its development. This work introduces Lean Workbook, an iterative autoformalization pipeline accompanied by a comprehensive Lean problem set, which facilitates the development of an improved automatic theorem-proving model. We develop our autoformalization model using active learning strategies, which enable the model to learn and improve its performance. This work was conducted during internships at the Shanghai AI Laboratory, where we gained significant experience in developing, testing, and refining the autoformalization model. Our paper has been submitted to the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, where it will undergo rigorous review by the scientific community. Please note that this document contains proprietary information and should not be shared or distributed prior to the completion of the conference review process. Figure 1 illustrates the data contribution of our Lean Workbook pipeline, demonstrating its potential to enhance theorem-proving capabilities. The three rounds of filtering substantially impact the accuracy of the output data and significantly improve its quality. We applied the pipeline to the AOPS and Compfiles data sources, producing 21 formalized IMO questions and approximately 57,000 pieces of synthetic training data for autoformalization. In each phase, we use our model to translate natural language problems into formal statements and then back-translate them into natural language, with problems sourced from the math contest forum. We use the Lean compiler and Natural Language Inference (NLI) to validate the accuracy of our formalizations, ensuring the quality of our results. We identify and correct invalid formalizations with the assistance of human experts, who then add them to the training set, refining the model's performance. With the addition of human-labeled data pairs, the model learns to translate between Lean 4 formal language and natural language questions of various problem types, expanding its capabilities and improving its accuracy. In the final phase, we autoformalized 57,000 math problems, achieving significant results and demonstrating the model's potential. Our manual review confirms an accuracy of 93.5% for a random sample of the Lean Workbook, indicating the model's high performance and reliability. This filtering process produces 21 new formal statements of IMO questions that are not present in Compfiles 3, further expanding the model's capabilities and improving its performance.

This is largely achieved via chain-of-thought reasoning [28]. Moreover, LLMs have shown potential in interacting with proof assistants like Lean [18], Coq [26], and Isabelle [21] to tackle theorem proving. However, the performance of theorem proving is not satisfying with LLMs [34]. Despite these advancements, the performance of LLMs in theorem proving remains less than satisfactory [34]. A significant factor contributing to this shortcoming is data sparsity. The predominant strategy employed by LLMs in learning theorem proving involves the method of expert iteration [1, 30, 14, 22, 31]. In this approach, LLMs explore proofs within a given set of mathematical problems and statements, such as those found in MiniF2F [34] and Mathlib [17], learning from successful trajectories. However, MiniF2F suffers from a limited data volume, as formalizing problems demands considerable effort from human experts. Although Mathlib provides an extensive dataset encompassing formalizations across various mathematical subjects in Lean, it primarily focuses on fundamental theorems rather than contest-level challenges. Consequently, an essential initial step towards enhancing automatic theorem-proving models is the creation of a sufficient number of high-quality formalized statements.\n\nIn this work, we introduce Lean Workbook: an iterative autoformalization pipeline, accompanied by a comprehensive Lean problem set. Our approach is rooted in active learning to refine the autoformalization model. This work was conducted during internships at Shanghai AI Laboratory and has been submitted to the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks. Please refrain from distributing this document.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the data contribution of our Lean Workbook pipeline. Through three rounds of filtering, we largely ensure the accuracy of the output data. By applying the pipeline to the AOPS and Compfiles data sources, we successfully derive 21 formalized International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) questions and approximately 57,000 synthetic training data points for autoformalization. In each iteration, our model translates natural language problems into formal statements and then back-translates them to natural language, sourced from math contest forums. We employ the Lean compiler and Natural Language Inference (NLI) to validate the formalizations. For instances of invalid formalization, we enlist human experts to amend them, ensuring they become valid and incorporating them into the training dataset. With the addition of human-labeled data pairs, the translation model gradually becomes adept at converting between Lean 4 formal language and natural language questions across various problem types. By the final round of autoformalization, 57,000 math problems were processed. A manual examination of a random sample from the Lean Workbook reported an accuracy rate of 93.5%. This meticulous filtering process also yielded 21 new formal statements for the IMO questions, which were not present in Compfiles.\n\nIn conclusion, the contributions of our work are manifold: \u2022 We propose an active learning pipeline specifically designed for the autoformalization of natural language questions. \u2022 We have open-sourced both our translation model and the pipeline, facilitating the autoformalization of mathematical statements across diverse topics. \u2022 We provide an open-source dataset comprising 57,000 formalized math problems, of which 5,000 include formal solutions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for autoformalization and automated theorem proving. \u2022 We have successfully formalized 21 new IMO questions that were previously absent in Compfiles.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to significantly advance the field of automated theorem proving, providing robust tools and datasets that not only enhance the capabilities of LLMs but also pave the way for future research and development in this critical area of mathematical inquiry. By bridging the gap between natural language and formalized mathematical statements, we aspire to contribute to a more seamless and efficient process of theorem proving, ultimately expanding the horizons of what is achievable through computational means in mathematics. This work underscores the potential of integrating human expertise with advanced computational models, setting a foundation for ongoing innovation and exploration in the realm of mathematical theorem proving and beyond.", "scores": {"ppl": 74.85284423828125, "some": 0.8951656023661295, "bart": -2.2313976287841797, "acc": 0.5}}}
{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Addition is generally a fairly simple concept, but it takes on special meaning when working with vectors. A single vector represents a movement, a force, or some other physical element acting upon an object. If there are two or more forces acting at the same time, you can \u201cadd\u201d these forces to find the resultant force acting on the object. For example, think of a golf ball that's hit into the air: one force is the initial hit with its angle and magnitude, and another might be the wind with its own angle and magnitude. Adding these two forces can describe the resulting travel of the ball, but you need to determine the components of each vector first. For example, suppose the golf ball is hit at a 30-degree angle upward with a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). Using trigonometry, the two component vectors are, therefore: Vertical=130sin\u2061(30)=65mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=130\\sin(30)=65{\\text{mph}}} Horizontal=130cos\u2061(30)=112.6mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=130\\cos(30)=112.6{\\text{mph}}}. Then consider the vector that represents the force of the wind, blowing the ball downward at an angle of 10 degrees and a speed of 10 mph (16.1 km/h). The wind\u2019s two components can be calculated similarly: Vertical=10sin\u2061(\u221210)=\u22121.74mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=10\\sin(-10)=-1.74{\\text{mph}}} Horizontal=10cos\u2061(\u221210)=9.85mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=10\\cos(-10)=9.85{\\text{mph}}}. Notice that we use an angle of -10 degrees because the wind is blowing down, acting against the force of the hit. Since component vectors are always measured at right angles, you can add them directly by matching the horizontal component of each vector and doing the same for the vertical components. For this sample, the resultant vertical vector is the sum of the two components: Vertical=65+(\u22121.74)=63.26{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=65+(-1.74)=63.26} Horizontal=112.6+9.85=122.45{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=112.6+9.85=122.45}. Ultimately, you want to know the net effect of both the golf swing and the wind on the ball; knowing the two components allows you to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Recall that the component vectors represent the legs of a right triangle, and the resultant vector is the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem, c2=a2+b2{\\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}}, you can calculate this as follows: Resultant2=63.262+122.452{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}^{2}=63.26^{2}+122.45^{2}} Resultant2=18,995.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}^{2}=18,995.83}. Resultant=18,995.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}={\\sqrt {18,995.83}}} Resultant=137.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}=137.83}. Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force on the ball with a magnitude of 137.83 mph (221.82 km/h). Notice that this is slightly higher than the force of the initial hit, because the wind is pushing the ball forward at the same time that it pushes it down. Knowing the force of the resultant vector is only half the solution; the other half is finding the net angle of the resultant vector. In this example, because the golf swing applies an upward force and the wind applies a downward, though lesser, force, you need to determine the resulting angle. Sketch a right triangle, labeling the horizontal base as the forward vector component of 122.45 and the vertical leg as the upward vector component of 63.26, with the hypotenuse representing the resultant vector with a magnitude of 137.83. You can use either the sine function with the vertical component or the cosine function with the horizontal component to find the angle, as the result will be the same. sin\u2061\u03b8=63.26137.83{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta ={\\frac {63.26}{137.83}}} sin\u2061\u03b8=0.459{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta =0.459}. \u03b8=arcsin\u2061(0.459){\\displaystyle \\theta =\\arcsin(0.459)} \u03b8=27.32{\\displaystyle \\theta =27.32}. Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force acting on the ball at an upward angle of 27.32 degrees, which makes sense as it's slightly lower than the swing's angle of 30 degrees due to the downward force of the wind. However, the golf swing is a much stronger force than the wind in this example, so the angle is still close to 30. To report the resultant vector, give both its angle and magnitude: in the golf ball example, the resultant vector has a magnitude of 137.83 mph (221.82 km/h) at an angle of 27.32 degrees above the horizontal.", "scores": {"ppl": 17.66926383972168, "some": 0.876709779103597, "bart": -1.3538908958435059, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Addition is a straightforward concept but gains significance with vectors. A single vector represents movement, force, or a physical element acting on an object. When multiple forces act simultaneously, you can add these forces to find the resultant force. For instance, consider a golf ball hit into the air. One force is the initial hit, defined by its angle and magnitude, while another might be the wind, with its own characteristics. Combining these forces can describe the ball's trajectory. Before adding vectors, determine each component. Using trigonometry, find the horizontal and vertical components of each force. Suppose the ball is hit at a 30-degree angle upward at 130 mph (210 km/h). The vertical component is 65 mph, and the horizontal is 112.6 mph. Now, consider the wind blowing downward at 10 degrees at 10 mph (16.1 km/h). Its vertical component is -1.74 mph, and the horizontal is 9.85 mph. The negative angle indicates the downward direction. Add the components: the resultant vertical vector is 63.26 mph, and the horizontal is 122.45 mph. These results show the net force on the ball. The net effect can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The component vectors form the legs of a right triangle, and the resultant vector is the hypotenuse. Calculate the resultant magnitude as 137.83 mph (221.82 km/h). This is slightly more than the initial hit's force due to wind assistance.

My trust in my group member's capabilities was somewhat lacking, leading to a sense of apprehension about the presentation. Despite these concerns, we managed to deliver our presentation successfully, a fact that was later confirmed by the impressive grade we received.

These models are initially trained on large unsupervised text corpora and are later fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. Known as large language models (LLMs) due to their extensive parameters, these models are also applied to learn program representations from source code. Just as with natural language, program representations learned from code can enhance performance in several downstream program analysis tasks.\n\nIn 2020, Feng et al. introduced CodeBERT, a pre-trained model based on BERT, which supports various NL-PL applications, including code search and documentation generation. Following this, in 2021, Guo et al. developed GraphCodeBERT, enhancing CodeBERT's ability to capture semantic information like data flow. More recently, ChatGPT has been utilized for tasks such as code refinement and vulnerability discovery. In industry, GitHub Copilot, powered by GPT, assists developers by suggesting snippets and completing functions within Integrated Development Environments.\n\nA fundamental difference between natural language and programming language can lead to challenges when NLP models are applied directly to code. In natural language, a word's meaning is context-dependent, whereas, in programming, any string can be assigned to variables, methods, or functions. This flexibility means most strings in code might not carry significant information and can be replaced without losing meaning. If an LLM depends too heavily on variable names, it may struggle when these names lack useful information or are misleading.\n\nNatural language uses a limited vocabulary, while programming language allows for limitless word creation, as programmers can invent strings for variables. This raises questions about whether word embeddings from NLP are efficient for program analysis. If a model designer overlooks differences between natural and programming languages and applies NLP methods naively, the model might face limitations. Our paper introduces a taxonomy classifying programming language features into literal and logical categories. We aim to explore how these features affect pre-trained models' performance in downstream tasks.\n\nTo assess this, we created eight datasets masking different features to measure their impact quantitatively. In these datasets, variable or method/function names are replaced with nonsensical or misleading terms. Using CodeBERT, we performed two code analysis tasks on these datasets to evaluate naming's impact on model performance. Our results show that naming strategies significantly influence code analysis tasks with LLMs, indicating a reliance on well-defined names.\n\nExperiments with CodeBERT reveal how literal and logical features affect performance. Though these models have exceptional capabilities, their effectiveness can be compromised by unreliable features in analyzed code. For example, code from decompilation or non-conventional naming might reduce accuracy, as LLMs generalize only from patterns in their training data.

They are a chief means of communication for about 70 million deaf people worldwide. Automatic sign language technologies have the potential to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals, making deaf video media more searchable and indexable. These technologies could enhance effective video content searching and improve accessibility. Automatic sign language processing has recently gained attention in the computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) communities. Notable examples include advancements in gesture recognition. Additionally, there have been improvements in translation algorithms. Yin et al. (2021) recommend focusing on real-world data in NLP sign language studies, highlighting its importance for practical applications. Many studies still rely on data from controlled environments. For example, this includes studio settings, as noted by Mart\u00ednez et al. (2002) and Kim et al. (2017), and researchers like Karen Livescu. Specific domains studied by Forster et al. (2016) are also included. These datasets often fail to capture challenges like varied visual conditions and different levels of signing fluency. Until recently, automatic processing of sign language videos \"in the wild\" was largely unexplored. The focus remained on tasks such as isolated sign recognition, as seen in works by Albanie et al. (2020), Joze and Koller (2019), and Li et al. (2020). In this work, we explore the search and retrieval of arbitrary fingerspelled content in real-world American Sign Language (ASL) videos. This highlights its importance for accessible communication. Figure 1 illustrates our two search tasks. Word search (FWS) determines which words are fingerspelled in a sign language video. Video search (FVS) looks for sign language videos with a specific fingerspelled query. These sign language videos are untrimmed, meaning they include regular signs alongside fingerspelling. They are downsampled here for visualization. This approach provides a more comprehensive representation of natural signing contexts. Since fingerspelling occurs sparsely in the signing stream, its explicit detection can potentially enhance search performance by filtering out unrelated signs. To this end, we propose FSS-Net, an end-to-end model that detects fingerspelling in unconstrained signing videos. It matches the detected fingerspelling to text queries.", "scores": {"ppl": 98.63812255859375, "some": 0.8744219144185384, "bart": -1.9866173267364502, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Sign languages are a fascinating and integral form of natural language that convey meaning through dynamic sequences of handshapes and gestures. They also incorporate non-manual elements such as facial expressions and body movements.

The development and implementation of automatic sign language technologies hold the promise of significantly bridging the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals. These technologies would make it easier to access and interact with sign language content, thereby rendering deaf video media more searchable and indexable.\n\nIn recent times, automatic sign language processing has garnered increasing attention within the computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) research communities. Researchers like Yin et al. (2021) have put forward several recommendations for advancing the study of sign languages within NLP research. Among their suggestions is the call for a greater emphasis on utilizing real-world data. Historically, most studies on sign language have been based on data collected in controlled environments. This includes either studio settings, as seen in the works of Mart\u00ednez et al. (2002) and Kim et al. (2017), or within specific domains, such as the study by Forster et al. (2016). Unfortunately, these datasets do not fully capture the challenges of real-world signing videos, which involve a range of visual conditions and varying levels of fluency in signing.\n\nThe automatic processing of sign language videos \"in the wild\" has not been thoroughly addressed until more recently. Current efforts are still largely confined to tasks like isolated sign recognition, as explored by Albanie et al. (2020), Joze and Koller (2019), and Li et al. (2020). There has also been work on fingerspelling recognition, as demonstrated by Shi et al. (2018, 2019). Our research seeks to take this further by studying the search and retrieval of arbitrary fingerspelled content in real-world American Sign Language (ASL) videos.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the tasks we address: (a) Fingerspelled Word Search (FWS), which involves determining which words are fingerspelled in a sign language video clip, and (b) Fingerspelling Video Search (FVS), which focuses on searching for sign language videos that contain a fingerspelled query word or phrase. The sign language videos we work with are untrimmed, meaning they include both regular signs and fingerspelling, and they are downsampled for visualization purposes.\n\nFingerspelling itself is a distinctive component of sign language, where words are represented by a sequence of handshapes or movements corresponding to individual letters. This process is especially useful for lexical items that do not have specific signs, such as proper nouns or technical terms. Fingerspelling holds an important place in sign language communication. For instance, it accounts for 12-35% of ASL, according to Padden and Gunsauls (2003). Crucially, fingerspelled segments in a sign language video often carry a significant amount of the content, particularly when conveying important information like named entities.\n\nMost previous research on fingerspelling has concentrated on recognition, as shown in the studies by Shi et al. (2018, 2019). This involves transcribing a fingerspelling video clip into text. However, automatic recognition assumes that the boundaries of fingerspelled segments are known at the time of testing, which may not align with real-world applications. Complete transcription might not always be necessary to extract the required information from a video.\n\nIn contrast, fingerspelling search, such as retrieving sign language videos based on a query word, presents a more practical task. It is an essential component of general video search involving sign language. Beyond introducing this task, our research addresses the question of whether explicitly localizing fingerspelling temporally can aid in its search and retrieval. We also explore how best to achieve such localization. Given that fingerspelling occurs sporadically within the signing stream, explicitly detecting fingerspelling could enhance search performance by filtering out unrelated signs.\n\nTo this end, we propose an innovative end-to-end model known as FSS-Net. This model is designed to jointly detect fingerspelling from unconstrained signing video and match it to text queries. Our approach consistently outperforms a range of baseline methods that either do not involve explicit detection or rely on an off-the-shelf fingerspelling detector. The results demonstrate a substantial margin of improvement, underscoring the efficacy of our model in addressing the challenges associated with fingerspelling search and retrieval in real-world contexts.", "scores": {"ppl": 46.11294937133789, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.2591803073883057, "acc": 0.5}}}

(2021) and Radlinski and Craswell (2017). For example, the emerging paradigm of conversational search facilitates information-seeking within multi-turn dialogue interactions. Conversational search allows users to explore and refine their searches progressively to discover relevant knowledge within an information space. A key challenge is bridging the gap between user queries in natural language and machine-readable knowledge representations. Data-to-text generation tackles this challenge by converting structured data into coherent, human-readable text using methods that range from rule-based approaches to supervised neural networks. Unlike traditional supervised learning, LLMs employ a self-supervised approach by predicting tokens from large volumes of unlabeled data. By increasing model size and training data, this approach has uncovered the impressive multitask learning abilities of LLMs, as demonstrated by Radford et al. (2019) and Brown et al. (2020). One advantage of LLMs is their ability to perform prompt-based (in-context) learning, which enables tasks like question-answering, semantic parsing, and text summarization through well-designed prompts (Liu et al., 2023). Recently, there has been a growing focus on enhancing LLMs for conversational interactions through dialogue corpus pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (Thoppilan et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022). While LLMs are promising for conversational interactions due to their capacity to manage diverse inputs, they also present challenges, such as hallucinating or omitting crucial information and lacking transparency regarding their sources (Dou et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023). To tackle these challenges, it is crucial to ground their outputs in verifiable factual data from knowledge graphs. Despite their potential, there has been limited systematic exploration of LLMs' ability to verbalize graph-structured data. To assess LLMs in knowledge-based text generation, we compare four models of varying sizes and training objectives, particularly those optimized for conversational interaction. Using the WebNLG benchmark dataset, we assess the models' capability to generate natural language from semantic triples. We conduct various experiments to explore different model configurations and prompting techniques, gaining insights into their specific capabilities and limitations. Our contributions include adapting the WebNLG benchmark to evaluate both closed- and open-source LLMs, conducting a detailed error analysis, offering insights into model performance using both automatic metrics and human evaluation, and creating a new dataset with 26,422 conversations for triple-to-text verbalizations in a chat completion format.

Information gathered from financial reports, news, or social media through machine learning can indicate company performance or provide insights into market trends. Many industry players aim to extract this information to gain a competitive edge, driven by the desire to enhance their strategic positioning. For instance, firms use these insights to predict future internal gains and losses, while investors leverage specific information for trading. However, features of financial text, such as specialized jargon and complex structures, present significant challenges for models trained on general data. The unique terminology and complexity of financial documents often cause general language models to underperform, suggesting the need for domain adaptation to improve accuracy in interpretation and analysis. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their demonstrated NLP capabilities make them a promising area for further research. Although even top general language models sometimes struggle with financial tasks, recent proposals advocate for adapting LLMs to the financial domain to overcome these challenges. Finance-specific models like BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023) have been developed as multitasking generative models tailored for financial text comprehension and generation. Nonetheless, these refined models still have potential for improvement in performance and training strategy efficiency, particularly in optimizing resource use and accuracy. This paper explores various methods for adapting LLMs to the financial sector, focusing on enhancing model performance and domain-specific precision through techniques like domain adaptation and fine-tuning for financial sentiment analysis, using two foundational models for experiments. We highlight smaller, more manageable models, up to 1.5 billion parameters, to investigate the capabilities of models that are accessible with relatively minimal hardware requirements. Although these adapted models are smaller than the current state-of-the-art, they show similar or superior performance, especially in specific financial tasks. Additionally, we offer a curated data collection, providing a comprehensive set of financial documents and reports with detailed task instructions. We detail the dataset creation process, emphasizing the use of advanced LLMs to generate synthetic instructions for fine-tuning smaller models.

The ability to extract relevant information from financial reports, news articles, or social media posts through machine learning algorithms can offer critical insights into a company's performance or broader market trends. Many stakeholders in the financial industry are keen to leverage this information, using it as a strategic resource that can provide a competitive edge. For example, firms might use it to forecast future profits and losses internally, while investors might seek differential information for more informed trading decisions. Practitioners interested in tracking financial assets also find these insights beneficial. However, financial texts often present challenges for NLP models trained on general datasets due to their specialized terminology and inherent complexity. These challenges suggest that domain adaptation is essential to enhance the accuracy of analysis and interpretation in financial contexts. As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve rapidly, they have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling NLP tasks, making them an attractive focus for research and application. Despite the advancements in general-purpose language models, they frequently fall short when tasked with specific financial applications. As a result, there have been recent efforts to adapt LLMs specifically for the financial domain. Models like BloombergGPT have been designed as multitasking generative models tailored for understanding and generating financial texts. Nevertheless, these specialized models still show potential for further enhancements, both in terms of performance and the efficiency of their training methodologies. This paper addresses several facets of adapting LLMs to the financial domain by exploring various strategies for domain adaptation and fine-tuning, particularly for financial sentiment analysis. A series of experiments have been conducted on two different foundational models to assess their effectiveness. The research particularly emphasizes smaller, more manageable models with up to 1.5 billion parameters, aiming to explore feasible options that require relatively low hardware resources. Even though these adapted models are smaller than the current state-of-the-art, they demonstrate comparable or even superior performance in specific tasks. Additionally, the study introduces a curated data collection comprising two primary datasets: one constructed from financial documents and reports, and another consisting of a set of instructions for financial tasks. The paper meticulously outlines the process of creating these datasets, focusing on how more advanced LLMs can be used to generate synthetic instructions to fine-tune smaller models. Beyond the primary focus on financial sentiment analysis, the study also evaluates other tasks to assess the multitasking capabilities of the developed models. By delving into these areas, the research aims to contribute valuable insights into the fine-tuning and adaptation of LLMs within the financial domain, ultimately enhancing their utility and performance in specialized financial applications.", "scores": {"ppl": 47.5142936706543, "some": 0.8858680725097656, "bart": -2.291840076446533, "acc": 1.0}}}

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Recent advancements in large language models have transformed Natural Language Processing, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such as machine translation [16, 22], question answering [2, 3], and text generation [2, 15]. However, despite these successes, our understanding of how these models internally process and represent information remains limited [13, 24]. Previous studies have indicated that internal model representations can reveal how models plan ahead in text generation. By modifying neural activations\u2014specifically by transferring them between different locations during inference\u2014we can uncover existing causal relationships [7, 19, 21, 26, 29]. For instance, Pal et al. utilize causal intervention methods in their Future Lens approach [14] to show that individual hidden states at position t contain signals rich enough to predict future tokens at t + 2 or beyond, enhancing model performance [1, 6]. Nonetheless, existing interpretability research predominantly focuses on token-level predictions, examining how models predict individual words or tokens [11], rather than delving into broader contexts like the thematic coherence of a sentence or paragraph. Our work seeks to bridge the gap between token-level and paragraph-level understanding by exploring whether the information content of single-token activations remains relevant when considering sequences of tokens, with particular attention to the double newline (\"\\n\\n\") token. In section 2, we demonstrate through a preliminary experiment that text structure is embedded in a language model\u2019s attention scores. In section 3, we explore the extent to which a model, at the start of a paragraph, has already planned the remainder of the generated text. To investigate this, we patch activations onto a model using a neutral prompt\u2014a double newline\u2014and examine whether the future paragraph contains information transferred at the hidden representation level. The code for our experiments is available anonymously, and computation details can be found in Appendix B. This is a preprint currently under review. Section 2 poses the question: Is text structure encoded in the model\u2019s attention patterns? To motivate our approach, we first demonstrate that sequences of paragraphs can be identified through the analysis of an LLM\u2019s attention activations. We generate texts by prompting a model with instructions like: \"Tell me about topic 1 in k words \\n\\n Tell me about topic 2 in k words.\" These generated texts, referred to as original contexts, are uniformly structured by instructing the model not to generate headings or additional comments. We then extract and inspect the combined attention patterns across all heads for each model-generated text. To observe the context switch, we conduct two key analyses, averaging across the textual generations: (1) the distribution of attention weights near the topic change and (2) the cosine similarity of attention output activations within and across paragraphs or topics. Experiment (1) assesses the extent to which attention heads focus on the current paragraph, while (2) investigates whether attention outputs differ between paragraphs. Figure 1 illustrates the results of our attention pattern analysis, averaged over 1,000 model-generated original contexts that share a common structure. In our study, we used 20 prompts (i.e., pairs of topics) and generated 50 texts per prompt, totaling 1,000 generated texts. The generations were implemented with the Gemma 2, 9b model at a temperature of 0.3, and activations were retrieved using the HuggingFace Transformers library [25]. On the left, the attention weights indicate that the model tends to focus almost exclusively on previous tokens from the same paragraph. On the right, the cosine similarities of attention outputs demonstrate how strongly text structure is encoded within various layers. In the first 18 layers, the cosine similarities of attention activations increase within paragraphs and decrease across paragraphs, suggesting that the model learns abstract representations in early layers and gradually develops an understanding of the paragraph topic. A consistent finding across all experimental settings is that distinctions between paragraphs diminish in the final layers, from layer 30 onwards. We conjecture that this may be because the model eventually produces text in a very similar overall form for both topics. An additional plot displaying the cosine similarities for all 42 model layers can be found in Appendix A. Altogether, our preliminary experiments suggest that our model maintains strong contextual awareness during text generation, aligning with research that supports consistent text embedding fine-tuning [28] and \"planning\" [8, 9, 26].

Despite these successes, our understanding of how these models internally process and represent information remains limited. Previous studies have demonstrated that internal model representations can reveal how models plan ahead in text generation. By intervening on neural activations\u2014specifically by patching them between different locations at inference time\u2014we can uncover existing causal relationships. For instance, Pal et al. use causal intervention methods in their Future Lens approach to show that individual hidden states at position t contain signals rich enough to predict future tokens at t + 2 or beyond. This insight has been used to improve the performance of models. \n\nHowever, existing interpretability research predominantly focuses on token-level predictions by examining how models predict individual words or tokens, rather than exploring broader contexts such as the thematic coherence of a sentence or paragraph. Our work aims to bridge the gap between token-level and paragraph-level understanding by investigating whether the information content of single-token activations remains relevant when we consider sequences of tokens, with a specific focus on the \"\\n\\n\" double newline token. We hypothesize that these activations contain information about the structure and content of the following paragraph, providing insight into the model\u2019s comprehension of larger textual units.\n\nIn section 2, we demonstrate through a preliminary experiment that text structure is embedded in a language model\u2019s attention scores. In section 3, we examine the extent to which a model, at the start of a paragraph, has already planned the rest of the generated text. To explore this, we patch activations onto a model with a neutral prompt\u2014a double newline\u2014and investigate whether the future paragraph contains information transferred at the hidden representation level. The code for our experiments is available anonymously, and compute details can be found in Appendix B.\n\nTo motivate our approach, we first demonstrate that sequences of paragraphs can be identified through the analysis of a large language model\u2019s attention activations. We generate texts by prompting a model with instructions phrased as: \"Tell me about topic 1 in k words \\n\\n tell me about topic 2 in k words.\" These generated texts, referred to as original contexts, are structured uniformly by instructing the model not to generate headings and additional comments.

These LLMs are celebrated for both their performance and diverse applications. Shanahan et al. (2023) propose role-playing as a novel application for LLMs, encompassing virtual role-playing games and social skills training (OthlinghausWulhorst et al., 2020). This application involves using LLMs to emulate human or virtual characters' language, behavior, and traits. Fine-tuning has emerged as a key method in natural language processing (NLP) to improve pre-trained LLMs for specific tasks, such as role-playing, by enabling better performance in unseen tasks with minimized costs (Chung et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023). Through fine-tuning with ample role-playing data, LLMs can grasp a character's background, features, and typical phrases, allowing them to perform tailored role-playing tasks proficiently.\n\nA direct method for gathering role-playing data is creating a character's script. However, research highlights that manually crafting scripts is costly (Shao et al., 2023), and fine-tuning models directly on these scripts yields subpar results (Wang et al., 2023). To address these issues, several innovative methods have been introduced. ChatHaruhi (Li et al., 2023) suggests a technique where LLMs generate dialogue for target roles using questions from original narratives. Character-LLM (Shao et al., 2023) develops dialogue data by extracting character profiles from sources like wikis and crafting scenes based on these profiles. ROLELLM (Wang et al., 2023) investigates the Context-Instruction method, using cutting-edge LLMs to create dialogue from character profiles and structured historical conversation data.\n\nIn this study, we propose a prompt-based framework that employs state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs exclusively for generating role-playing data and assessing LLMs' role-playing abilities. Our framework involves four key steps: \n\n1. **Role Plot Construction**: Utilizing the inherent memory of SOTA LLMs, like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), we craft unique plots for each character using precisely formulated prompts.\n   \n2. **Dialogue Generation**: Based on these plots, we prompt the SOTA LLM to produce questions and answers, which are then organized into well-structured datasets.\n\n3. **Low-Rank Adaptation (Lora) Tuning**: With sufficient role-playing data, we fine-tune a selection of open-source LLMs using the Low-Rank adaptation (Lora) method (Hu et al., 2021). This process helps the LLMs internalize the character's backstory, tone, and signature phrases, thereby enhancing their performance.\n\n4. **Performance Evaluation**: Post fine-tuning, we leverage the SOTA LLM to assess the role-playing proficiency of both original and fine-tuned LLMs using specially crafted prompts.

If a confidence score exceeds a threshold, that model is selected to end inference. However, cascade-based models have limitations in cross-lingual scenarios. To address this, we add a calibration step to mPLMs because the confidence score relies on the highest output. First, we normalize logits to reduce over-confidence during fine-tuning. Then, we apply temperature scaling with a learnable scalar. This framework calibrates each model for reliable confidence scores. This approach enhances model performance and generalization, improving efficiency and accuracy across languages.

When you identify a stem for removal, trace it back to the base and make a straight cut just outside the joint of the parent stem. Immediately disinfect the shears after trimming dead or diseased stems to prevent the spread of disease throughout the plant. Assume any dead stem died due to a disease, and disinfection after each pruning session is crucial, even if it requires more bleach. This will keep your cactus healthy and beautiful. Cut stems at their base, usually located along the outer edges, until the plant is fairly uniform on all sides. Snails are easy to spot and remove with store-bought snail bait, but other bugs require specific measures for prevention. Mealybugs, with their waxy, white, cottony appearance, are slow-moving and usually cluster along leaf veins or spines. Scale insects resemble small, cottony dome-shaped shells and attach themselves to stems and leaves but can be pried off. Spider-mites are hard to see but leave signs like webbing and small brown dots, particularly on younger growth. Tapping the plant over white paper will reveal spider-mites as dust-like particles. These insects suck the plant's juices, leading to weak, wrinkled, or shriveled leaves, and severe infestations can kill the plant. Initial symptoms include stickiness or black mold on or near the plant. A diluted alcohol solution of one part alcohol to three parts water is effective against spider-mites and other hard-to-spot bugs. However, use caution as it may damage the cactus's epidermis; test a small area first. Insecticidal soap, available at garden or home improvement stores, may also damage your cactus, so use it sparingly and test a small area before applying to the entire plant.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "There is a wide variety of essential nutrients you need in your diet to help reduce the symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Many individuals choose to take dietary supplements, such as fish oil pills, to gain the essential nutrients required for maintaining their health. However, the overall effectiveness of these dietary substitutes in managing symptoms is still unclear and needs further research. You should make it a priority to focus on getting your nutrition primarily from real foods rather than relying on supplements and oils. You do not need to overly complicate your diet plan specifically for managing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms effectively. A healthy and balanced overall diet will help you obtain the nutrients necessary for maintaining good health. Stick to incorporating a variety of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins into your daily diet for optimal health. Omega-3 fatty acids can significantly help ease the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by reducing inflammation and pain effectively. These nutrients are also beneficial for improving your overall health and well-being beyond arthritis management. Strive to include fish in your meals at least a few times each week to gain these valuable health benefits. By doing so, you may notice a significant reduction in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis over time. The following fish are particularly good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids: Anchovies, Salmon, Sardines, Eel, Tuna, Trout, Mackerel, Herring, and Whitebait. Many people with arthritis develop issues with anemia, which is the body's inability to effectively use iron due to certain chronic diseases. Increasing your iron intake can help offset anemia, so strive to include a variety of iron-rich foods in your diet. If you decide to take an iron supplement, then you may also need to consider taking a stool softener because iron supplements can cause constipation. The following foods are rich in iron: Dark green vegetables such as spinach and kale, Red meat, Lentils, and Haricot beans. Calcium strengthens your bones, which can help reduce the symptoms associated with arthritis significantly. You are at a greater risk for developing osteoporosis if you have arthritis, and a calcium-rich diet can help reduce your risk significantly. Low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, can be a great source of calcium for you. Calcium-enriched milks, including non-dairy options like soy milk, can be an excellent source of calcium as well. Fish eaten with the bones still intact, like sardines, can also help you get more calcium in your diet. In addition to providing calcium, you can also get more Omega-3 fatty acids by consuming such fish regularly. Osteoporosis of the hip or spine is quite common in individuals who suffer from arthritis. Certain foods have not been shown to increase the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at all when consumed. If you experience an arthritis flare-up, you should opt for these safer foods until your pain passes. This will prevent your diet from worsening arthritis pain during the flare-ups you may experience. The following foods should be safe to eat during a flare-up: brown rice, cooked and dry fruits, and cooked vegetables, such as artichoke, broccoli, chards, asparagus, collards, sweet potatoes, and spinach. If you're still experiencing arthritis pain after adjusting your diet, supplements may help you manage the symptoms more effectively. However, you should never simply start taking supplements on your own without proper guidance from a healthcare professional. Without medical testing, you will not know if you have any vitamin deficiencies that need to be addressed appropriately. You also want to make sure vitamins do not interfere with any existing medication you are taking. If you want to try supplements, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options thoroughly. Your doctor may want to run blood tests to see if supplements would help you improve your health.

The work described in this paper is premised on the need to increase the diversity of representation and knowledge in the technologies and language models being built. In particular, we have been working for the past two years to create AI technologies for Indigenous peoples in Brazil, targeting small communities where Indigenous languages are still in use but under threat. Currently, around 200 languages are spoken in Brazil by between one and two million people, but according to Moseley (2010), the vast majority of these languages are in danger of disappearing by the end of the century. Many of these languages are spoken by fewer than 100 people, often elderly, and are at immediate risk. Even the most spoken Indigenous language in Brazil, Tikuna, probably has at most 50,000 speakers. The projects and ideas described here explore how technologies can be developed to support Indigenous communities in documenting, preserving, and revitalizing their languages. Developing language technologies, both for speech and text, for these languages has been difficult in the past because of a lack of resources and linguistic knowledge and of appropriate computational technologies capable of working with small amounts of data. The emergence of LLMs in recent years has positively changed the landscape of opportunities, in our view, for those efforts. Paradoxically, while LLMs need to be trained with vast amounts of data at extremely high costs, they also have the ability to address new needs and requirements through methods such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning with small amounts of data. Fine-tuning LLMs with tiny amounts of data is the main method explored in this work to create useful language tools such as automatic translators, spell-checkers, and editing tools. The recent success of LLMs is, from the technical side, a strong incentive to work on text-based tools. We thus decided to focus our activities on creating writing tools and translators for endangered Indigenous languages, particularly for young people and written content creators of those languages.

This paper discusses research and collaboration with Indigenous communities conducted through a joint project by IBM Research and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, spanning early 2022 to mid-2024, under the Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI). The work is rooted in the need to enhance the diversity of representation and knowledge in the technologies and language models being developed. This involves including a wide range of languages, peoples, places, and genders as part of a social justice and decolonial agenda (Buccella, 2023). Specifically, over the past two years, we have focused on creating AI technologies for Indigenous peoples in Brazil, targeting small communities where Indigenous languages are still spoken but at risk. Currently, about 200 languages are spoken in Brazil by one to two million people, but most of these languages could disappear by the end of the century (Moseley, 2010).

Our projects aim to develop technologies to support Indigenous communities in documenting, preserving, and revitalizing their languages. Previously, developing language technologies for these languages was challenging due to a lack of resources and linguistic knowledge, and appropriate computational technologies to handle small datasets. However, as noted in a UNESCO publication (Llanes-Ortiz, 2023), \u201c... artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and automated speech recognition and voice processing could provide a crucial boost to language revitalization efforts, but these technologies must be developed in line with the rights and provisions set by the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty [...].\u201d The need for voice recognition, machine translation, speech processing, and text analysis technologies for Indigenous languages is critical (Llanes-Ortiz, 2023, p. 168). The emergence of LLMs has positively transformed the landscape of opportunities for these efforts. Paradoxically, while LLMs require vast amounts of data and high costs, they can also address new needs through methods like prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning with small datasets. Although techniques like prompt engineering and RAG may not be effective for endangered Indigenous languages, as standard LLMs likely lack exposure to them, fine-tuning has shown success in some cases. Fine-tuning LLMs with minimal data is the primary method explored in this work to create useful language tools such as automatic translators, spell-checkers, and editing tools. Some techniques described here may also apply to domains beyond Indigenous languages. From a scientific perspective, working with endangered Indigenous languages spoken by small groups ensures that all fine-tuning effects stem from this process, avoiding contamination errors (Pinhanez et al., 2023). The recent success of LLMs is a strong technical incentive to focus on text-based tools. However, orality is a significant component of most Indigenous languages, and most use writing systems adapted from Western languages (Franchetto, 2020). Despite this, creating tools to foster reading and writing is crucial to strengthen endangered Indigenous languages. While young children are often the focus of revitalization efforts, Indigenous people commonly lose interest in their native language during adolescence to early adulthood due to language attrition (Schmid, 2011). This loss of interest is likely compounded by their engagement with the digital world at these ages. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that it is generally easier to forget a language one cannot read or write (Jayasuriya et al., 1992; Burn et al., 2014). Therefore, we focused on developing writing tools and translators for endangered Indigenous languages, particularly for young people and content creators.

A mild wrist sprain, classified as Grade 1, indicates some stretching of the ligament but no significant tearing. In contrast, a moderate sprain, or Grade 2, involves a more substantial tear, affecting up to 50% of the fibers, and may lead to some loss of function. Severe sprains, or Grade 3, are characterized by a complete rupture or a more extensive tearing of the ligaments. With Grade 1 and 2 sprains, wrist movement remains relatively normal, albeit painful, while Grade 3 sprains often result in wrist instability due to the complete tearing of ligaments. Generally, only some Grade 2 and all Grade 3 wrist sprains necessitate medical attention from a healthcare professional. Most Grade 1 and some Grade 2 sprains can be effectively managed at home with appropriate self-care measures. Grade 3 wrist injuries can sometimes involve an avulsion fracture, where the ligament detaches from the bone, taking a small bone fragment with it. The scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid and lunate bones, is the most commonly sprained ligament in the wrist. Due to the wide range of severity in wrist sprains, the type and intensity of pain experienced can also vary greatly among individuals. Grade 1 wrist sprains typically induce mild pain, often described as a soreness that can become sharp with movement. Grade 2 sprains are generally more painful, with sharper and sometimes throbbing pain due to increased inflammation. Paradoxically, Grade 3 sprains may initially be less painful than Grade 2 sprains because the severed ligament does not irritate surrounding nerves as much. However, Grade 3 wrist sprains tend to throb significantly over time due to accumulating inflammation. Wrist sprains involving an avulsion fracture are usually very painful immediately, combining sharp and throbbing sensations. Pain is most pronounced during wrist movement and tends to diminish with immobilization or lack of movement. If your wrist is extremely painful and difficult to move, seeking medical evaluation promptly is crucial. Sprains across all grades respond well to ice or cold therapy, which helps reduce inflammation and numb the nerves causing pain. Ice application is particularly beneficial for Grade 2 and 3 sprains, as these injuries result in more inflammation at the injury site. Applying ice to a sprained wrist for about 10\u201315 minutes every one to two hours immediately after the injury can significantly reduce pain intensity and facilitate easier movement after a day or so. While icing a wrist fracture can also help control pain and inflammation, symptoms often return once the cold therapy effects wear off. Therefore, cold therapy tends to be more effective for sprains than for most fractures. More serious sprains will manifest as more pronounced swelling localized around the injury, making the area appear puffy and enlarged. Small hairline or stress fractures often benefit from cold therapy over the long term, unlike more serious fractures requiring medical intervention. Inflammation causes swelling but is distinct from bruising, which results from localized bleeding into tissues from injured blood vessels. Grade 1 sprains typically do not cause bruising unless the injury is a result of a significant impact that damages small blood vessels. Grade 2 sprains may involve more swelling, but bruising is not always present, depending on the injury's cause. Grade 3 sprains usually cause significant swelling and bruising, as the trauma leading to ruptured ligaments often damages surrounding blood vessels. Swelling from inflammation generally does not cause significant color changes in the skin, aside from some redness due to heat-induced flushing. Bruising appears dark blue and results from blood leaking into tissues just below the skin surface. As the blood breaks down and clears from these tissues, the bruise gradually changes color, eventually fading to a yellowish hue. Most Grade 1 sprains and some Grade 2 sprains feel significantly better within a few days, particularly with rest and cold therapy application. If your wrist feels better, shows no visible swelling, and moves with little pain, medical intervention is likely unnecessary. If a Grade 2 sprain feels significantly better after a few days, even with some lingering swelling and moderate pain, give it more time to recover. However, if the injury has not improved or worsens after a few days, a medical assessment is advisable. Grade 1 and some Grade 2 sprains typically heal within one to two weeks, while Grade 3 sprains, especially those with avulsion fractures, require several months for full recovery.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a widely used technique with large language models (LLMs), as noted by Brown et al. (2020). However, ICL has shown instability with small changes to in-context prompts, such as reordering demonstrations, which lead to significant performance variations (Lu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). This challenge is difficult to manage because we lack a clear understanding of the model\u2019s mechanisms, making us uncertain about how LLMs learn to perform tasks from demonstrations. Previous studies have begun to address this issue, focusing on the label space and the hidden states of the last prompt token (Min et al., 2022; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023). However, these studies have been limited in their scope. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive study on how LLMs extract valuable information from demonstrations to improve task performance, specifically by characterizing the model\u2019s task-encoding tokens. Conceptually, task-encoding tokens are defined as tokens whose representations encode the task-solving process. Since this information cannot be directly extracted from the model's representations, we use a practical proxy: removing the representations of these tokens should diminish task performance. In this paper, we identify and analyze the characteristics of task-encoding tokens for two main reasons: first, identifying these tokens likely offers new insights into how large language models leverage critical information for tasks. Second, analyzing these characteristics helps us understand how they differ from tokens whose representations do not directly affect ICL performance, providing insights into avoiding instability from improper use of these tokens. To identify task-encoding tokens, we categorize tokens into three structural types: template tokens, stopword tokens (including punctuation, conjunctions, etc.), and content tokens. Template tokens intuitively organize the ICL prompt by indicating task input and output, while stopword tokens contribute to the prompt's overall structure. Using these categories, we ablate representations of different token types from ICL test examples, thereby masking partial information during task solving. We use changes in task performance to determine which tokens are likely task-encoding tokens, as shown in Figure 1. The results indicate that template tokens and stopword tokens are most likely to be task-encoding because removing their representations significantly decreases performance. In contrast, content tokens have minimal impact on performance, indicating that they may not be essential for task encoding. We further examine each token in the template using the same ablation method, confirming that most of them are necessary for maintaining task performance. Beyond identifying task-encoding tokens, we explore how they differ from other types of tokens. We identify three distinguishing characteristics: the lexical meaning of tokens related to the task, the repetition of tokens throughout the prompt, and the text formatting they provide. Our research suggests that the lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting introduced by task-encoding tokens contribute to task performance across all model sizes. These characteristics should remain intact to avoid performance fluctuations, thus maintaining stability. Our work demonstrates that we can identify and characterize tokens whose representations are crucial for an LLM's performance on downstream tasks during the ICL process. We explore the characteristics of lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting related to task-encoding tokens, which help explain their presence and mitigate the instability they cause.

Most template tokens have representations necessary for maintaining task performance. Beyond identifying task-encoding tokens, we explore how they differ from other tokens. We find three distinguishing characteristics: lexical meaning related to the task, token repetition throughout the prompt, and text formatting provided by tokens. Our research indicates that these characteristics contribute to task performance across all model sizes. Disrupting them can cause performance fluctuations, so maintaining them is crucial for stability.\n\nOur work reveals that we can identify and characterize tokens with representations crucial for LLM performance on downstream tasks during ICL. We investigate lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting related to task-encoding tokens. This helps explain the presence of task-encoding tokens and avoid instability. Our findings deepen understanding of different token roles in LLMs. They suggest future work could leverage specific representations of different token types.

Furthermore, state-of-the-art computational language models operating within the distributional paradigm, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), are mainly trained on extant words. Yet, numerous insights into language learning have emerged from examining language beyond extant words, such as the grammatical errors and inference patterns that children exhibit when distinguishing extant words from non-linguistic auditory signals, including emotional expressions, auditory gestures, and other forms of paralinguistic speech (Yang, 2006; Carey, 2000). We propose that character n-grams, i.e., sequences of alphabetic characters, outside the space of extant language can provide new insights into the meaning of words and their representation by these models, beyond what is captured by word and subword-based distributional semantics alone. We explore this by studying the embeddings of randomly generated character n-grams, referred to as garble, which contain primitive communicative information but lack meaning, using the CharacterBERT model (El Boukkouri et al., 2020). Such randomly generated character n-grams are textual analogues of paralinguistic vocalizations\u2014vocal extra-speech sounds and noises. Our analyses contribute to the growing understanding of BERTology (Rogers et al., 2020) by identifying a dimension, which we refer to as the information axis, that separates extant and garble n-grams. This finding is supported by a Markov model that produces a probabilistic information measure for character n-grams based on their statistical properties. Strikingly, this information dimension correlates with properties of extant language; for example, parts of speech separate along the information axis, and word concreteness varies along a roughly orthogonal dimension in our projection of CharacterBERT embedding space. Although the information axis we identify separates extant and randomly generated n-grams very effectively, we demonstrate that these classes of n-grams mix into each other in detail, and that pseudowords\u2014i.e., phonologically coherent character n-grams without extant lexical meaning\u2014lie between the two in our CharacterBERT embeddings. This paper is organized as follows. We first discuss concepts from natural language processing, information theory, and linguistics relevant to our study. We then analyze CharacterBERT representations of extant and randomly generated character sequences and how the relation between the two informs the structure of extant language, including morphology, part-of-speech, and word concreteness. Finally, we ground our information axis in a predictive Markov language model.", "scores": {"ppl": 67.52334594726562, "some": 0.891376813252767, "bart": -0.47892531752586365, "acc": 0.5}}}
{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The drums are the most vital component of your beat, forming the backbone of the entire song. In hip-hop, rappers need a steady rhythm to rap over, so it's crucial to establish a strong foundation for melody, vocals, and orchestration. Start with the classic trio of drum beats: the kick drum for the deep thud, the snare for the sharp crack, and the hi-hat for the crisp sizzle. Experiment with these three drums to capture the lively, up-tempo feel of classic rap and hip-hop songs, using techniques like syncopation and ghost notes. Download free drum packs online to explore unique percussion sounds that can enhance your music. Experiment with other sounds for percussion, such as claps, shakers, or even unconventional items like glass bottles. Producers like J Dilla became famous for incorporating voices, sirens, pops, and other noises alongside traditional drums in tracks such as 'Waves.' Hip-hop has deep roots in jazz, funk, and soul, and like these genres, it relies heavily on two basic instruments: drums and bass. A bass line serves as the underlying structure for your song's melody. Bass lines can range from simple, as in Nas' 'Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),' to complex, like Common's 'Be (Intro).' Practice integrating the bass line with your kick drum so that the low-frequency notes complement each other. Layer them so that both the bass line and kick drum are clearly audible, as demonstrated in the mentioned songs. Once you've established the groove of the song with bass and drums, it's time to make it unique. This is your opportunity to shape the overall mood of the song. For an R&B-inspired track, consider adding piano, horns, and possibly some jazzy guitar, as heard in Blue Scholars' 'The Ave.' For a grand, cinematic sound, incorporate strings, tubas, gongs, and more, as in Big Boi's 'General Patton.' Constantly experiment with sounds\u2014the best way to discover what works is to try different orchestrations. Looping involves repeating several bars of music to create a seamless effect of continuous play throughout a song. It allows you to maintain a consistent beat for the MC to rap over and saves you from repeatedly writing out the same parts. The most effective loops are those that blend seamlessly into the track. Ideally, it should be indistinguishable that the section was essentially copied and pasted together. Sampling involves incorporating pieces of other songs into your track, using old elements to create something entirely new. Sampling is a core aspect of hip-hop production, but always proceed carefully\u2014sampling without permission can be illegal. Use samples sparingly, selecting 2-3 notes you like, and alter, repeat, or chop them to create something new. Whether you rap yourself or have someone else do it, record the vocals for your song, adjusting the length, chorus placement, and any intros or outros as necessary. Use your production skills to seamlessly integrate the lyrics with the beat. For example, if the lyrics reference the police, it's common to add a siren sound to the song. When you encounter particularly powerful lines or rhythms, consider muting the beat to emphasize the rapper's performance, then bring it back in for a surprise effect. Develop the beat by starting the song with just drums and bass, adding an instrument with each verse, and breaking it down in the outro, as in Outkast's 'Slump.' Add subtle accents\u2014even barely audible sounds can enhance the depth of the song. Read your software manual to learn about EQ, effects, and quantization, and apply them as necessary. EQ, or equalization, involves adjusting the volume, frequency, and sound of individual parts so they blend smoothly together in the entire song. Effects can modify or alter the sound of an instrument to suit the mood of the song. They can create echoes, change tones, subtly adjust notes, and more. Effects are not permanent, so test them on every instrument. Quantization is the process of aligning hand-played notes or beats with the electronic grid. The best hip-hop producers carved their own paths, learning from the masters while innovating with their unique techniques.

Bacteria are the most common infectious agents. They can be transmitted via bodily fluids and food. They are single-celled microorganisms that use your body as a base to replicate. Viruses are pathogens that cannot survive outside a host. When a virus enters your body, it hijacks your cells to multiply and spread to neighboring cells. Fungi are simple, plant-like organisms that may take up residence in your body. Parasites are living organisms that hijack the host\u2019s body and use its resources to thrive. Antibiotics are medications that fight off bacterial infections. They work by disabling or killing bacterial cells, aiding your immune system in eliminating bacteria. Use topical antibiotic ointments for small wounds that are infected. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. Do not use antibiotic ointment for heavily bleeding wounds that are deep. Seek medical attention if you have a wound that does not stop bleeding. For systemic bacterial infections, visit your healthcare provider to determine if you should be taking oral antibiotics. It is important to understand that antibiotics cannot cure or treat viral infections, such as colds or the flu. Your doctor can diagnose bacterial versus viral infections and treat them appropriately. Take antibiotics only as directed. Taking antibiotics when you don\u2019t need them (such as when you have a viral infection) increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Some viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics, but some antiviral medications can be used for certain viruses. Some viral infections are treated with home remedies, such as rest and staying hydrated. Some drugs, known as antiviral or antiretroviral drugs, can combat certain viruses by inhibiting their ability to reproduce inside your cells. Some viral infections, like the common cold, only require symptomatic treatment to ensure comfort. Your immune system can fight off the virus as long as you are not immunocompromised and get enough rest and nutrients. Many viral illnesses can be prevented with vaccinations. Thus, you should keep your immunizations up to date. Some fungal infections can be treated with medications that help eliminate the fungi and clear the infection. However, there are numerous pathogenic fungi that cause infections, and only your doctor can diagnose them and prescribe proper treatments. Some fungal infections, such as foot fungus, may be treated with a topical ointment if the infection is on your skin. Very serious and threatening fungal infections are treated with oral medications or injections. Examples of pathogenic fungi include histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, which can be deadly. As the name implies, parasites are organisms that \"hijack\" your body\u2019s resources in order to live, grow, and multiply inside you. Parasites include a wide array of pathogenic agents, from worms to microscopic organisms. Many parasites, such as hookworm, can enter your body via contaminated food or water, while others, such as the parasite causing malaria, enter through compromised skin from a mosquito bite.

Put on an old shirt or drape an old towel over your shoulders. Coat your hairline and ear tips with petroleum jelly to protect your skin from bleach, then pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. Make sure that your hair is healthy because damaged hair can react unpredictably to bleach. For best results, deep condition it the night before you bleach it to strengthen and hydrate your hair. Purchase a good quality hair bleaching kit that contains bleach and developer, as using a high-quality kit ensures better and safer results. Prepare the bleach in a non-metal bowl according to the kit's instructions, as metal can react with the bleach and alter its effectiveness. If you are starting with light brown hair, try a 10 volume developer; the volume indicates the strength of the developer and how much it will lighten your hair. If your hair is medium brown, a 20 volume developer might work best for you; the volume number indicates the level of peroxide in the developer and its lightening ability. If you have dark brown or black hair, use 30 volume with care; it is very strong and can damage your hair if not used properly. Apply the bleach to dry hair with a tinting brush, starting from the ends. If you need to, divide your hair into 4 sections first, which makes the application process more manageable and ensures even coverage. Working quickly, use a tinting brush to apply the bleach all over your hair, starting from the ends and mid-lengths first, because bleach works faster on the roots due to the heat from your scalp. Then, go back through your hair, and apply the bleach to the roots, as applying bleach to the roots first can lead to uneven color. Never apply bleach starting from the roots because the heat from your scalp causes the bleach to process faster, leading to uneven color. How long this takes depends on how dark your hair was to begin with and what volume developer you are using, as well as the desired level of lightness. Look at your hair every 5 minutes; once it reaches a pale blond color, you are ready to wash it out, as checking progress helps prevent over-processing. Expect to wait anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, which is the typical time range for bleach to process. Never leave bleach in your hair for longer than 45 minutes, or you'll destroy your hair due to over-processing. Everyone's hair reacts differently to bleach because factors like hair texture, thickness, and previous treatments affect the outcome. Your friend's hair may bleach a lot slower than yours due to differences in hair porosity and natural color. Rinse the bleach out with cool water first, then apply some shampoo to your hair, as cool water helps close the hair cuticle and reduce damage. Lather your hair up, then rinse the shampoo out, which helps remove any remaining bleach residue. If you want to, you can apply conditioner, but it's best to wait until after the toner, as conditioning before toning can interfere with the toner's effectiveness. Allow your hair to air dry naturally, which minimizes heat damage and helps maintain moisture. It would be best to wait a full 24 hours before you do this, otherwise you'll end up over-processing your hair, which can lead to severe damage. Keep in mind that if you have dark brown or black hair, it would be nearly impossible to get it to a platinum blonde color; you will have to settle for darker unicorn hair because achieving such a light color requires multiple bleaching sessions, which can be damaging. If the initial bleaching process made your hair too dry, do not bleach it again to avoid further damage and breakage. Simply settle for darker unicorn hair, which refers to vibrant, colorful shades that are not as light as platinum. If your hair ended up with brassy tones, which are unwanted warm hues, you may need to tone it. Purchase a hair toner or purple toning shampoo, then apply it to your hair according to the instructions on the bottle, as proper application ensures the best results. Some need to be used on dry hair while others should be used on wet, so using the correct hair state is crucial for effectiveness. Some hair toners need to be mixed with a developer or white conditioner, and mixing correctly ensures the toner works as intended. Read the instructions to find out, as following the manufacturer's guidance is important for safety and efficacy. Most hair toners need to sit in your hair for 20 to 30 minutes, which is typically enough time for the toner to neutralize unwanted tones. Purple toning shampoos typically need to sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes to effectively reduce brassiness. If you have platinum or pale yellow hair, you do not need to tone it because the color is already light enough. While not absolutely necessary, this is highly recommended because toning enhances the color and reduces unwanted hues. Purchase a deep-conditioning mask meant for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair to restore moisture and elasticity. Apply it all over your hair, then tuck your hair under a shower cap to ensure even distribution and better absorption. Wait for the time recommended on the label, then rinse it out, as following instructions ensures the treatment works effectively.

Generally, hair toners are left in the hair for about 20 to 30 minutes, whereas purple toning shampoos usually need only 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nIn some cases, if your hair is already a pale yellow or platinum shade, toning might not be necessary, but it is highly recommended to achieve that perfect finish. To maintain the health of your newly bleached hair, consider using a deep-conditioning mask specifically designed for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair. Apply the mask generously all over your hair, then tuck your hair under a shower cap to allow the conditioner to penetrate deeply. Follow the time recommendations on the label, which can vary from as little as 5 minutes to as long as 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.\n\nRemember, achieving a dramatic change from dark brown or black hair to platinum blonde is nearly impossible in one session without significant damage. Be prepared to settle for a darker shade of unicorn hair if necessary. It's vital to prioritize the health of your hair, and if the initial bleaching process has left your hair too dry, avoid further bleaching. Regularly applying deep-conditioning treatments will help restore moisture and vitality to your hair, ensuring it remains strong and healthy despite the chemical processes it has undergone.\n\nThroughout this process, remember that everyone's hair reacts differently to bleach and other chemical treatments. What works for one person may not work for another. Be patient and attentive to your hair's needs, and don't rush through the steps. With careful preparation and thoughtful application, you can achieve beautiful results while keeping your hair in optimal condition.", "scores": {"ppl": 25.39124870300293, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.5522923469543457, "acc": 1.0}}}

Patients with AD experience progressive deterioration in cognitive domains like memory, executive functions, and language. These impairments become more severe as the disease progresses. Language impairments can occur before the clinical manifestation of AD. They are already evident in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), in both amnestic and non-amnestic variants (Petersen et al., 1999). Therefore, detecting language impairments early in MCI is critical. Early detection can lead to treatments that may slow symptom progression. Speech, language, and communication symptoms vary in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. This variation may depend on the specific brain areas affected, particularly in the left hemisphere. Symptom variation is especially evident in patients with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). It is a progressive neurological condition primarily affecting speech and language (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Mesulam, 1982, 2001). Patients with inferior frontal damage exhibit agrammatism and speech apraxia as primary symptoms. These patients are classified into the nonfluent/agrammatic PPA variant. Patients with temporal lobe damage have semantic impairments, such as naming impairments. These patients are classified into the semantic variant PPA (svPPA). Patients with temporal and parietal lobe damage show phonological errors, repetition, and naming deficits. These patients are classified into the logopenic variant PPA. Assessing language function early can inform clinical decisions concerning remediation and compensation for language abilities.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Natural language processing (NLP) is experiencing explosive growth in applications and public visibility, with large language models (LLMs) being deployed in many real-life applications. However, the widespread use of these models, as noted by Min et al. (2023), brings important concerns such as frequent hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023). Models are often poorly calibrated (Vasudevan et al., 2019; Desai and Durrett, 2020), and evaluation is limited, sometimes affected by data contamination (Sainz et al., 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2024). Explanations are often unreliable (Zhao et al., 2024; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019), and models frequently exhibit undesired biases (Gallegos et al., 2024). Reliable uncertainty quantification is key to addressing some of these concerns: NLP systems should not only provide accurate answers but also \u201cknow when they do not know.\u201d Unfortunately, most NLP systems return only single predictions without reliable confidence information, and systems that quantify uncertainty are much less common. These systems often make incorrect distribution-based assumptions, ignoring the complex nature of the underlying data and model (Xiao and Wang, 2019; He et al., 2020; Glushkova et al., 2021; Zerva et al., 2022), and are frequently poorly calibrated (i.e., they predict a confidence level that does not match its error probability; Kuleshov et al. 2018). Moreover, they may be computationally too demanding, rendering them inapplicable to large-scale models (Hu et al., 2023). Conformal prediction (CP; Vovk et al. 2005) has emerged as a promising candidate to bypass these issues. Unlike other uncertainty quantification frameworks, it offers statistical guarantees of ground-truth coverage with minimal assumptions. CP methods are model-agnostic and distribution-free, assuming only data exchangeability, and extensions for non-exchangeable data have been proposed (Gibbs and Candes, 2021; Barber et al., 2023). Popular CP variants are efficient, not requiring model retraining and usable online or offline with a small calibration set. Equalized variants of CP (Romano et al., 2020) can reduce biases and unfairness by distributing coverage evenly across protected attributes. The flexibility and strong statistical guarantees of CP have attracted considerable interest, leading to an increase in publications in computer science. This survey focuses on conformal methods for NLP, highlighting their theory, guarantees, and potential to solve significant problems in the field.

However, the widespread adoption of these models raises significant concerns: hallucinations are common (Ji et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023), models often exhibit poor calibration (Vasudevan et al., 2019; Desai and Durrett, 2020), and evaluation is sometimes limited or compromised by data contamination (Sainz et al., 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2024). Additionally, explanations provided by these models can be unreliable (Zhao et al., 2024; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019), and there is a prevalence of unwanted biases (Gallegos et al., 2024). Addressing these issues requires reliable uncertainty quantification, enabling NLP systems to not only provide accurate answers but also recognize when they lack knowledge. Unfortunately, most NLP systems offer only single predictions without reliable confidence information. Systems capable of quantifying uncertainty are rare and often limited; they may rely on incorrect distribution-based assumptions, disregarding the complex nature of the underlying data and model (Xiao and Wang, 2019; He et al., 2020; Glushkova et al., 2021; Zerva et al., 2022), or they might be poorly calibrated (Kuleshov et al., 2018) and computationally prohibitive for large-scale models (Hu et al., 2023). Conformal prediction (CP; Vovk et al., 2005) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome these challenges. Unlike other uncertainty quantification frameworks, CP provides statistical guarantees of ground-truth coverage with minimal assumptions. It is model-agnostic and distribution-free, assuming only data exchangeability (\u00a72.3). Recently, extensions of CP for non-exchangeable data have been proposed (Gibbs and Candes, 2021; Barber et al., 2023). Popular CP variants are efficient, not requiring model retraining, and are usable both online and offline with a relatively small calibration set. Equalized CP variants (Romano et al., 2020) can also mitigate biases by distributing coverage evenly across protected attributes. The flexibility and robust statistical guarantees of CP have drawn significant interest, leading to a rising number of publications in computer science. Thus, it is timely to present a survey of conformal methods for NLP, exploring the theory and guarantees behind these methods and identifying opportunities and challenges they present. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of CP techniques for NLP tasks, detailing CP and its relevant extensions (\u00a72 and \u00a73), reviewing its applications in NLP (\u00a74), and exploring future research directions and open issues in using CP for NLP (\u00a75).

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Often, dog owners choose a breed of dog that looks a lot like them. When considering which breed of dog you want to dress as for cosplay, matching your look to the breed might be a good place to start. If you already have the look of a certain breed, it will be a head start on your costume. If you have curly hair, you may want to try a Cocker Spaniel or a Poodle. People with straight hair can pull off the look of shiny, short-haired dogs like Dobermans and Dalmatians. Thin people could dress as Greyhounds or Whippets. For a tough, strong look, try a Bulldog or Pitbull. Cosplay costumes are different from your average Halloween costume in that you don\u2019t want to cover yourself in a big dog outfit. Instead, you want to highlight that you, yourself, are the dog. Wear shorts or leggings and a shirt in the color of your breed. You could even choose a full, short skirt or tutu if you are dressing as a poodle or another fun, fluffy dog like a Pomeranian. Add little elements to your outfit to suggest you are a dog. Try tufts of fur on the shoulders, or spots on your shirt. A popular option for getting an animal look is a Spirit Hood. These are large, furry hats with long sides that drape down and end in mittens with paw prints on the underside. This is a great start to a dog costume. You can also find dog ears on a headband or make your own by gluing felt to a headband. If your hair is long enough to put in pigtails, you can make ears out of your own hair. You will want to focus on painting the nose and mouth of a dog by tracing around the tip of your nose in black, brown, or pink paint, depending on your breed. Also, create the dog muzzle between your nose and upper lip using a lighter color. You can add some whiskers here. For a playful look, paint a red or pink tongue over one side of your bottom lip and extend it past to look like your tongue is hanging out. Outline the tongue with a thin black line. People dressing as spotted dogs can paint a big spot around one eye. If you have a Spirit Hood, your front paws are already covered. If not, it is simple enough to use a pair of mittens, which you can wear on their own or decorate with furry material or felt. Boots are very common in cosplay. Find a pair of boots that matches the look of your breed. Choose a nice, sleek, tall boot for a short-haired dog. Find a fluffy boot, like furry Uggs, for a long-haired look. No dog costume is complete without a tail. Depending on the breed you choose, you may want a thin tail or a fluffy tail. You can achieve these looks using felt or yarn in the appropriate colors. For a fluffy tail, cut 10 pieces of yarn, each 5 inches long, and tie them together in the middle to make a tassel. Make several of these tassels. Using the string tied around the middle of the tassel, tie these tassels to a longer string that is slightly longer than the length of the tail. Tie this to a belt or use more yarn to wrap around your waist and tie the tail on. You can make a tail out of felt or another material of your choice. Cut the material five inches wide and the length you would like for your tail. Roll the material starting with the end of the tail, which should come together at a point, ending at the top, which should be left open. Sew the edges together to create a long cone shape. Stuff the tail with cotton stuffing and place a flexible wire in the center if you would like to be able to adjust the shape of the tail. Sew the top together and sew an additional loop to the top to thread a belt through. The accessories are what will really give your costume personality. Think of different accessories and props you can add to your costume. You probably want a collar or at least a necklace of some kind. Wear dog tags and have your name engraved on the tag at the pet store. Alternatively, you might want to get creative and use a bow tie as a collar to class up your dog costume. Some props you can consider would be a big stick or a dog bone.

Those with straight hair can easily pull off the look of sleek, short-haired dogs like Dobermans or Dalmatians. Slender individuals could dress as Greyhounds or Whippets, capturing their elegant and streamlined appearance. For a more robust and strong look, breeds like Bulldogs or Pitbulls might be more fitting.\n\nCosplay costumes differ significantly from your typical Halloween attire. The goal is not to obscure yourself in a cumbersome dog suit. Instead, the emphasis is on highlighting that you, in essence, are the dog. Start with shorts or leggings paired with a shirt in the color scheme of your chosen breed. You could even opt for a full, short skirt or a tutu if you're embodying a Poodle or any other playful, fluffy dog like a Pomeranian.\n\nLittle details can elevate your costume, suggesting the characteristics of a dog. Consider adding tufts of fur on the shoulders or spots on your shirt. A popular accessory for achieving an animalistic look is a Spirit Hood. These are oversized, furry hats with elongated sides that drape down and end in mittens, complete with paw prints on the underside. It's an excellent base for a dog costume. Additionally, you can find dog ears on a headband or craft your own by attaching felt to a headband. If your hair is long enough, creating ears out of your own hair by forming pigtails is a creative option.\n\nWhen it comes to makeup, focus on painting the nose and mouth to mimic that of a dog. Trace around the tip of your nose with black, brown, or pink paint, depending on your breed. To create the dog\u2019s muzzle, use a lighter color between your nose and upper lip, and add some whiskers for authenticity. For a playful effect, paint a red or pink tongue over one side of your bottom lip, extending it past the lip to give the illusion of a tongue hanging out. Outline this tongue with a thin black line for definition. Spotted dogs can enhance their look by painting a large spot around one eye. \n\nIf you're wearing a Spirit Hood, your front paws are already covered. If not, a simple pair of mittens can be transformed to fit your costume, either worn as is or decorated with furry material or felt. Boots are a staple in cosplay.

In such cases, it's better to be proactive and let your neighbors know ahead of time that you'll need a bit more quiet than normal. For example, in the days before your important event or schedule change, you might consider stopping by your neighbor's place with a plate of homemade cookies and trying the following approach: \u201cHey Sam, I've got final exams all next week, and will need extra quiet time.

If you don't know your neighbors at all or if your schedules don't align to where you ever see them outside of their home (at the mailbox, in the driveway, etc.), then leaving them a very politely worded note in their mailbox or on their door could be an effective way to alert them to the problem. Make sure that your note explains specifically what the issue is: For example, let them know that you can hear their television at 11pm when you are trying to get to sleep, and note that it is loud enough for you to hear all of the dialogue on the program. Be sure to offer a proposed solution in your note: For example, suggest that they reduce the volume by a third, or ask that they move the television to the opposite side of the room, away from your shared wall. In case the situation is not resolved, you should keep a dated copy of the note for your records. Keep in mind that just because you can hear your neighbors, this doesn't automatically mean that they are being too noisy and that you would be justified in asking them to quiet down. Remember that people do have the right to make noise in their own home. Of course, what one person finds mildly annoying the next will find unbearable\u2014these are somewhat subjective terms. In your effort to decide if you really ought to confront your neighbors, ask yourself whether their noise is significantly interfering with your ability to sleep, work, listen to your own programs, etc. If so, then a conversation probably is called for.

Cutting the tongue can be a painful and frightening experience, so it's important to help the injured person relax. Keeping both yourself and the injured calm will help as you treat the injury. Before helping anyone with a cut, wash your hands thoroughly to minimize the risk of infection. You may also want to use medical gloves when assisting the victim, as blood can carry diseases. Sit the person up straight and tilt their head forward to allow the blood to flow out of the mouth rather than down the throat. Swallowing blood can cause vomiting, so sitting up with the head tilted forward helps prevent this. A tongue cut will likely bleed a lot, but it's important to assess the depth and size of the injury. If the cut is shallow, you can proceed with home treatment. If the wound is deep or longer than half an inch, seek medical attention. If the tongue is punctured, it may require professional care to avoid complications. If you suspect foreign material in the wound, see a doctor. Use gauze or a clean cloth to apply steady pressure to the injury for about fifteen minutes. This helps stop the bleeding. If blood soaks through the cloth or gauze, apply more without removing the original piece. Wrap an ice cube in a clean, thin cloth. Hold this against the wound to reduce blood flow and prevent pain and swelling. Hold the ice bundle directly on the wound for no more than three minutes at a time. This can be done up to ten times a day. You may also suck on an ice cube or hold one in your mouth. To make ice application more enjoyable, try using a popsicle.

This can be done up to six times a day. Rinsing your mouth helps keep the wound clean. If your teeth are not injured, continue with your regular dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth. Ensure there are no injuries to your teeth before brushing or flossing. Do not brush or floss injured or broken teeth. If you have a dental injury, see a dentist as soon as possible. As the injury heals, monitor its progress closely. Look for signs that it may not be healing correctly or if another issue is arising.

Purchase a good quality hair bleaching kit that contains bleach and developer. Prepare the bleach in a non-metallic bowl according to the kit's instructions. If you are starting with light brown hair, try a 10 volume developer. If your hair is medium brown, a 20 volume developer might work best for you. If you have dark brown or black hair, use a 30 volume developer with care, as it is very strong. Apply bleach to dry hair using a tinting brush, beginning with the ends. Divide your hair into four parts if you prefer, but it isn't mandatory. Use a tinting brush to apply the bleach quickly all over your hair, starting with the ends and mid-lengths, then apply it to the roots afterward. Never start bleach application at the roots, as doing so can cause the bleach to process too quickly and damage your hair. The time it takes depends on your hair's original darkness and the volume of developer used. Check your hair every 5 minutes; when it turns pale blond, it's time to rinse it out. Expect the process to take between 30 and 45 minutes. Never leave bleach in your hair for more than 45 minutes, or it will damage your hair. Everyone's hair responds differently to bleach; for example, your friend's hair might bleach more slowly than yours. First, rinse the bleach out with cool water, then shampoo your hair. Lather your hair and then rinse out the shampoo. You can apply conditioner if you wish, but it's best to do so after toning. Let your hair air dry naturally. It's best to wait a full 24 hours before applying any additional treatments to avoid over-processing your hair.

Start by covering your countertop and the floor with newspaper or plastic bags to catch any spills or drips. This precaution will save you from a messy cleanup later. Make sure to wear an old shirt that you don't mind staining, or protect your clothing by draping an old towel over your shoulders. To safeguard your skin, apply a layer of petroleum jelly along your hairline and on the tips of your ears. This acts as a barrier and prevents the bleach from coming into direct contact with your skin. Also, don't forget to wear a pair of plastic dyeing gloves to protect your hands throughout the process.\n\nThe health of your hair is crucial when it comes to bleaching, as the process can be quite harsh. To achieve the best results, deep condition your hair the night before you plan to bleach it. This will enhance your hair's resilience and help it withstand the bleaching process without becoming too damaged. When you are ready, purchase a high-quality hair bleaching kit that includes both bleach and developer. The choice of developer is important and should be based on your current hair color. For those with light brown hair, a 10 volume developer is often sufficient. If your hair is medium brown, a 20 volume developer might be more suitable. However, if you have dark brown or black hair, a 30 volume developer can be used, but with caution due to its strength.\n\nOnce you have your kit ready, follow the instructions to prepare the bleach in a non-metal bowl. It is important to use a non-metal container as metal can react with the bleach and affect the outcome. Begin applying the bleach to dry hair using a tinting brush, starting from the ends and working towards the mid-lengths. If necessary, divide your hair into four sections to make the application more manageable. Remember to work quickly, as the bleach will start processing as soon as it is applied. It is crucial to apply the bleach to the roots last, as they process faster than the rest of the hair due to the heat from your scalp. Starting with the roots can lead to uneven coloring and potentially damage the hair.\n\nThe amount of time you leave the bleach on your hair depends on both the initial color of your hair and the volume of developer you are using. Check your hair every five minutes to monitor the lightening process. Once your hair reaches a pale blond color, it is time to rinse out the bleach. This usually takes between 30 to 45 minutes, but never leave bleach in your hair for longer than 45 minutes, as this can cause severe damage.\n\nAfter the bleaching process, rinse your hair thoroughly with cool water, then follow up with shampoo to remove any remaining bleach. Although you might be tempted to apply conditioner right away, it is advisable to wait until after you have toned your hair. Allow your hair to air dry naturally, and if possible, wait a full 24 hours before proceeding to the next step. This waiting period helps prevent over-processing, which can lead to further damage.\n\nFor those with dark brown or black hair, achieving a platinum blonde color might be challenging or impossible without causing significant damage. In such cases, be prepared to accept a darker shade, often referred to as \"unicorn hair.\" If the initial bleaching process leaves your hair too dry, refrain from bleaching it again. Instead, embrace the darker shade to maintain your hair's health. \n\nIf you find that your hair has developed brassy tones, consider using a hair toner or purple toning shampoo. These products can neutralize unwanted tones and enhance the overall color. Follow the instructions on the product packaging carefully, as some toners are meant to be applied to dry hair, while others are intended for wet hair. Additionally, some toners need to be mixed with a developer or white conditioner, so it is important to read the instructions thoroughly. Generally, hair toners should be left in the hair for 20 to 30 minutes, whereas purple toning shampoos usually require only 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nIf your hair has reached a platinum or pale yellow shade, toning might not be necessary. However, it is highly recommended for achieving the best color results. After toning, or if you choose to skip this step, consider applying a deep-conditioning mask designed for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair. This will help restore moisture and strengthen your hair after the bleaching process. Apply the mask evenly throughout your hair, then cover your hair with a shower cap. Leave the mask on for the duration recommended on the product label, which can vary from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the specific conditioner.\n\nBy following these steps carefully and taking proper precautions, you can achieve a beautiful bleached hair color while minimizing damage and maintaining the health of your hair.", "scores": {"ppl": 22.82427978515625, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -2.409353733062744, "acc": 1.0}}}

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Objectives and goals are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably. However, there is a distinct difference between educational objectives and educational goals; goals are broad and often difficult to measure objectively. In a college class on child psychology, a goal might be for students to appreciate the need for clinical training when dealing with small children; educational objectives, however, are much more specific. For example, 'By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify three theorists whose work on child psychology influenced teaching practices in the US and explain their contributions, with an emphasis on understanding how these theories can be applied in practical settings.' In 1956, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom created a framework to classify different types of learning and illustrate a hierarchy of learning levels. Bloom's Taxonomy is usually used when writing educational objectives, and Bloom identified three domains of learning, with the cognitive domain given the most focus in higher education. The first level is knowledge, which is the ability to memorize, recite, and recall previously learned materials, while the next level is comprehension, which involves taking the facts you know and demonstrating your understanding. The third level is application. This means solving problems by applying your knowledge to various situations, such as using learned concepts in different contexts. The fourth level is analysis. This means taking the facts you learned and reexamining them to understand why they are true and to support new claims or inferences you make during your education. The fifth level is synthesis, which involves organizing information in a new way, and the sixth level is evaluation, which involves gaining the ability to present and defend information and make informed judgments, such as analyzing whether Hamlet truly loved Ophelia. When writing an educational objective, there are three characteristics that you need to focus on. These characteristics help you effectively communicate the intent of your class. Performance is the first characteristic, and an objective should always state what your students are expected to be able to do by the end of a unit or class, while condition is the second characteristic, and a good educational objective will outline the conditions under which a student is supposed to perform said task. Criterion, the third characteristic, outlines how well a student must perform, specifying the expectations for acceptable performance. For example, say you are teaching a nursing class. A good educational objective would be 'By the end of this course, students will be able to draw blood in typical hospital settings within a 2 to 3-minute timeframe, ensuring patient comfort and accuracy.'", "scores": {"ppl": 36.35438537597656, "some": 0.8902745246887207, "bart": -1.185009241104126, "acc": 0.5}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Objectives and goals are often confused, but they differ significantly in education.

Educational objectives are precise, using measurable verbs and criteria for proficiency in a subject. For example, \"By the end of this unit, students will identify three theorists whose work influenced US teaching practices.\" This is a specific objective for the same course.\n\nIn 1956, Benjamin Bloom developed a framework to classify learning types and a hierarchy of learning levels, known as Bloom's Taxonomy. This taxonomy is often used to write educational objectives. Bloom identified three learning domains, with the cognitive domain being most emphasized in higher education. The cognitive domain, used for writing objectives, focuses on intellectual learning and has six levels.\n\nThe first level is knowledge, involving memorization and recall of learned materials. Examples include memorizing multiplication tables or recalling the Battle of Hastings date. The second level is comprehension, which involves organizing, interpreting, translating, or comparing facts to demonstrate understanding. Examples include translating a Japanese sentence into German or explaining nuclear technology's impact on Reagan's policies.\n\nThe third level is application, which involves solving problems by applying knowledge to various situations. Examples include using pi in math problems or using \"please\" politely with others. The fourth level is analysis, which involves reexamining facts to understand their truth and finding evidence to support new claims. Examples include understanding \"fate\" as predetermined destiny or analyzing what happens when objects are thrown into water.\n\nThe fifth level is synthesis, which involves organizing information in new ways and discovering new patterns or ideas. Examples include creating a painting or proposing a new theory about subatomic particles. The sixth level is evaluation, which involves defending information and making informed judgments about others' opinions. Examples include creating a film about immigrants or writing an essay on Hamlet's love for Ophelia.\n\nWhen writing an educational objective, focus on three characteristics: performance, condition, and criterion. Performance states what students should do by the end of a unit. Condition outlines the circumstances under which the task is performed.

The fever often fluctuates unpredictably as malaria parasites periodically enter the bloodstream from the liver. Among the five types of Plasmodium parasites that can infect humans, P. falciparum, mainly found in Africa, and P. vivax, primarily in Latin America and Asia, are the most common and dangerous. The initial symptoms, including fever, may be mild and can resemble less severe viral infections like the common cold or flu. Symptoms typically appear about two weeks after a mosquito bite. Another major symptom of malaria is severe shaking chills with intermittent sweating, which are more intense than those of other infections. These chills can cause teeth to chatter, disrupt sleep, and are sometimes mistaken for seizures. Malaria-induced chills are usually not alleviated by blankets or warmer clothing. Although the primary symptoms of malaria generally appear a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito, some malarial parasites can remain dormant in the body for up to a year or more. Bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes usually appear as small, red, itchy bumps, which are less noticeable compared to bites from other insects and spiders that can be more prominent and painful. Other secondary symptoms of malaria, such as vomiting and diarrhea, can occur multiple times per day, typically following the primary symptoms. Malaria symptoms are triggered by bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasites into the bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver, where they remain dormant for about a week before causing symptoms. Potential complications include kidney failure, liver failure, shock from very low blood pressure, and an enlarged spleen. The pain is often most pronounced in larger and more active muscles, such as those in the legs and back, which receive more infected blood. Other secondary symptoms of malaria, such as vomiting and diarrhea, can occur multiple times per day, usually following the primary symptoms. The key difference is that vomiting and diarrhea caused by food poisoning usually subside within a few days, whereas in malaria, they can persist for several weeks, depending on treatment. Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea seen in some bacterial infections, such as those caused by Shigella, malaria typically does not involve blood or severe cramps. If the infected person does not seek medical attention and treatment for the progressing primary and secondary symptoms, which may not be feasible in developing regions, more severe symptoms indicating significant bodily injury or damage may begin to emerge. When these advanced symptoms of malaria appear, the risk of health complications and death increases significantly. Confusion, multiple convulsions, coma, and neurological impairment indicate brain swelling and injury. Severe anemia, abnormal bleeding, deep labored breathing, and respiratory distress indicate advanced blood infection and lung involvement.

It can appear as early as seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, although it usually emerges between 10 to 15 days post-bite. The fever often presents in a sporadic manner, coming and going at seemingly random intervals. This intermittent fever is believed to be linked to the malaria parasites transiently spreading into the bloodstream from the liver.\n\nThere are at least five types of Plasmodium parasites that can infect humans. Among these, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the most prevalent and deadly, with P. falciparum mainly found in Africa and P. vivax primarily in Latin America and Asia.

Unlike chills from other causes, those induced by malaria are not alleviated by wrapping in blankets or donning warmer clothes.\n\nAlthough the primary symptoms of malaria generally begin within a few weeks of the mosquito bite, some types of malarial parasites can remain dormant in the body for up to a year or longer. Malaria symptoms are triggered by bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasites directly into the host's bloodstream. These parasites then travel to the liver, where they lie dormant for a week or two before causing symptoms.\n\nSecondary symptoms of malaria include moderate-to-severe headaches and mild muscle aches. These secondary symptoms typically emerge shortly after the primary symptoms, as the parasites need additional time to proliferate in the liver and spread throughout the bloodstream. Headaches and muscle aches are also common with many other infections, as well as from bites of other insects and spiders.\n\nThe bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes are generally not very noticeable, resulting in only a small, red, itchy bump. This is in contrast to bites from other insects and spiders, which can cause more pronounced symptoms. The initial headaches associated with malaria are typically dull, resembling tension headaches. However, as the parasites begin to infect and destroy red blood cells, these headaches can become more intense, resembling migraines. The achy pain is usually most prominent in the leg and back muscles, which are larger, more active, and receive more of the infected blood.\n\nOther non-specific secondary symptoms of malaria include frequent vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms often occur together, mimicking the initial symptoms of food poisoning and other bacterial infections.

Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea seen in some bacterial infections, such as those caused by Shigella, malaria-induced diarrhea usually lacks blood and severe cramping.\n\nOnce the primary and secondary symptoms become noticeable, the malaria-causing parasites can be detected under a microscope in a drop of infected blood, especially if the specimen is stained with Giemsa stain. If the primary and secondary symptoms do not prompt the infected individual to seek medical attention and treatment, more severe symptoms may develop, indicating serious injury or damage to the body.\n\nAdvanced symptoms of malaria significantly increase the risk of health complications and death.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Bilingual data (including bilingual sentences and bilingual terms) are critical resources for building many applications, such as machine translation (Brown, 1993) and cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999). However, many existing bilingual data sets fall short of their intended uses, are outdated, and are limited to specific domains, often lacking comprehensive coverage and restricting their applicability in broader contexts. Creating a large-scale bilingual dataset manually is challenging and costly; therefore, researchers have turned to automatically mining them from the web, leveraging the vast availability of multilingual content and advancements in data extraction technologies, making it a more cost-effective and scalable solution. If a web page contains content in two languages, it is referred to as a Bilingual Web Page; for instance, a page with product descriptions in both English and Spanish serves as a practical example. Many such pages appear on non-English websites, especially on platforms with a global audience or where the primary user base speaks multiple languages, reflecting users' diverse linguistic needs. On most of these pages, a primary language (usually non-English) is more prominently presented, with English as a supplementary language, supporting bilingual communication. The content in the secondary language often translates some primary language text on the page, aiming to reach a broader audience or ensure understanding by non-native speakers, thus facilitating effective communication across language barriers. Given the prevalence of bilingual web pages on non-English sites, mining bilingual data from them is crucial, as it can substantially enhance the quality and breadth of language resources for various applications, enriching multilingual datasets. However, to our knowledge, there is no publication on directly mining bilingual sentences from bilingual web pages, which highlights a research gap that could be pivotal for improving multilingual data accessibility and resource development. Most existing methods for mining bilingual sentences from the web, such as those by Nie et al. (1999), Resnik and Smith (2003), and Shi et al. (2006), initially mine parallel web documents within bilingual websites and then extract bilingual sentences using sentence alignment methods, which can be time-consuming and less efficient due to document alignment complexity. For mining term translations from bilingual web pages, Cao et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2008) proposed methods to extract term translations based on the observation that authors of many bilingual web pages, especially those primarily in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, sometimes annotate terms with their English translations in parentheses, such as \u201cc1c2...cn(e1 e2...em)\u201d (where c1c2...cn is a primary language term and e1 e2...em is its English translation), facilitating the identification of equivalent terms across languages by leveraging common text patterns. Beyond the parenthesis pattern, another notable phenomenon is that bilingual data often appear collectively on many bilingual web pages, following similar surface patterns, which simplifies the identification of translation pairs and streamlines data extraction. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from a page introducing different dog breeds, illustrating the structured presentation of bilingual names and offering insight into how language data can be systematically organized. The page provides a list of dog names in both English and Chinese, aiming to offer easy cross-reference for readers familiar with either language, thereby serving as a helpful resource for bilingual users. Note that those bilingual names do not follow the parenthesis pattern but are instead presented in a straightforward list format. However, most of them are formatted consistently as: \u201c{Number}\u3002{English name}{Chinese name}{EndOfLine}\u201d, with the English name directly followed by the Chinese name, ensuring clarity and consistency in presentation. One exceptional pair (\u201c1. Alaskan Malamute \u554a\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u96ea\u6a47\u72ac\u201d) differs only slightly, demonstrating minor inconsistencies due to formatting choices or typographical errors, highlighting the challenges in maintaining uniformity. Furthermore, many pages contain consistently formatted bilingual sentences (see Figure 2), providing a structured dataset for language study and offering a systematic approach to language learning. The page lists the (claimed) 200 most common oral sentences in English with their Chinese translations to facilitate English learning, serving as a resource for language learners to practice and improve their conversational skills, thereby enhancing their proficiency. People create such web pages for various reasons, including reaching a broader audience or providing educational resources, fulfilling both commercial and educational purposes. Some online stores list their products in two languages to make them understandable to foreigners, enabling them to cater to international customers and enhance sales potential by making their offerings accessible to a wider market. Some pages aim to help readers with foreign language learning by providing direct translations and explanations to aid comprehension and retention, supporting the educational goals of language learners. In some pages where foreign names or technical terms are mentioned, authors provide translations for disambiguation, ensuring clarity and reducing misunderstandings for readers unfamiliar with the original terms, thus enhancing communication effectiveness. For easy reference, from now on, we will call pages containing many consistently formatted translation pairs Collective Bilingual Pages, reflecting their utility in systematically presenting language pairs for easy extraction and analysis, crucial for efficient data processing. According to our estimation, at least tens of millions of collective bilingual pages exist on Chinese websites, indicating vast data mining potential in this area, suggesting a significant untapped resource for language technology development. Most importantly, each page typically contains a large amount of bilingual data, offering a rich source of information for various computational and linguistic applications, hence contributing valuable insights. This demonstrates the great potential of bilingual data mining to expand language resources, improve machine learning models, and enhance multilingual communication, thereby advancing language technology. However, the mining task is not straightforward for the following reasons: patterns vary across pages, making it impossible to mine translation pairs using predefined templates; some pages contain consistently formatted texts in two languages, but they are not translation pairs; and not all translations in a collective bilingual page necessarily follow an exactly consistent format, complicating the design of a one-size-fits-all approach and necessitating flexible and adaptive methods. As shown in Figure 1, the ten translation pairs are supposed to follow the same pattern; however, due to typos, the pattern of the first pair is slightly different, illustrating the variability and potential errors in real-world data that can complicate data extraction efforts. Due to these difficulties, simply using a classifier to extract translation pairs from adjacent bilingual texts in a collective bilingual page may not yield satisfactory results, as it might miss unique formats or misinterpret non-translation text, underscoring the need for sophisticated extraction techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a pattern-based approach: adaptively learning patterns from collective bilingual pages instead of using the parenthesis pattern, then using these learned patterns to extract translation pairs from corresponding web pages, allowing for more flexibility and accuracy in handling diverse data structures, thereby improving the robustness of the extraction process. Specifically, our approach consists of four steps: preprocessing, seed mining, pattern learning, and pattern-based mining. Each step is designed to incrementally build a comprehensive extraction framework, ensuring a thorough analysis and extraction of bilingual data. The preprocessing step involves parsing the web page into a DOM tree and segmenting each node's inner text into snippets, preparing the data for further analysis by structuring it for efficient processing. Seed mining identifies potential translation pairs (seeds) using an alignment model that considers both translation and transliteration, ensuring that both direct translations and phonetically similar terms are captured, broadening the scope of extraction. In pattern learning, we generalize patterns with the identified seeds, creating templates that can be applied to new data, enhancing the method's adaptability. Finally, pattern-based mining extracts all bilingual data on the page using the learned patterns, effectively identifying translation pairs across various formats, ensuring comprehensive and accurate data extraction. Let us take the mining of bilingual data from the text shown in Figure 1 as an example. Our method identifies \u201cBoxer \u62f3\u5e08\u201d and \u201cEskimo Dog \u7231\u65af\u57fa\u6469\u72ac\u201d as two potential translation pairs based on a dictionary and a transliteration model (Step 2 above), demonstrating its capability to accurately recognize and align text, thereby validating the approach's effectiveness. Then, we learn a generalized pattern that both pairs follow as \u201c{BulletNumber}{Punctuation}{English term}{Chinese term}{EndOfLine}\u201d, (Step 3 above), which can be applied to similar data structures. Finally, we apply it to match the entire text and retrieve all translation pairs following the pattern (Step 4 above), ensuring comprehensive extraction and maximizing the efficiency of the process. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we list some related work, providing a foundation and context for our research, situating our study within the broader academic discourse. The overview of our mining approach is presented in Section 3, detailing the methodology and its potential applications, thereby offering a clear framework for implementation.

However, most existing bilingual datasets face significant challenges: they are often inadequate for intended purposes, not up-to-date, and limited to specific domains. The creation of large-scale bilingual datasets with human effort is both difficult and costly, prompting many researchers to explore automatic mining from the web.\n\nWeb pages containing text in two languages are referred to as Bilingual Web Pages. These pages are prevalent across various non-English websites. Typically, a primary language is used, often a non-English language, with English serving as the secondary language. The content in the secondary language frequently translates portions of the text in the primary language.\n\nGiven the prevalence of bilingual web pages in non-English sites, extracting bilingual data from them is a crucial task. However, to our knowledge, there is no existing publication that directly addresses mining bilingual sentences from bilingual web pages. Most current methods, as mentioned in studies like Nie et al. (1999), Resnik and Smith (2003), and Shi et al. (2006), focus on mining parallel web documents within bilingual sites before using sentence alignment techniques to extract bilingual sentences.\n\nRegarding the extraction of term translations from bilingual web pages, Cao et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2008) have proposed methods that capitalize on the observation that many bilingual web pages, particularly those with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean as the primary language, often annotate terms with their English translations within parentheses, such as \u201cc1c2...cn(e1 e2...em)\u201d where c1c2...cn is a primary language term and e1 e2...em is its English translation. Beyond this parenthesis pattern, another notable phenomenon is that bilingual data often appears collectively and follows similar surface patterns on many bilingual web pages. Figure 1 provides an excerpt from a page that introduces various dog breeds, listing their names in both English and Chinese. Although these bilingual names do not adhere to the parenthesis pattern, they share a common format: \u201c{Number}\u3002{English name}{Chinese name}{EndOfLine}\u201d. An exception is \u201c1.Alaskan Malamute \u554a\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u96ea\u6a47\u72ac\u201d, which deviates slightly. Additionally, many pages feature consistently formatted bilingual sentences, as demonstrated in Figure 2, where the page lists the (claimed) 200 most common oral sentences in English with their Chinese translations to aid English learning.\n\nThe creation of such bilingual web pages serves multiple purposes. Some online stores offer product listings in two languages to cater to international customers. Other pages are designed to assist readers in learning foreign languages. Additionally, when foreign names or technical terms appear, translations are provided for clarity. For simplicity, we will refer to pages containing numerous consistently formatted translation pairs as Collective Bilingual Pages.\n\nOur estimation suggests that at least tens of millions of collective bilingual pages exist on Chinese websites. Crucially, each page typically contains a substantial amount of bilingual data, indicating the significant potential of bilingual data mining. However, the mining process is not straightforward due to several challenges:\n1) The patterns vary across different pages, making it impossible to mine translation pairs using predefined templates.\n2) Some pages feature consistently formatted text in two languages, but they are not translation pairs.\n3) Not all translations on a collective bilingual page strictly adhere to a consistent format. As seen in Figure 1, while ten translation pairs are expected to follow the same pattern, typos result in slight variations, such as the first pair deviating slightly.\n\nDue to these complexities, employing a simple classifier to extract translation pairs from adjacent bilingual texts on a collective bilingual page may not yield satisfactory results. Therefore, we propose a pattern-based approach: instead of relying on the parenthesis pattern, we focus on adaptively learning patterns from collective bilingual pages and using these learned patterns to extract translation pairs from corresponding web pages. Our approach comprises four steps:\n1) Preprocessing: Parse the web page into a DOM tree and segment the inner text of each node into snippets.\n2) Seed mining: Identify potential translation pairs (seeds) using an alignment model that considers both translation and transliteration.\n3) Pattern learning: Develop generalized patterns based on the identified seeds.\n4) Pattern-based mining: Extract all bilingual data from the page using the learned patterns. For instance, when mining bilingual data from the text in Figure 1, our method identifies \u201cBoxer \u62f3\u5e08\u201d and \u201cEskimo Dog \u7231\u65af\u57fa\u6469\u72ac\u201d as potential translation pairs using a dictionary and a transliteration model (Step 2). We then derive a generalized pattern followed by both pairs: \u201c{BulletNumber}{Punctuation}{English term}{Chinese term}{EndOfLine}\u201d (Step 3). Finally, we apply this pattern to extract all translation pairs from the text (Step 4).\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we list some related work. The overview of our mining approach is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we give detailed introduction to each of the four modules in our mining approach. The experimental results are reported in Section 5 followed by our conclusion and some future work in Section 6.\n\nPlease note that in this paper we describe our method using example bilingual web pages in English and Chinese, however, the method can be applied to extract bilingual data from web pages written in any other pair of languages, such as Japanese and English, Korean and English, etc.", "scores": {"ppl": 47.26252365112305, "some": 0.8810736123426461, "bart": -1.3873200592067507, "acc": 0.0}}}

Scholars and researchers are actively exploring whether these two technological advancements can effectively complement one another, as well as how they might be seamlessly integrated. There remains significant debate regarding whether future research should prioritize knowledge graphs assisting language models or vice versa, leaving this question open-ended. In our pursuit to advance research on the integration of knowledge graphs and large models, we have embarked on the TechGPT-1.0 and TechGPT-2.0 projects. These initiatives involve the release of three advanced 7B-scale instruction fine-tuning models, in addition to a QLoRA model specifically designed for processing long texts.\n\nThe comprehensive models developed through the TechGPT projects are primarily focused on a variety of subtasks related to the construction of knowledge graphs, including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). Moreover, we are committed to providing thorough insights into the processes of data collection and processing. Our team will share valuable experiences related to debugging the Ascend server, while also detailing our model training procedures. This information intends to serve as a crucial resource for researchers aiming to train large-scale language models on the Ascend server platform. Within our research group, experienced researchers have curated extensive batches of knowledge graphs to construct datasets for tasks such as NER and RTE. These datasets have been meticulously adapted to conform to specific instructions, thus refining the data format accordingly.\n\nSignificantly, the knowledge graph utilized for constructing the subtask dataset draws from open-source data as well as research data gathered from prior projects undertaken by our group. This data is meticulously collated and manually annotated by our researchers. To preserve the broad capabilities of the large language model throughout the fine-tuning process, we adhere closely to conclusions derived from previous experimental findings. An extensive volume of general instruction fine-tuning data is compiled, which is then combined with knowledge graph domain data in precise proportions, culminating in approximately four million instances of instruction fine-tuning data. Additionally, notable differences exist between model training on the Ascend server and the traditional use of NVIDIA graphics cards. Our objective is to provide insights into the unique challenges and practices encountered when training models on the Ascend server, offering essential guidance for researchers considering future exploration on this platform.\n\nDue to constraints in our server resources, detailed experimentation on the models within the TechGPT projects was not conducted.

These sentences exhibit common reasoning language structures but do not match real reasoning processes described by epistemology. Although epistemology has its imperfections, it provides a better system for determining justified true beliefs than the statistical correlation model of LLMs. LLMs encode texts into a high-dimensional embedding space, which is continuous and semantically aligned. Words related to a concept have similar values in certain dimensions; for example, words with feminine qualities often appear opposite those with masculine qualities. Language structures are sequential patterns of word embedding vectors. Composing language structures involves predicting sequences of embedding vectors based on context.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Setting the price inefficiently will have marked and measurable effects on your numbers. It will impact your overall profitability and market position. You need to learn to recognize the symptoms of having either a low or high price point, such as decreased sales volume or increased customer complaints. This can indicate that you may need to make a change, such as adjusting your pricing strategy or improving product value. Companies often underprice their products to sell higher volumes, expecting that customers will assume they're getting a deal, especially in a down economy. Doing this, however, can give the impression that the product is of low quality, not that they're getting their money's worth. Overpricing may drive your customers elsewhere; studies show that 60% of consumers compare prices before making a purchase. Especially when you're trying to get your feet on the ground as your business gets started, it can be tempting to set the price too high. To overcome this temptation, focus on long-term customer loyalty and competitive pricing. The investment of starting a business can be scary and you'll probably want to start covering costs right away, but always consider the customer's perspective to ensure sustainable growth. Setting it at a point you'll make money will only work if people are willing to pay for it. For example, offering bundled deals or loyalty discounts can attract more customers. Monitor your profits and prices at least monthly to quickly identify trends and make necessary adjustments. Break down the cost/gains of every product so that you know how each contributes to your overall profitability month-to-month. Visual aids like charts and graphs can help illustrate this concept. This detailed analysis can give a clear picture of your financial flow, helping you make more informed decisions. Talk to your customers and listen to their feedback, as their insights are invaluable. Take customer feedback seriously, as it can provide critical information for improving your pricing strategy. If they enjoy your product but complain about the price, you might consider conducting market research or offering limited-time discounts to find a balance. Develop a budget plan to better manage your finances and ensure long-term sustainability. Focus on a detailed and realistic long-term strategy that will gradually make your business profitable. This might not involve making drastic changes right away, but slowly moving toward an overall goal of profitability, emphasizing the importance of patience in business growth. Jumping from selling an iPhone case for $5 to selling one for $12 can significantly reduce your customer base, even if the price change is justified for your business. Instead, raise the price incrementally and invest time in marketing the product's benefits and advantages, rather than apologizing for the increase. Treat the price change as a benefit by highlighting the enhanced value, rather than presenting it as an inconvenience. Sudden increases will look like desperate moves made by a struggling business, which may or may not be true; research shows that sudden price hikes can decrease customer trust. You want to avoid the impression that you're raising prices out of necessity; transparency is crucial. Rather, you need to make it seem as if you're raising prices because the product is of superior quality and worth the investment. Watch your sales volume immediately after making the change to quickly determine the impact. If the move was too sudden, you'll see a negative change, suggesting that you need to enhance your marketing efforts or add more value to justify the new price. Unless your competition is lowering their price, or you're just not getting the kind of traffic you need to make your business profitable, you generally want to avoid lowering prices; competitive pricing is essential. Lowering the price may suggest another kind of desperation\u2014that people are avoiding your store, potentially damaging your brand image. Using promotions for limited periods of time, or coupons that expire, you can help drive customers toward a particular product or service, making promotions more effective. Use discount tactics and targeted promotions rather than lowering the price all at once, highlighting the importance of flexibility. You can even alter the amount that someone gets for the same price, like offering a \"buy one, get one free\" deal. For example, November is a month of diabetes awareness, which can influence your pricing strategy. During November, you may charge more for sugary drinks and use the profits to offset the cost of offering discounts on healthier foods, aligning with the awareness campaign. Make sure to inform customers about this, as it can influence their choices and make them feel better about paying more for something, emphasizing the importance of transparency. They will also understand that the price changes are temporary and purpose-driven, fostering trust. Avoid seeming desperate, as maintaining a professional image is crucial for your business reputation. For example, an empty restaurant may give the impression that the food is not delicious, potentially driving customers away.

Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of models that are larger by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier models, such as GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019], T-NLG [Rosset, 2020], GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020], and Switch-C [Fedus et al., 2021]. These models offer increased capacity and complexity, allowing them to learn from vast datasets and produce human-like language, which significantly advances the state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks by providing deeper insights and more sophisticated language understanding. These large models offer significant benefits, including the ability to produce more accurate and nuanced responses in various NLP tasks, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art results in areas like conversational agents\u2014where they can engage in sophisticated dialogues, sentiment analysis\u2014where they better understand emotional subtleties, and automated content generation\u2014which requires understanding and mimicking human writing styles. However, the trend towards larger models raises several concerns, including the need for substantial computational resources, increased memory requirements, and the significant environmental impact of training such models, prompting researchers and developers to explore more energy-efficient algorithms and hardware optimizations to mitigate these effects. The challenges of deploying large models in production environments are amplified by the high cost and complexity of maintaining the necessary infrastructure, which includes ensuring adequate storage, processing power, and efficient data handling; potential solutions being explored involve model compression techniques, such as pruning and distillation, and the use of more efficient hardware accelerators.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.969331741333008, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.4797768592834473, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "In recent years, transformer-based pre-trained language models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, have established themselves as the foundational approach for addressing a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are particularly adept at tasks like question answering and text classification, thanks to their robust architecture and pre-training on vast amounts of data. However, the field continues to evolve rapidly, with newer models such as GPT-2, T-NLG, GPT-3, and Switch-C emerging. These models are significantly larger than their predecessors, often boasting several orders of magnitude more parameters. While these enormous models push the boundaries of what is possible in NLP, achieving state-of-the-art results across many tasks, they also introduce substantial challenges.\n\nOne of the primary concerns with these colossal models is their computational and memory demands, which escalate dramatically with size. This escalation makes it prohibitively expensive and challenging to deploy such models in production settings or on resource-constrained edge devices. Additionally, the environmental impact of the computational resources needed to train and run these models is considerable, contributing to the ongoing discourse on sustainable AI practices. In response to these concerns, the field of model compression has gained momentum, seeking to mitigate the resource demands of large language models (LMs).\n\nWeight pruning has emerged as a particularly promising compression technique, effectively reducing the memory footprint of models without significantly compromising performance. Studies have demonstrated that pruning can be applied to cut down on the number of parameters in a model, thereby diminishing its size and resource requirements. However, achieving high sparsity ratios in transformer-based LMs necessitates sophisticated pruning strategies. Researchers have developed various methods tailored for this purpose, although these techniques often require specific modifications and careful tuning to maintain model quality.\n\nInterestingly, research by Gordon et al. has revealed that the timing of pruning\u2014whether during the pre-training or transfer learning phase of a model\u2014does not significantly impact the model's accuracy. This finding implies that a language model can undergo pruning during its initial training phase, after which it can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks without necessitating task-specific adjustments. This insight paves the way for more efficient training processes and resource usage in deploying NLP models.\n\nIn our work, we introduce a novel method called Prune Once for All (Prune OFA), which combines weight pruning and model distillation to create pre-trained transformer-based language models with high sparsity ratios. We apply Prune OFA to different variants of BERT, including BERT-Base, BERT-Large, and DistilBERT, resulting in sparse versions of these models. Our experiments demonstrate that these sparse models can be fine-tuned to achieve task-specific performance with minimal accuracy loss, even for challenging tasks like SQuADv1.1 and various tasks from the GLUE Benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, our approach allows for additional compression through quantization-aware training, leading to models that maintain an impressive compression-to-accuracy ratio. The contributions of our work are threefold: Firstly, we propose an architecture-agnostic method for training sparse pre-trained language models. Secondly, we showcase the process of fine-tuning these models on downstream tasks, resulting in sparse and quantized models that alleviate the need for task-specific pruning and tuning. Lastly, we share our research library, complete with example scripts for reproducing our work on other model architectures, along with the sparse pre-trained models developed in this study.\n\nOverall, our method not only addresses the pressing issue of model size and resource consumption but also provides a practical solution to deploying efficient NLP models in diverse environments.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The sooner the cat sees a veterinarian, the better care the animal will receive, as early detection of health issues can prevent serious complications, promote full recovery, and ensure timely intervention, highlighting the importance of addressing potential problems early on, whereas delayed treatment might lead to worsening conditions that could become more difficult to manage and potentially life-threatening. Strokes in cats, though not always as devastating as in humans, can still cause severe neurological damage or even death, making immediate veterinary attention crucial to prevent further complications, such as long-term disability, and safeguard the cat's health by ensuring prompt treatment and management. You may want to call ahead and inform the veterinarian of specific symptoms you've observed, such as sudden disorientation, weakness, unusual vocalizations, changes in appetite, lack of balance, or any other concerning behaviors like excessive drooling or seizures, to ensure they are prepared for your arrival with the necessary equipment and knowledge to provide immediate care. If it is at night, you may need to take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital, which specializes in providing 24/7 care for urgent conditions like strokes, offering immediate intervention for potentially life-threatening situations, and having the expertise to handle severe and complex cases around the clock. Your vet will ask you detailed questions to help determine a course of action, such as changes in behavior, eating habits, or recent stressors, as these insights are critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment by revealing possible underlying causes like anxiety, dietary deficiencies, or environmental factors. They will ask questions about various behaviors, including changes in social interaction or unusual hiding, to gather clues about the cat's health condition, as these behaviors can indicate stress, discomfort, or illness, providing essential context for the veterinarian's assessment. They will inquire if your cat could have ingested any harmful substances like toxic plants, over-the-counter medications, or household chemicals, which can cause symptoms similar to strokes, and identifying these toxins is crucial for proper treatment, potentially involving decontamination or specific antidotes. They might also ask if there was any known trauma, such as falls, that could lead to neurological symptoms, as identifying physical injuries is crucial for treatment and can guide further diagnostic steps, like imaging or physical examinations, to assess the extent of the damage. They will ask about any changes in water or food intake, as these can indicate underlying health issues affecting your cat's overall condition, like dehydration, nutrient deficiencies, or metabolic disorders, which can influence recovery and necessitate dietary adjustments or fluid therapy. They will also likely ask if there has been any vomiting, diarrhea, or general lethargy, as monitoring digestive health and energy levels can reveal important information about a cat's condition and point to systemic issues, such as infections, gastrointestinal problems, or metabolic disorders. You will need to know if your cat has had its rabies vaccination recently, as this can help rule out certain viral infections that may mimic stroke symptoms and ensure that other potential causes are considered, providing a clearer diagnostic path for the veterinarian. Your veterinarian may order a blood panel, urinalysis, X-rays, or an ultrasound to gather comprehensive health data and identify any abnormalities contributing to the stroke, as these tests provide critical information about your cat's internal health status, like organ function, electrolyte balance, and structural issues. These tests can help determine stroke or underlying conditions like heart disease, hypertension, or thyroid issues, which often accompany strokes in cats and require specific management to improve health outcomes, highlighting the need for a thorough and multi-faceted diagnostic approach. If your vet suspects a serious neurological problem, a veterinarian specializing in neurology may be needed for a consult to provide expert evaluation and treatment options, offering specialized insights into complex conditions and advanced therapeutic strategies tailored to the cat's specific needs. The specialist may request additional tests such as an MRI or CT scan, which can precisely identify blood clots or brain damage, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning by providing detailed images of the cat's brain and helping to pinpoint the exact location and extent of the problem. These tests are performed on animals similarly to humans, utilizing advanced imaging technology to capture detailed views of the brain and nervous system, although tailored to the anatomical differences in cats, ensuring accurate diagnosis while considering species-specific characteristics. In many cases, your cat\u2019s symptoms may resolve after a few days of tender loving care at home, which involves ensuring a stress-free environment, providing consistent monitoring, and offering supportive care to promote recovery, such as maintaining a quiet space, gentle handling, and regular feeding. In some cases, the cat may require hospitalization with the veterinarian to receive intensive care and monitoring of its neurological condition, essential for managing severe symptoms, administering specialized treatments, and preventing further complications through continuous professional oversight. Neurological outcomes can be very difficult to determine, as they depend on factors like the severity of the initial event, the cat's age, and overall health, making prediction challenging and requiring careful monitoring to adapt care plans and anticipate possible changes in the cat's condition. You and your veterinarian will need time to assess any long-lasting effects or conditions, adjusting treatment based on ongoing evaluations and observations, which is vital for optimizing recovery and addressing any new issues that may arise, ensuring the best possible quality of life for your cat. If your cat exhibits motion sickness as a symptom, a medication such as Cerenia can manage it, effectively reducing nausea and discomfort during recovery by blocking the neurotransmitters that trigger vomiting, and improving the cat's overall well-being and comfort. In other situations, the cat may have a sustained head tilt, which can be managed with supportive care and monitoring for any associated balance issues to ensure the cat maintains its quality of life, such as using padded bedding and preventing falls. Other cats may continue to have some balance problems, requiring adjustments in the home environment to prevent falls and injuries, such as adding ramps, soft padding, or barriers to restrict access to hazardous areas, ensuring the cat's safety and mobility. Since the brain is complicated, the full outcome of a neurological event cannot be fully predicted, as the complex interplay of neural pathways can lead to varying recovery scenarios, highlighting the need for individualized care and ongoing assessment to tailor treatment plans. It may be tough to watch your pet stumble around, but offering support and maintaining a calm presence can help ease both your and your pet's stress, providing reassurance, stability, and a sense of security during the recovery process. Don't worry, as they are likely not in pain; however, it's essential to monitor for any signs of discomfort and consult with your veterinarian for appropriate pain management to ensure their comfort, which may involve medications, environmental adjustments, or other therapeutic measures. Any cat that has had neurological problems should be kept indoors for its safety, where a controlled environment can prevent accidents and exposure to further hazards, reducing the risk of additional injury and allowing for better monitoring and care. You may need to confine the cat to one room for a while after the cat comes home to ensure a quiet, safe recovery space free from potential stressors, allowing for a peaceful healing process and minimizing the risk of further injury or stress. This is for the cat\u2019s safety, especially if you have other pets in the household that may react aggressively to the cat's abnormal behavior, necessitating gradual and supervised introductions to prevent conflicts and ensure a harmonious environment. While recovering, you may need to help the cat eat, drink, or go to the litter box, providing essential support as it regains strength and coordination to ensure its basic needs are met and to facilitate a smoother recovery process. This will depend on the severity of the condition, with milder cases requiring less intervention, while more severe cases may need extensive care, influenced by the cat's age, health, and the specific neurological disorder, necessitating a tailored approach to care. You may need to pick your cat up and carry it to the food bowl, to the water dish, or to the litter box, offering physical support as needed to help it navigate its environment safely, ensuring it can access essential resources without difficulty. Watch for signs that your cat is hungry or needs to go to the litter box, such as meowing or general discontent, which can indicate when assistance is needed, as these behaviors communicate its needs and help you respond appropriately. It will take time to know if this will be a temporary or a permanent necessity for your cat, as the long-term effects of neurological disorders vary widely, depending on the specific condition and response to treatment, requiring patience and ongoing evaluation. While monitoring the cat and noting symptoms, be careful with any children around the cat to prevent accidental injury from startled or disoriented reactions, ensuring both the cat's and the children's safety and comfort by supervising interactions closely. If your cat is confused, disoriented, or seizing, it may bite or scratch unintentionally, highlighting the need for careful supervision and awareness of its behavior to protect both the cat and handlers from potential injuries during vulnerable moments. Keeping children away is the best way to avoid potential injury, ensuring a safe environment for both the cat and the children, because interactions can be unpredictable during recovery, and minimizing risk is essential for everyone's well-being. With proper nursing and care, some cats recover very well, regaining their previous quality of life with time and support, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement through dedicated and attentive caregiving. Even in these situations, recovery can take anywhere from 2 to 4 months, demanding patience and consistent care from pet owners to support the healing process and adapt to their cat's needs, ensuring a thorough and effective recovery. Stay patient with the process and remember how much your cat needs you while recovering, as your presence and care can significantly influence its healing journey, providing emotional security and strength during a challenging time.", "scores": {"ppl": 28.969514846801758, "some": 0.8672600587209066, "bart": -3.019989490509033, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "The quicker a cat receives veterinary attention, the better the care it will receive, which ultimately leads to a greater chance of recovery.

This is generally appropriate when hateful words or slurs are used knowingly. In a work environment, you can say, \u201cIf I hear that word again, I\u2019m going to have to speak to our supervisor.\u201d In a family context, you can say, \u201cI think I will have to go home if you continue speaking like that.\u201d Just tell them straight forward. We usually overthink things and make the worst of it. Being straightforward does not mean that you should rub it in their face. You just have to say how you feel without gracing your self-ego as well as theirs. People always try to tell some indirect stories and it ends up vindicating the other person. Knowing how you feel may help the person understand your perspective. They might not understand why what they said is offensive, but knowing that you feel hurt could be enough to help them change their behavior. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express your feelings. This means saying, \u201cI felt angry when you used that word to describe our coworker\u201d instead of, \u201cIt was wrong of you to use that word to describe our coworker.\u201d Another example is saying, \u201cI felt embarrassed when you told that joke\u201d instead of, \u201cThat joke wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d Try to express your feelings without getting visibly upset during the conversation. If the remark was extremely offensive, you may feel panicked or even start to cry. If this happens, that\u2019s okay. You may simply need to take some time and space before you can have a calm conversation. If you find yourself becoming upset during the conversation, excuse yourself temporarily. Say something along the lines of, \"Please give me a minute, I'd like to discuss this with a level head.\"", "scores": {"ppl": 31.12822151184082, "some": 0.8809368141695985, "bart": -0.7504456360370685, "acc": 1.0}}}

Prioritizing sleep is crucial because it allows your body to recover, boosts your energy levels, and helps manage weight by regulating your appetite and metabolism. People who get fewer than 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night are more likely to carry weight in their mid-section. Poor sleep disrupts hormones and raises cortisol, hindering weight loss and focus. Try to set aside the hour before you go to bed to turn off electronics and relax from the day, so that you can get restful sleep. Incorporate stress-reducing activities like yoga or ambient music into your daily routine. When your body feels stress because of work or your personal life, it releases cortisol, which can tell you to pack on pounds on your waist. Try deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or ambient music to reduce anxiety. To effectively lose fat and tone muscles, focus on enhancing your aerobic or cardio exercise routines. Aim for 5-6 workouts per week, dividing your cardio into 15- to 30-minute sessions for easier maintenance and consistent benefits. Extending workouts from 30 minutes to an hour can significantly enhance your progress. Longer workouts burn more fat and build lean muscle, shaping body curves. If you're short on time, split your routine into two 30-minute sessions or try a morning and evening workout. Engage in a quick 30-minute gym session followed by a speed walk after dinner. Consistency is key\u2014ensure at least one 30-minute workout daily for lasting benefits. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is where you do short bursts of intense work followed by less intense activity or rest. For example, you can try running as fast as you can for 1 minute or start with 15 or 30 seconds. This kind of workout is great for blasting fat away. Walk for twice the time you run\u20142 minutes for 1 minute of running, 1 minute for 30 seconds, or 30 seconds for 15 seconds. Repeat 5 rounds for a quick, efficient, fat-burning 15-minute workout. As your fitness improves, gradually increase the duration, intensity, and total workout time to 30 or 45 minutes. For balanced muscle tone, include exercises targeting both the upper and lower body, like push-ups and lunges. Vary your routine to engage different muscle groups and maintain a high metabolism. Try a group class like spinning, barre, cardio burn, flow yoga, or boot camp for motivation and variety. Use machines like the elliptical, treadmill, or stair stepper at least once a week for low-impact cardio. Use interval settings on machines to alternate between high and low intensities, increasing calorie burn. Include activities like swimming, hiking, speed walking, or biking for low-impact cardio options. Combine 30-minute strength training sessions with cardio for enhanced endurance and muscle building. Use equipment like weight machines, dumbbells, or resistance bands to diversify your strength training. Shorten rest periods between sets to keep your heart rate elevated and maximize calorie burn. Focus on building core strength while toning your legs and arms for a balanced, curvy figure. Don't neglect the back of your body\u2014strengthening it supports balanced curves. Strength train 3 to 4 times weekly to build muscle and boost overall fitness. After cardio burns off excess fat, strength training helps sculpt hourglass curves. Squats effectively target the glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings for stronger lower body muscles. Maintain proper form by keeping your core engaged and your spine neutral during squats for safety and effectiveness. Incorporate exercises like step-ups with hand weights to target glutes, hips, and thighs. Use a sturdy bench at knee-height or higher to perform step-ups effectively. Step onto the bench with one foot, then the other, and step down in reverse, repeating 12 times per side. Side steps help tone the hips and outer thighs by engaging the lateral muscles. Start with half-planks on your knees, then progress to full planks as your core strength improves. Side planks specifically target obliques, enhancing waistline definition. Serratus push-ups strengthen the shoulders and chest, enhancing upper body curves. Begin in a low plank, flex your core, and perform slow, controlled shoulder blade movements. Slow, deliberate movements during exercises enhance muscle activation and stability. Clam shells target the outer thighs\u2014keep heels together and hips aligned for proper form. Do 20 clam shells per side, ensuring hips stay stacked to isolate the thigh muscles effectively.", "scores": {"ppl": 41.80449676513672, "some": 0.8633530934651693, "bart": -2.457617998123169, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Achieving significant, positive changes in your body requires both physical and mental commitment.

Dedicate the hour before bed to unwinding from the day by turning off electronics and relaxing to ensure restful sleep.\n\nIncorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine. When stress from work or personal life hits, your body releases cortisol, which can lead to weight gain around the waist. Engage in deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or listen to ambient music to alleviate anxiety. To enhance fat loss and muscle toning, increase your aerobic or cardio workouts. Aim to exercise 5-6 days a week with cardio sessions lasting at least 45 minutes each. Increasing workout duration from 30 minutes to an hour can significantly improve tone and fat loss, helping you achieve more defined curves quickly.\n\nIf you're short on time, break up your workouts into two 30-minute sessions. For instance, do a 30-minute gym workout, and follow it with a brisk walk after dinner. Ensure at least one session is 30 minutes to maximize benefits. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) involves alternating between short bursts of intense activity and periods of less intense activity or rest. This type of workout is highly effective for burning fat. Begin by warming up, then switch between low/moderate and high intensity for 2 to 4 minutes at a time.\n\nFor example, run as fast as you can for 1 minute (or start with 15 or 30 seconds if needed), then walk for twice that time (2 minutes for 1 minute of running; 1 minute for 30 seconds; 30 seconds for 15 seconds). Repeat this cycle five times for a powerful 15-minute workout. As your fitness improves, extend your running time, increase speed, jog instead of walk during rest periods, and lengthen your sessions to 30 or 45 minutes. To achieve a curvaceous body, balance upper body workouts with lower body exercises.

Add hand weights for extra resistance. Try step-ups to enhance your glutes, hips, and thighs by placing a bench at knee height in front of you. Step up with one foot, followed by the other, then lower them back down. Repeat 12 times with each foot leading.\n\nSide steps can enhance your hips and the outer thighs. Incorporate planks into your routine, starting with a half-plank on your knees if you're a beginner. As your strength increases, progress to a full-body plank and try side planks to target your oblique muscles. Serratus pushups will work your shoulders and chest, supporting upper body curves. Begin on your hands and knees, lower onto your elbows, engage your core, and get into a low plank with legs extended. Squeeze your shoulder blades together for 2 to 5 seconds before releasing.

It's not necessary for both partners to wear the same type of jewelry; what matters is that the pieces share a common element\u2014be it a similar style, a shared symbol, or a meaningful inscription.\n\nFor individuals engaged in manual or mechanical labor, wearing a ring on a necklace is often deemed a safer and more practical option. This allows them to maintain the symbol of their commitment close to their heart while avoiding any risk of injury that might come from wearing a ring on their finger.\n\nAnother innovative option to consider is getting a tattoo as a symbol of love. While some may initially hesitate, thinking, \"I'm not a tattoo person,\" the permanence of a tattoo can beautifully mirror the desire for a marriage to last forever. Tattoos don't need to be elaborate; they can be as simple as your partner's name inked on a discreet part of your body\u2014around your ring finger, along your side, or even hidden beneath your hair, like a cherished secret shared only between you and your beloved. The infinity symbol is a popular choice among married couples, representing the endless nature of their love.\n\nIf tattoos aren't appealing, consider a second piercing, perhaps in the ear or another prominent location. This could serve as a unique and personal declaration of your marital status. When people inquire about it, you can proudly explain that it's a testament to your marriage.\n\nCreativity knows no bounds when it comes to expressing commitment. Crafting something personal that signifies your love can be a deeply meaningful endeavor. This could take the form of a small booklet titled \"10 Reasons I Love You,\" a heart-shaped craft item, or a photo album capturing cherished moments shared with your partner. The possibilities are endless, and the decision rests entirely with you on how to transform this gesture into a symbol of your marriage. Displaying such tokens proudly in your home adds a personal touch and allows visitors to witness the love and dedication you share.\n\nIn some countries, if the original marriage license lacks aesthetic appeal, it is possible to upgrade to a more visually pleasing official document for a nominal fee, depending on the location of your marriage. However, it's important to remember that rings and documents are not the marriage itself. Marriage is fundamentally about the commitment to maintaining a deep, intimate relationship and being present for each other through life's ups and downs.\n\nOne meaningful way to celebrate this commitment is by promising to reaffirm your love for each other on each wedding anniversary. This could be done through heartfelt words, poetry, imagery, or any other self-created expression that requires personal effort to articulate what you cherish about your partner. You might choose to make this reaffirmation a private affair or share it with friends and family by hosting a small gathering or an intimate party.\n\nSome couples even choose to renew their vows, recreating the magic of their wedding day at significant milestones, such as every decade or during specific long-term anniversaries. This tradition not only strengthens the bond between partners but also serves as a beautiful reminder of the journey they've embarked upon together.", "scores": {"ppl": 28.283395767211914, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -2.666625738143921, "acc": 0.5}}}

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), which boast parameter sizes exceeding a hundred billion and are pre-trained on massive datasets. However, there is a lack of research on LLM architectures specifically tailored for specialized domains with limited resources. To address the issue of limited language resources, several strategies have emerged, such as simultaneous pretraining with in-domain data (Wada et al., 2020) and domain-adaptive pretraining, which involves fine-tuning a generic language model with in-domain data (Gururangan et al., 2020). Selecting the appropriate pre-training technique depends on the specific task data and available resources, yet determining the most effective use of limited clinical task data in pretraining and identifying the optimal data for these methods remains unresolved. This study aims to assess and compare various techniques using a small task corpus for pretraining BERT models in the Turkish clinical domain, which represents low-resource settings. This work introduces four pre-trained language models for the Turkish clinical domain. These models investigate the effects of different corpus selections, combining a small task-related corpus with pretraining strategies in the Turkish clinical domain.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The proposed spectral clustering algorithm starts with a dataset [MATH] and a suitable similarity function [MATH], for instance, the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF). The spectral clustering process begins by constructing a pairwise similarity matrix [MATH] and then employs the top eigenvectors of W (following a specific normalization) for dimensionality reduction, ultimately using k-means to partition the data into k clusters in the lower-dimensional space (von Luxburg, 2007). Spectral clustering, mathematically simple yet robust, effectively accommodates nonconvex geometries and achieves accurate separation of distinct shapes. This has led to successful applications in various real-world tasks, such as image segmentation (Shi and Malik, 2000) and document clustering (Dhillon, 2001), often surpassing traditional methods like k-means. Spectral clustering boasts a comprehensive theoretical framework (von Luxburg, 2007), with intriguing links to kernel k-means (Dhillon et al., 2004), random walk (Meila and Shi, 2001), graph cut (Shi and Malik, 2000) (founded on spectral graph theory (Chung, 1996)), and matrix perturbation analysis (Ng et al., 2001).", "scores": {"ppl": 40.642181396484375, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -1.565212368965149, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Spectral clustering, as outlined by von Luxburg (2007), begins with a data set and a similarity function, such as the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF). It constructs a pairwise similarity matrix and uses the top eigenvectors of this matrix, post-normalization, to embed the data into a low-dimensional space. Here, k-means is applied to group the data into k clusters. Despite its mathematical simplicity, spectral clustering adeptly handles nonconvex geometries and separates various non-overlapping shapes with precision. This adaptability has led to its successful application in tasks like image segmentation (Shi and Malik, 2000) and document clustering (Dhillon, 2001), often outperforming traditional methods like k-means. Furthermore, spectral clustering is supported by a rich theoretical framework (von Luxburg, 2007), with connections to kernel k-means (Dhillon et al., 2004), random walks (Meila and Shi, 2001), graph cuts (Shi and Malik, 2000), spectral graph theory (Chung, 1996), and matrix perturbation analysis (Ng et al., 2001).\n\nHowever, spectral clustering's computational demand is high due to the n x n matrix, especially as n increases. This has led to efforts to create fast, approximate algorithms for large data sets (Fowlkes et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2009; Sakai and Imiya, 2009; and others). Many of these methods utilize a landmark set to decrease computational complexity. They first identify a small set of representative data points, called landmarks, from the original data set. Subsequently, an affinity matrix is constructed between the original data and the landmarks.\n\nDifferent scalable methods leverage this matrix in various ways to perform clustering. For instance, the column-sampling spectral clustering (cSPEC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2009) treats this matrix as a column-reduced version of the original similarity matrix and uses its left singular vectors to approximate the eigenvectors. However, cSPEC primarily addresses unnormalized spectral clustering, with unclear extensions to normalized versions (Shi and Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2001). Another method, the landmark-based spectral clustering (LSC) algorithm (Cai and Chen, 2015), uses a row-sparsified version of the matrix to provide sparse representations of the data, avoiding costly dictionary learning and sparse coding tasks. It applies L1 normalization to rows followed by square-root L1 column normalization. While effective, there remains a gap between its theoretical sparse-coding motivation and practical implementation. A third example is the k-means-based approximate spectral clustering (KASP) algorithm (Yan et al., 2009). This method employs k-means to form small clusters from the data, then performs spectral clustering on their centroids, which serve as landmarks. The original data is then clustered by extending the centroid clustering using 1-nearest neighbor classification. This approach is quick but sensitive to the k-means clustering, as it reduces the data to a limited set of centroids.\n\nIn our work, we introduce a new landmark-based scalable spectral clustering approach that integrates the co-clustering framework by Dhillon (2001) with diffusion maps (Coifman and Lafon, 2006). We construct a bipartite graph with the data and landmarks as parts, forming edges between each data point and its nearest neighbors in the landmark set. We compute transition probabilities and define a random walk on this graph, generating a diffusion process. The resulting diffusion coordinates capture the global geometry of clusters at various scales, thereby enhancing cluster connectivity. We demonstrate that these diffusion coordinates can be computed directly from an n \u00d7 m matrix. Finally, we propose three strategies for using diffusion coordinates in clustering, depending on the random walk's length.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews necessary background, Section 3 details our methodology, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.", "scores": {"ppl": 40.081443786621094, "some": 0.9054900487263996, "bart": -1.4443293809890747, "acc": 1.0}}}

I still wake up questioning our true purpose in life and how we respond when needed. Many things in our lives remain beyond our understanding. We certainly do not have complete control over every aspect of our lives. The element of surprise can influence our actions at any time and place. Recently, I encountered an unexpected situation that required immediate action without warning or preparation. This event taught me that our worth is measured by our knowledge, which is a powerful force that can save lives. One particular morning, I decided to visit a major store to look at something I was interested in purchasing. That day, I had no other reason to be there. It seemed I was destined to be in the right place to contribute to mankind. While strolling through the store, I noticed someone who appeared irritated and somewhat irrational in their communication with another person. I didn't think much of it and continued with my business. Moments later, it became clear this person was experiencing a medical problem due to their behavior and apparent breathing difficulties. Being CPR certified, I knew how to handle a medical emergency. It was fortunate since no one else around seemed capable of helping this person. I immediately took control and assessed the situation. As I suspected, the person in distress was an elderly man who had collapsed, struggling to breathe and incoherent. I immediately instructed the closest person to call 911 for help as quickly as possible. I then assessed the situation and began administering CPR until the medics arrived. I noticed the man was wearing a medical bracelet and instructed the caller to relay this information to the 911 center to prepare the medics on their way. Saving this man's life felt like an eternity, but it was a relief when the EMS team arrived and took over. The man survived without severe consequences and was doing well after a short hospital stay.

These applications often involve tasks like classification and summarization. Advanced NLP techniques are effective for these tasks when handling text in a single language. However, they encounter challenges with code-mixed text due to a lack of sufficient labeled data. Code-mixed text has gained importance due to the influence of social media platforms. In multilingual countries like India, people often blend their local language with English on social media. Local expressions or entities are naturally conveyed in native languages, resulting in code-mixing. Code-mixing facilitates communication by allowing the incorporation of terms from different languages. One example of code-mixing is: 'This is not a union budget, ye to aam admi ka budget hai,' tagged as 'eng eng eng eng eng hin hin hin hin hin hin hin.' Another is: 'maine aaj WhatsApp and Facebook uninstall kiya h,' tagged as 'hin hin eng eng eng eng hin hin.' Identifying the language of individual words is challenging because the same word may appear in both Hindi and English, depending on the context. For instance, English words like 'are' and 'maze' can also be found in Hindi, as in 'Are mai ghar jaa raha hoon' and 'Aapke to maze hain.' Adding to the complexity, social media text often contains noise, with words written in various forms for emphasis. For example, the word 'good' might have the letter 'o' repeated multiple times, resulting in variations like 'the movie was gooood.' A modern method of representation involves sub-word units, where a word is divided into logical sub-word components. Character and sub-word representations are more robust against noisy text variations than word representations, which treat each variation as a distinct word. Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these input representations. This work is the first to explore sub-word representations for Hindi-English language identification. The task involves identifying the language of each word in a sentence. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used for token classification. We employ these straightforward models with various input representations to assess their effectiveness. These models are often enhanced with a conditional random field (CRF) to improve performance. Nonetheless, we focus on simple architectures, emphasizing input representation. We show that sub-word representation, when combined with these simple models, can outperform more complex architectures discussed in the literature. The language identification module needs to be fast and efficient because it will often be followed by other NLP modules; with this in mind, we experiment with single-layer CNN and LSTM models.

Contact your local assessor's office or tax authority for your property's value. Many assessors offer online tools to check property values by address. Santa Clara County, California, provides an excellent example of such a tool. Financial institutions sometimes offer home value estimates. For instance, Chase Bank has a free online home value tool. Land value consists of the land's worth and the value of improvements on it. To find your property's total value, add these two values. Local assessors usually provide both values. Let's calculate property taxes for a house in ABC County, USA. The county assessor values the land at $357,000. This is due to its proximity to downtown and nearby freeways. The house itself is valued at $307,000. Adding these values gives a total property value of $664,000. We'll use this value to calculate property taxes. Property tax is a percentage of the property's current value. Tax rates vary based on the taxing agency's needs. For example, a county may raise rates to cover budget shortfalls. Up-to-date information is essential. You can get this from your local tax authority. Santa Clara County, California, offers free online tax rate summaries. Many municipalities apply tax rates \"per mill,\" or per $1,000 in value. One mill equals 1/10 of one cent. Practically, 10 mill equals 1%. For example, a 20 mill levy on $100,000 equals 2%, or $2,000. In our example, ABC County has a 10 mill levy. This is 1% of our property's total value. Local governments aren't the only ones relying on property taxes. Other local organizations often require property taxes too. Public school districts get most of their revenue from property taxes. In 2007, they received about 77% from local property taxes. Cities, towns, and other entities may also require property taxes. In our example, Appleton city has a 20 mill (2%) property tax. The Appleton Unified School District levies a 30 mill (3%) tax. To find your total tax liability, add up all tax rates.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Most songs in Western music are built around a set of common chord progressions, which are sequences of chords that form the harmonic foundation of a piece, providing a framework that musicians can follow to create structure and emotion in their compositions, such as the popular I-IV-V-I progression. These progressions are constructed using the diatonic scale, a seven-note scale that includes five whole steps and two half steps in a specific pattern, often used in Western music to create familiar patterns that produce a sense of harmony and structure, and are fundamental in forming major and minor scales. Once you know which chord progressions are most common in the music you listen to, it becomes easier to identify them in songs. By recognizing these progressions, you can better understand the song's structure and anticipate the next chords. Diatonic chords are numbered with Roman numerals according to the root note's position on the scale, such as the tonic as I, the supertonic as ii, the mediant as iii, the subdominant as IV, the dominant as V, the submediant as vi, and the leading tone as vii; for example, in C major, these would be C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, and Bdim. For example, the I chord on the C major scale is the C tonic chord (C-E-G), consisting of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the C major scale, which form the basic triad and establish the tonal center by creating a stable and consonant sound, with the 1st note setting the root, the 3rd defining the chord's quality, and the 5th adding fullness. Minor chords are written with lowercase Roman numerals, such as i, ii\u00b0, and iv, to differentiate them from major chords and reflect their distinct sound; for instance, in A minor, the i chord is A minor (A-C-E), the ii\u00b0 chord is B diminished (B-D-F), and the iv chord is D minor (D-F-A), while in E minor, the i chord is E minor (E-G-B), the iv chord is A minor (A-C-E), and the v chord is B minor (B-D-F#). One of the most common chord progressions in Western popular music is I-IV-V-I, often used in genres like rock, pop, and blues to create a satisfying cycle that resolves back to the tonic, providing a sense of completion and familiarity by establishing a strong harmonic foundation, which helps to reinforce the key and make the music more memorable. Try playing common chords slowly by focusing on each note and how it contributes to the overall sound, allowing you to discern the nuances of the progression by paying attention to the way each interval influences the harmony, and practicing this way can help you develop a keen ear for the subtleties of chord changes. Don\u2019t just stick to root positions, where the notes played are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th scale degrees of the key; practice listening to inversions, too, such as the 3rd, 5th, and 1st, which provide different harmonic textures and add variety to the music by altering the bass note, thereby enriching the harmonic landscape and adding depth. Listen to 7th, diminished, and augmented chords, as well as basic major and minor triads, to understand their unique qualities and how they are used to add tension or resolution in music; for example, a dominant 7th chord like G7 (G-B-D-F) often leads to a tonic chord, resolving tension, while an augmented chord like Caug (C-E-G#) creates an unsettled feeling and is used for dramatic effect. The more you listen to different chords, the more familiar they will become, allowing you to develop an instinct for recognizing their sound and function in music, which will enhance your ability to identify chord progressions and understand their role in shaping the music. For example, in C Major, the root notes are C, E, and G, while E, G, and C are the 3rd, 5th, and 1st scale degrees, respectively, of the first inversion of C, which shifts the bass note and changes the chord's texture, adding variety and smooth voice leading in chord transitions. Try quizzing yourself with a chord identification tool like ToneDear, which helps train your ear to recognize different chords and their qualities within various musical contexts, enhancing your ability to identify them by sound and improving your overall musical skills by providing immediate feedback and practice exercises. Songs written in major keys tend to sound bright, upbeat, happy, or hopeful, while minor keys lend a gloomy, sad, or scary sound, influencing the emotional impact of the music by shaping the listener's mood through tonal qualities and creating distinct atmospheres that evoke specific feelings. The easiest way to determine whether a song is major or minor is to listen to the overall \u201cmood\u201d of the piece. Pay attention to the emotional tone conveyed through melodies, harmonies, and even the lyrical content, as well as the key signature and chord quality used in the composition, which together shape the song's character. While the chords in a minor key song will primarily be minor chords, there will likely be some major chords mixed in to add contrast and complexity, creating unexpected emotional shifts that enhance the music's depth and dynamic range, making the piece more engaging and multifaceted. The reverse is also true of major key songs, where minor chords might be included to introduce tension or emotional depth, enriching the musical landscape by adding layers of complexity and contrast to the otherwise bright sound, thus making the music more compelling and resonant. Once you\u2019ve identified the tonic chord, you will have a good foundation for understanding the rest of the song, as it serves as the central reference point for the harmony and establishes the key, allowing you to map out the chord progressions and overall structure, which is crucial for interpreting and performing the piece accurately. Most songs end on the tonic (I) chord, and many also begin there, creating a sense of closure and balance that feels satisfying to the listener by reinforcing the song's tonal center and providing a stable conclusion, which helps to frame the musical journey cohesively. The tonic chord often serves as the central chord throughout the song, providing a sense of completion or satisfaction by anchoring the music harmonically and guiding the progression, which helps listeners feel grounded and connected to the music, making the experience more fulfilling. For example, \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star,\u201d when played in the key of C major, begins and ends on a C major tonic chord, as do many traditional folk songs like \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat,\" and \"Amazing Grace.\" In most songs, the bass line serves as the harmonic accompaniment to the melody, often outlining the chord progressions and reinforcing the harmonic structure by providing a foundation that supports the overall sound. The bass line tends to be built on the root notes of each chord in the song, offering a solid foundation for the harmonic structure and supporting the melody by emphasizing the essential tonal elements, which ensures that the harmony is clearly articulated and the music remains coherent. This means that if you can figure out the notes of the bass \u201cmelody,\u201d you can pinpoint the root of each chord. From there, you can build the harmonic framework of the piece by adding the necessary chord tones, allowing you to understand the song's development and progression, and enhancing your ability to play or analyze the music. For example, if you are listening to \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d in C major, you may identify the notes C, F, C, F, C, G, C in the bass line of the first four measures, while in \"Jingle Bells,\" you might find G, D, G, C in the bass, which helps to outline the chord progressions and provide structure. Similarly, in \"Silent Night,\" you might hear G, C, D, and G, and in \"Happy Birthday,\" you might find the bass notes C, G, F, and G in the opening lines, providing the harmonic basis by outlining the chord progression and supporting the melody, which helps to create a cohesive musical foundation. These are the root notes of the chords for those measures, laying the groundwork for the song's harmony and ensuring a coherent harmonic progression that guides the listener through the musical journey, making the music more engaging and structured. Consider whether it sounds major or minor. Do you hear tones other than the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the chord, such as the 7th, which adds depth and complexity by creating dissonance or tension that seeks resolution, often leading to a more stable sound, thereby enriching the harmonic texture. After you\u2019ve figured out the chords, play them in order, following the rhythm of the piece to maintain the musical flow and ensure the progression aligns with the intended timing, which is crucial for conveying the intended emotion and structure, making the performance more effective. You may find it helpful to play along with a recording of the song to ensure that you have the timing right and can match the tempo accurately, which is crucial for maintaining the song's energy and feel, allowing for a cohesive performance that stays true to the original. Depending on the type of instrument you\u2019re playing, this could mean playing the different parts together or playing the chords as accompaniment to a voice or a second instrument, providing a full, rich sound that enhances the musical experience and supports the overall performance. Run through the song several times to make sure that your chord changes are timed correctly with the melody, improving your performance and coordination by reinforcing muscle memory and timing, which contributes to a more polished and confident presentation that resonates with the audience. For example, if you are playing the piano, you will probably play the chords primarily with your left hand while your right hand carries the melody, whereas on a guitar, you might strum the chords while picking the melody on the higher strings, both approaches ensuring a balanced and harmonious rendition of the song.", "scores": {"ppl": 19.44398307800293, "some": 0.8714896043141683, "bart": -2.5165677070617676, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "In Western music, most songs revolve around a set of familiar chord progressions, which are typically based on the diatonic scale. Understanding these progressions can make it significantly easier to identify them in the songs you wish to learn. Diatonic chords are labeled using Roman numerals that correspond to the position of the root note on the scale. For instance, the I chord on the C major scale is identified as the C tonic chord, which consists of the notes C, E, and G. These notes represent the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the C major scale. When it comes to minor chords, they are denoted with lowercase Roman numerals, such as i, ii, and iv. One of the most prevalent chord progressions in Western popular music is the I-IV-V-I progression. It is beneficial to practice playing these common chords and to pay close attention to their distinct sounds. Don't limit yourself to just root positions, where the notes played are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes, or scale degrees, of the key. Expanding your practice to include listening to inversions, such as the 3rd, 5th, and 8th, can be very helpful. It's also wise to familiarize yourself with 7th, diminished, and augmented chords, as well as basic major and minor triads. The more you train your ear to recognize these chords, the more familiar they will become to you. For example, in the C Major scale, the root notes are C, E, and G, while E, G, and C represent the 3rd, 5th, and 8th scale degrees, respectively, of the first inversion of C.

Conversely, songs in minor keys often convey a gloomy, sad, or eerie atmosphere. The simplest way to determine whether a song is in a major or minor key is to listen to the overall mood of the piece. In songs composed in minor keys, the chords will predominantly be minor chords, although there may be some major chords interspersed. The reverse is generally true for songs written in major keys. Once you\u2019ve identified the tonic chord of a song, you will have a solid foundation for figuring out the rest of the piece. Most songs conclude with the tonic chord, and many also begin with it. The tonic chord typically serves as the predominant chord throughout the song. Hearing this chord often provides a sense of completion or satisfaction. For example, \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star,\u201d when played in the key of C major, starts and finishes on a C major tonic chord.\n\nIn many songs, the bass line provides harmonic accompaniment to the melody. Bass lines are generally built on the root notes of each chord in the song. This means that if you can figure out the notes of the bass \"melody,\" you can identify the root of each chord and build from there. For example, if you are listening to \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d in C major, you may identify the notes C, F, C, F, C, G, and C in the bass line of the first four measures. These notes indicate the root notes of the chords for those measures. Once you\u2019ve determined the root notes, consider the quality of each chord. Does it sound major or minor to your ear? Are there any tones present other than the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the chord, such as the 7th? After identifying the chords, play them in sequence, following the rhythm of the piece. It may be helpful to play along with a recording of the song to ensure that your timing is accurate. Depending on the type of instrument you\u2019re playing, this could involve playing different parts simultaneously or playing the chords as an accompaniment to a voice or second instrument. Practice the song multiple times to ensure that your chord changes are correctly timed with the melody. For example, if you are playing the piano, you will likely play the chords primarily with your left hand while your right hand carries the melody.", "scores": {"ppl": 20.746845245361328, "some": 0.8949496746063232, "bart": -1.3544172048568726, "acc": 1.0}}}

Perhaps you just want to feel more comfortable around them yourself. Before starting a conversation, make sure you know what your goals are in bringing up your concerns. It\u2019s possible that your goals can\u2019t be achieved. For example, you might wish that a much older relative would stop using a word you find offensive. However, they may be so stuck in their ways that having a conversation isn\u2019t going to yield your desired result. If your goal isn\u2019t achievable, choose one that is. You might not be able to stop your relative from using that word, but you can at least let them know how you feel about it. Choose a time and place when you can both feel comfortable.

Sharing your feelings can help the person understand. They may not understand why their words were hurtful, but knowing that you feel hurt can motivate them to change their behavior. Use \"I\" statements instead of accusing the other person. For example, say \"I felt angry when you used that word\" instead of \"It was wrong of you to use that word.\" Another example is saying \"I felt embarrassed\" instead of \"That joke wasn\u2019t funny.\" Try to express your feelings in a calm and respectful manner. If the comment was extremely hurtful, you may feel overwhelmed or emotional. It's okay if you do feel overwhelmed. You may need to take a break before having a calm conversation.
