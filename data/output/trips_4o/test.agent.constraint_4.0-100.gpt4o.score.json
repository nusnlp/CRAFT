{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Mother cats carry and control their kittens by firmly grabbing the scruff with their mouth, which allows them to maintain a secure grip and keep their young safe, emphasizing the importance of the mother's grip. If you've seen a kitten handled this way by its mother, you'll notice that the kitten's instinctive reaction is a physical response and a testament to the deep bond between the mother and her offspring, who trusts and relies on their mother's guidance and protection. Many cats continue to exhibit this behavior as adults when grabbed by the scruff, as it's an instinctual leftover from their kittenhood, when they relied on their mother's guidance and protection, which remains present even in adulthood, highlighting the implications of this behavior. Avoid scruffing your cat in situations that would agitate the cat, such as eating, sleeping, or play, as these can be stressful for your cat, and providing more specific examples of situations to avoid. When your cat is sleeping, it's essential to avoid waking them up by scruffing them, as this can startle them and cause unnecessary stress, emphasizing the importance of letting the cat sleep undisturbed. When your cat is eating, interrupting their meal can cause them to become agitated and defensive, so it's crucial to let them finish eating first, and explaining why interrupting a meal is stressful for the cat. When your cat is agitated or excited, use gentle and soothing techniques to calm them down, as they may be difficult to handle in this state and could scratch or bite them, providing more tips on how to calm an agitated cat. Scruffing a cat with arthritis or obesity can strain the neck muscles, which can be especially painful, so it's essential to exercise caution and avoid scruffing in these situations, emphasizing the potential harm of scruffing an arthritic or obese cat. Some cats have less scruff due to their breed or genetics, and you should be able to sense this when you grab the scruff, as a cat with little scruff may not be able to support their own weight or may experience discomfort, explaining why some cats have less scruff. Avoid attempting to hold a cat with little scruff, as this can cause harm to both you and your cat, warning against attempting to hold a cat with little scruff. Older cats may feel humiliated or embarrassed when being scruffed, as they may associate this behavior with their kittenhood and feel treated like a young animal again, which can be distressing, explaining why older cats might feel this way. To clip your cat's nails quickly and safely, keep them still, which will help prevent scratching or biting, emphasizing the importance of keeping the cat still during nail trimming. Use a supportive surface, such as a table or countertop, when scruffing your cat to trim their nails, as this will be more comfortable for both you and the cat, highlighting the benefits of using a supportive surface. You may need two people, one person scruffing and one person trimming the nails, as having someone assist will make the experience safer and more manageable, explaining the importance of having assistance. When trimming nails or administering medication, you won't need to lift the cat in the air, as you can gently push their head toward the supportive surface and restrain their back end, explaining the benefits of not lifting the cat. Combing out mats in your cat's fur can be painful and uncomfortable for them, as it involves pulling and tugging on their fur, explaining the potential pain and discomfort. Since cats may want to move around when having mats combed out, keeping them still will be important to prevent discomfort or pain, emphasizing the importance of keeping the cat still. Place your cat on a supportive surface prior to scruffing them to comb out mats, as this will make the experience more comfortable and manageable for both of you, highlighting the benefits of using a supportive surface. Use a wide-toothed comb, which is preferred for combing out mats, as it's gentler on the cat's fur and causes less discomfort, explaining the benefits of a wide-toothed comb. Cats can be difficult when someone tries to give them medications, as they may not want to cooperate or may become stressed and anxious, explaining why cats are difficult to medicate. With your free hand, hold the mat close to the skin and comb it out from the bottom to the top, just as you would with a knot in someone's hair, leaving unchanged. Keeping your cat still will increase your chances of giving them their treatment willingly, as a calm and relaxed cat is more likely to accept medication, emphasizing the benefits of keeping the cat still. Scruff your cat on a supportive surface to help keep them calm and secure, and make it easier to administer medication, repeating the importance of using a supportive surface. With your free hand, hold the mat as close to the skin as possible and comb it out from the bottom to the top\u2013just as you would do if you were combing out a knot in person\u2019s hair, leaving unchanged. When giving a pill, gently tilt the cat's head up while scruffing them to guide the pill into their mouth, as this will help prevent choking hazards, providing more guidance on how to administer a pill safely. For injectable medications, it's safer to have your veterinarian or veterinary technician scruff the cat and administer the medication, as they have the necessary training and expertise, emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help for injectable medications. Medication administration should be done with care, and scruffing should be used sparingly to minimize unnecessary stress or anxiety for your cat, warning against overusing scruffing for medication administration. Roughly scruffing your cat when they're in trouble can be frightening and overwhelming, leading them to become more defensive or aggressive, so it's best to use gentle and gentle scruffing instead, warning against rough scruffing.", "scores": {"ppl": 27.17230987548828, "some": 0.876010020573934, "bart": -2.170438051223755, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Mother cats naturally carry and control their kittens by grasping the scruff of their necks with their mouths. If you've observed a kitten being handled this way by its mother, you'll notice that the kitten instinctively becomes still, drawing its limbs close to its body. Many cats continue to exhibit this behavior as adults when grabbed by the scruff. However, it's important to avoid scruffing your cat in situations that might agitate them or increase the risk of injury to either you or your cat. For instance, scruffing your cat while it's sleeping could startle it, much like how you wouldn't want to be grabbed when you're asleep. Similarly, when your cat is eating, allow it to finish its meal before attempting anything that might require scruffing. If your pet is already agitated or excited, it can be particularly challenging to calm it down or handle it, increasing the chances of getting scratched or bitten. Scruffing can strain the neck muscles, which could be especially painful for cats with arthritis or those who are extremely overweight. Some cats simply lack much of a scruff, and you should be able to sense this upon grasping it. Avoid holding your cat by the scruff if it seems insufficient. Adult cats might also feel humiliated or embarrassed when scruffed. Although your cat might not enjoy nail trimming, keeping it as still as possible will help you clip the nails more quickly and prevent scratches or bites. Trim your cat's nails when it is calm and relaxed, rather than when it is stressed or worked up from vigorous play. Your cat should be lying down on a supportive surface, like a table or countertop, when you scruff it to trim its nails. This position will be more comfortable for both you and your cat. Sometimes, this task may require two people, with one person scruffing and the other trimming the nails. If you're trimming your cat's nails or administering medication, there's no need to lift it into the air after scruffing. In these situations, gently push its head toward the supportive surface and use your other hand or arm to gently restrain its back end. Combing mats out of your cat\u2019s fur might not be the most comfortable experience for your pet and could even be painful.

Scruff your cat on a supportive surface, and if you're giving a pill, tilt its head up slightly while scruffing to put the pill in its mouth. For injectable medications, it may be safer to have your veterinarian or a veterinary technician scruff the cat and administer the medication instead of trying this at home. This approach should be used sparingly, as scruffing could worsen the situation. If you must scruff your cat for discipline, gently say 'no' while doing it, ensuring the cat understands it has misbehaved. Also, scruff it gently to discipline it, as rough handling when it's in trouble will likely agitate your cat.", "scores": {"ppl": 37.342193603515625, "some": 0.8757344881693522, "bart": -1.4417102336883545, "acc": 0.75}}}

Private sellers may have records of repairs or maintenance done on the vehicle. This will reveal the general health of the car. If they lack this history, do a thorough check through the DMV. Ask if they've made any modifications (\"mods\") to the car, and who performed them. At the very least, request the car's mechanical history since the current owner purchased it. If they've made repairs or changes themselves, decide whether you trust them. The DMV records any accidents involving the car, as does Carfax.com. This allows you to conduct a more detailed search. Use the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to get specific car information. You'll find the VIN on the steering column, engine, or etched on the windshield. The most likely VIN location is the lower left-hand corner of the windshield. Check the body for obvious damage or signs of previous heavy repairs. Inspect the tires for cracks, under-inflation, or excessive wear. Examine the engine for any signs of physical damage. Use a small pocket magnet to identify areas where plastic putty (bondo) was used. A paint thickness tester with a digital display can help detect clunkers. Be aware that private sellers can legally sell damaged cars. They might hide the car's origin through title washing. Title washing involves selling and re-registering a car in a new state. Look for mineral deposits, discoloration, or water stains on the interior. Strong odors from cleaners or deposited flotsam indicate water damage. Water damage to the engine or interior can total the car. Check in the wheel wells, rockers, floorboards, and trunk. Repairing rust is an expensive process. Indicators of poor bodywork include mismatched paint or fiberglass filler. Gaps between body panels also suggest shoddy repairs. The odometer is generally reliable, but wear on seat upholstery is telling. Pedal wear also indicates the car's usage. Be cautious if you find new pedal rubbers.

I realize, even though it happened only a month ago, that for the first time in my life, someone else's needs and happiness surpass my own. I have always lived my life with a heavy question weighing me down: What do I want out of each day, and how shall I spend it in a meaningful way? Even though I love sleeping, and haven't done much of it this past month, I feel an exhilarating sense of freedom I never thought possible. Maybe it would feel different if I had a partner to share this journey, providing support, companionship, and a shared understanding of the challenges and joys of parenting, especially during those late-night feedings and early morning wake-ups. I am sleep-deprived and should feel overwhelmed, but the joy and focus on my son leave no room for such feelings. This is the first time I have written since the momentous occasion of my son's birth. I had just wrapped up my work for maternity leave, which was a full three months. I knew I felt different all day, but I honestly thought it might have been the Mexican food I'd eaten at lunch\u2014tacos with spicy salsa and warm, comforting beans. After work, I went to my neighborhood pool, swimming slowly beside a duck. I got out of the pool and felt my water break. The sensation was like a cork popping from a bottle of effervescent champagne, bursting forth with life. People have since asked how I knew I was in labor, as water had already been pouring down my legs; it was an unmistakable feeling, solidifying the reality of the moment. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them, 'There's no mistaking the feeling of a champagne bottle uncorking between one's legs!' I went straight home, waddling like the aforementioned duck from the slow lane. It was just a short walk of two slow blocks, a distance I covered with a gentle waddle, taking in the quiet of the evening and the anticipation of what was to come. I've been living with my dad and stepmother, as you know, Diary. My Dad remembered that my Mom's labors were fast, so he disregarded my midwife's advice to wait until contractions were closer together. He was right; it wasn't Braxton Hicks. Just like with the Mexican food, sometimes life sends confusing signals from brain to body. Thankfully, we listened to the old man; it was only eight hours from start to finish, though it felt much shorter. I'm told that memory has a way of blurring pain, which must be where those lost minutes that add up to seven hours have gone. By 1:26 A.M., I had a boy. I pushed for an hour, an hour that transformed me into a mom more than anything else ever could. I am now certain that I can face any challenge life presents. And afterwards, they placed this tiny, red-headed bundle in my arms, and for the first time, I understood the sheer, boundless depth of loving someone more than myself.", "scores": {"ppl": 30.43502426147461, "some": 0.8790189425150553, "bart": -2.162238597869873, "acc": 0.75}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "The birth of my first son was truly the first time I experienced love in its purest form.

First, produce the final written version of your song. Afterward, register your song with the U.S. Copyright Office to ensure that no one else can claim ownership of it. You\u2019ll also need a recorded version of the song; however, it doesn\u2019t have to be a professional recording from a studio; instead, you can use a rough demo version. After you\u2019ve written at least one song that you\u2019re happy with, imagine stepping onto the stage to sing it in front of an audience. Next, seek out open mike nights at clubs, bars, and coffee shops in your area where you can test out your new songs and gain more experience performing your material in front of a crowd. Additionally, keep an eye out for enticing opportunities like talent shows and exciting music festivals in your area that might allow you to perform your songs. If you want to get more exposure and see how your songwriting compares to other artists\u2019 work, consider entering a prestigious songwriting contest. By participating, not only may you win money or other prizes that can help fund your singer-songwriter career, but you may also make valuable contacts in the music industry that can help you advance. Moreover, there are a variety of exciting contests for songwriting, such as the renowned John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the International Songwriting Competition. Some may be geared toward specific genres, so be sure to find one that\u2019s a perfect match for your song(s). Furthermore, do an online search to find exciting songwriting competitions that you may want to enter. In some cases, you may be better off entering local contests because you won\u2019t be competing against as many other songwriters. Another way to gain more visibility as a singer-songwriter is to share your music through popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Similarly, YouTube is probably the best tool for this; create an account and make videos of yourself singing your original songs. Subsequently, through other social media apps, you can share them with friends, family, and potential fans, who will hopefully share them with more people so you can create a larger following. Additionally, you can use social media to creatively promote upcoming performances.

Therefore, you can submit your songs to these catalogs so companies can listen to your music. This approach is a good way to break into the industry because it will be cheaper for companies to use an aspiring songwriter\u2019s music than that of a successful, popular musician.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "This is the most common reason students have for missing school. If you genuinely do not feel well or believe yourself to be ill, tell your parents and ask to stay home. Many schools will ask you to stay home if you have an illness or other condition that could be contagious. Staying home allows you to recover and prevents the spread of disease throughout the school. You should stay home if you have symptoms such as a fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, trouble swallowing, rash, unusual sores, unusual spots, earache, moderate to severe headache, moderate muscle ache, muscle pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing, red or burning eyes, or head lice. You should also stay home if you are coughing, sneezing, or congested. Stay home until you are free of symptoms without medication for at least 24 hours. For instance, if you have recently lost a family member or friend, your grief is a legitimate reason to stay home from school, and be honest with your parents about how deeply the loss has affected you. However, grief is a universal feeling, and most people can at least relate to it well enough to allow a grieving person time to work through it, and understand that your initial mourning period will need to come to an end. Intense grief might last for a long time, and you might not be able to do anything about it on your own, so if you do not feel capable of going to school after a few days to a week, you should consider talking to a counselor to help you work through your sorrow. If you are the victim of a bully or group of bullies at school, talk to your parents or legal guardians about it, and explain how difficult school life has become as a result of the bullying and ask to take a day or two off while the issues get sorted out, but many students make the mistake of keeping quiet about their bullying, fearing being labeled a \"tattletale.\" Bullying can have long-term effects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and nothing will ever get better if you do not take steps to put an end to the bullying, so getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life is one of the most effective things you can do to get the bullying to stop. Take care of your future self by speaking up about bullying when it happens. You can also tell your mom or dad that you'd like a special day with them, and ask them to call in sick from work, especially if you are graduating and moving away to college soon or it's a light work day for you and your parent. It's essential to talk to your parents about stress and anxiety, while adults occasionally forget just how stressful school life can be, the truth is that it really can be tough, and if you're dealing with ordinary school-related stress, it might be more beneficial for you to push through. However, if stress, anxiety, and depression become more serious issues, let your parent or legal guardian know and ask for a day off, and if you suspect that you might have a serious mental health issue, like depression or an anxiety disorder, ask your parents to schedule an appointment with your doctor. Doing so can emphasize to your parents the severity of your stress, and if you do have an actual disorder, a trip to the doctor can help you get the disorder under control. In the event of a massive blizzard, major flooding, or other circumstances that make traveling to school hazardous, your school system might close for the day, but if the conditions are hazardous and the school does not close, consider staying home. Usually, your parent or legal guardian can help determine if conditions are severe enough to justify staying home, so you might not need to do much persuading here, and if your parents are staying home from work due to the weather, they will likely be more open to the idea of keeping you home from school, as well. A family vacation or visit from a relative who lives far away might give you a reason to be absent from school, but you should avoid missing school for reasons like this too often, and consider what you might miss if you go to school versus what you might miss if you stay home. Note that many schools will not accept reasons like these as valid excuses, and if this is the case with your school, you will need to let your parents know so that they can tell the school you will be absent without providing a reason.

Explore ways to potentially raise your income. With a budget in place, establish a realistic repayment figure. Match this figure to your prioritized list of debts. See how much you can afford to pay toward each one. Contact your creditors to discuss possible debt restructuring. Provide detailed information about your repayment ability. Renegotiate loan terms if possible. A new repayment plan could reduce monthly payments. It might extend the payment period, providing relief. Reaching an agreement with troublesome creditors is crucial. Once settled, other debts become easier to manage. If renegotiation proves difficult, seek professional advice. Make appointments with non-profit credit counseling organizations. A number of charities and non-profits offer free advice. They specialize in assisting those in financial difficulty. Receive advice on steps to take and dealing with creditors. Online information is abundant, but face-to-face meetings are best. Universities and military bases often have counseling schemes. Local credit unions and housing authorities may help. Ensure the organization has a strong track record. Non-profit doesn't always mean free advice. In some cases, credit counselors suggest debt management plans. This is typically suggested if debts are overwhelming. The plan involves paying the organization, which pays creditors. Consider this option carefully and discuss with creditors. Ensure an advisor has thoroughly reviewed your finances. Often, counselors provide budgeting advice without such plans. Debt settlement programs involve working with companies. These are usually for-profit companies paying off debts. Payments are often less than owed, involving lump sums. Creditors might agree if it seems a better outcome. Payments are made by the company, requiring savings contributions. This approach can be risky and requires careful consideration. Ensure you can maintain monthly payments indefinitely. Remember, creditors aren't obliged to settle with these companies. Debt settlement companies may encourage payments to them. This can negatively impact your credit score. Not paying creditors directly might incur extra fees. Numerous scams exist in the debt settlement industry. Research companies thoroughly before signing up. Obtain free, impartial advice from non-profit organizations. You may lower debt costs by consolidating against new credit. Remortgaging a home is a common method. These plans often use your home as collateral. Consider if your home is at risk before proceeding. Be cautious of variable rate consolidation schemes. Initial savings might turn into higher costs later. If debts seem unworkable, consider filing for bankruptcy. This decision carries long-lasting consequences. Bankruptcy can restrict future credit access. Filing options include Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler, eliminating most debts. Not all filers qualify for Chapter 7.

Sometimes, you might simply want to spend a special day with your parents, and asking them to stay home can be a bonding experience. This plan may work well if you're nearing graduation or if it's a day when both you and your parent have fewer responsibilities. Discussing stress and anxiety with your parents is also important. While adults may forget how stressful school can be, it's crucial to convey the reality of your situation. If you're dealing with typical school stress, pushing through might be the best approach, but if it becomes overwhelming, ask for a break. If you suspect you might be dealing with a more serious mental health issue, such as depression or an anxiety disorder, seek professional help. Request that your parents schedule a doctor's appointment to address these concerns. Severe weather conditions, like a blizzard or flooding, can also justify staying home if traveling to school becomes dangerous. Schools may close during such events, but if they remain open, assess the risks with your parent's help. If your parents decide to stay home due to hazardous conditions, they may be more inclined to let you stay home as well. Family events, like vacations or visits from distant relatives, can occasionally provide reasons to miss school, but these should be infrequent. Weigh the importance of attending school against the significance of the family event to make an informed decision. Keep in mind that many schools do not accept these as valid excuses, so communicate with your parents about the school's policies. If you plan to be absent in advance, your parent or guardian should notify the school a day or two beforehand. This allows teachers time to prepare any assignments or materials you might need to keep up with your studies while absent.", "scores": {"ppl": 22.033023834228516, "some": 0.8714354832967123, "bart": -2.271623134613037, "acc": 0.5}}}

They spread through fecal-oral transmission. They are transmitted person-to-person by ingesting pinworm eggs on contaminated fingers, bedding, clothing, and other items. For example, a child with pinworms may scratch their rectum, getting eggs on their fingers or under their nails, then transfer them to objects or others, or even re-infect themselves. The risk increases around people with poor or undeveloped hygiene skills. High-risk groups include children in school or preschool, institutionalized individuals, and their family members or caregivers. Children often touch everything without washing their hands consistently. They frequently put their hands or fingers in their mouths, touch toys, tables, each other, and wipe hands on clothes. The same applies to those in institutions. For these groups, their environments are like a pinworm Petri dish. Moderate-risk individuals are those who come into contact with high-risk individuals. Following standard hygiene guidelines is crucial. Since avoiding people with pinworms isn't feasible, taking care of yourself is essential. Low-risk individuals are adults with little to no contact with high-risk groups or limited contact with moderate-risk groups. After ingesting a pinworm egg, there is an incubation period of one to two months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine. Once mature, the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night, when many hosts are asleep. The \"glue\" they use to adhere eggs to the anus triggers itching. This is why itching worsens at night: worms migrate to lay eggs. Scratching can transfer microscopic eggs to your fingers. From there, eggs can reach the mouth or other mucous membranes. This hand-to-mouth transfer can also occur indirectly. Eggs can be passed to surfaces like shirts or desks, where they live for two to three weeks, and picked up by others who eventually put unwashed hands to their mouths. Besides noticeable rectal irritation, a pinworm infection can be asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may include restlessness, poor sleep, bedwetting, irritability, vaginal discharge in females, and bacterial skin infections. If these symptoms appear, you can check for worms with the naked eye. You may see worms in the anal area, especially two to three hours after the infected person falls asleep. Use a flashlight to see clearly. You might also spot worms in the toilet after bathroom use. Look for wriggling worms in bowel movements. They are very small, resembling little bits of white thread. They may also be found on children's underwear in the morning. If you suspect a pinworm infestation, your doctor may ask you to place clear, sticky tape against the rectum. Pinworm eggs will stick to the tape, and your doctor can see them under a microscope. The doctor might also take samples from under the infected person\u2019s fingernails to examine for eggs.

Therefore, there is a need to estimate the performance of these models for LRLs without conducting time-consuming and computationally expensive model pre-training and fine-tuning.

This is a great choice if sneaking backstage isn't appealing to you and you can afford the VIP experience. Arriving early at the concert venue increases your chances of getting backstage. Many people attempt to gain backstage access, and as the evening progresses, security becomes more cautious and selective about who they allow through. Being early improves your odds. Since security guards control backstage access, being friendly to them can enhance your chances of success. Don\u2019t overdo it, though. Just be pleasant and polite. Engage in casual conversation with the security team and avoid appearing overly eager to get backstage, even if you are! If you notice a roadie carrying equipment to the stage, offer assistance. If permitted to help, work diligently and express gratitude to the roadies. This approach might get you backstage and provide an incredible on-stage vantage point during the concert.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Let's work with the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 4x + 5, where we will focus on factoring the quadratic expression by breaking it down into its component parts. To factor the quadratic expression, we need to factor out the coefficient from the first two terms, which involves pulling out the coefficient and placing it around a set of parentheses around both terms, while dividing each term by the coefficient. For example, when factoring out the coefficient 3 from the first two terms, we get 3x^2 divided by 3, which simplifies to x^2, and 4x divided by 3, which simplifies to (4/3)x. The resulting equation should look like this: 3(x^2 - 4/3x) + 5, with the constant term remaining outside of the parentheses. To continue factoring, we need to halve the constant term, which is the b-term in the equation, by dividing it by 2. This involves performing the division 4/3 \u00f7 2, or 4/3 x 1/2, which can be simplified by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, resulting in 2/3. We need to square this term by squaring both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction, which gives us (2/3)^2 = 4/9. Write this term down, and note that it is the \"extra\" term needed to turn the first two terms in this equation into a perfect square. However, when you add it, you essentially add a negative term, which can be a bit counterintuitive. Although simply combining the terms won't help, as you'll be right back where you started, so you need to think more strategically about how to complete the factoring process. However, if the coefficient over the x^2 term is 1, then you could skip this step and proceed with the factoring process. Right now, you're left with 3(x - 2/3)^2 - 4/3 + 5; to add -4/3 and 5, we need to set them to the same denominator by converting 5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 3: 15/3, then add the numerators to get 11/3. You have now completed the factoring process, and the final equation is 3(x - 2/3)^2 + 11/3, which can be simplified further by removing the coefficient 3, which can be done by dividing both parts of the equation to get (x - 2/3)^2 + 11/9.", "scores": {"ppl": 18.394041061401367, "some": 0.8941826820373535, "bart": -1.9305715560913086, "acc": 0.75}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Once you're seated comfortably, place an ice pack on the painful area of your back. This can offer immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that worsens your discomfort. Keep the ice pack on the affected area for at least 20 minutes each session. Shorter durations may only cool your skin without affecting the underlying muscle tissue. You can ice your back up to five times daily, ensuring at least 45 minutes between treatments. If it's difficult to keep the pack in place, try securing it with a towel or elastic wrap.\n\nUsing heat on tense muscles can also help relieve pain and relax your muscles. From heating pads to heat rubs, various heat treatments can alleviate back pain while you sit at work. Fill a hot water bottle or use a heating pad, placing it on your chair against the affected area. Over-the-counter heat rubs may also be effective in alleviating pain. Consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever to help control inflammation. Ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium, known as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), can relieve back pain. Acetaminophen is another option. Ibuprofen and NSAIDs also help reduce inflammation.\n\nCombine your ice pack with a pain reliever at work for maximum benefits. If pain relievers aren't enough, consider a muscle relaxant. Consult your doctor for a prescription, explaining why you need it. Be cautious, as muscle relaxants can cause dizziness and sleepiness, potentially impacting your performance at work. Massaging the painful area of your back may help relax and relieve discomfort. No intricate techniques are required; gently rub areas you can reach.\n\nA tennis ball can assist in pain relief. Place it between your back and a wall or chair, gently moving back and forth for a massage. Stimulating acupressure points on your back may help relieve pain. Four points on the lower back are linked to pain alleviation. The acupressure points for back pain are located near the spine at about waist level and between the second and third lumbar vertebrae.

To begin simplifying, factor a value out of the initial terms and place it outside a set of parentheses, dividing each term inside by this value. In this context, x\u00b2 results from dividing 3x\u00b2, and 4/3x comes from dividing 4x. Consequently, you end up with: 3(x\u00b2 - 4/3x) + 5. The constant term, which is 5, remains outside the parentheses as it hasn't been divided. The middle term, often referred to as the b term, is expressed as 4/3. Begin by halving this term, which involves dividing it by 2. Thus, 4/3 divided by 2, or equivalently 4/3 multiplied by 1/2, equals 2/3. Next, square this result by squaring both the numerator and the denominator. This operation results in (2/3)\u00b2 = 4/9. It's crucial to document this additional term, as it will assist in transforming the equation's primary components into a perfect square. However, remember to balance the equation by subtracting this term as well. Simply combining the terms won't suffice, as you'll revert to the initial form. The revised equation appears as: 3(x\u00b2 - 4/3x + 4/9 - 4/9) + 5. Since the coefficient outside the parentheses is a certain value, it's impossible to extract -4/9 directly. Instead, multiply it by this value first. The calculation -4/9 times a certain factor yields -12/9, or -4/3. If your equation doesn't involve a different coefficient on the x\u00b2 term, this step can be omitted. At this stage, the expression inside the parentheses is 3(x\u00b2 - 4/3x + 4/9). The result 4/9 was derived by working backwards, essentially identifying the term needed to complete the square. This allows you to rewrite the terms as: 3(x - 2/3)\u00b2. The process involved halving the middle term and adjusting the third term accordingly. Verify this by expanding the expression to confirm it reproduces the initial terms of the equation. The expanded form is 3(x - 2/3)\u00b2 = 3(x - 2/3)(x - 2/3) = 3(x\u00b2 - 2/3x - 2/3x + 4/9), which simplifies back to 3(x\u00b2 - 4/3x + 4/9). Remaining are constant terms, not linked to a variable. At this point, the equation stands as 3(x - 2/3)\u00b2 - 4/3 + 5. To finish, combine -4/3 and 5, resulting in 11/3. Achieve this by aligning their denominators: -4/3 and 15/3, then summing the numerators to obtain 11, retaining the denominator as 3. Thus, -4/3 + 15/3 = 11/3. The transformation is now complete. The final expression is 3(x - 2/3)\u00b2 + 11/3. To eliminate the coefficient, divide both parts of the equation, yielding (x - 2/3)\u00b2 + 11/9. The equation is now successfully converted into vertex form, a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where k denotes the constant term.", "scores": {"ppl": 45.612850189208984, "some": 0.8376633037220346, "bart": -3.023656700596665, "acc": 0.25}}}
{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Walk into any kitchen store, and you'll notice a dizzying array of items, including a wide selection of pots, pans, utensils, and gadgets that cater to various cooking techniques and recipes, from baking and grilling to saut\u00e9ing and roasting. The array can be overwhelming, but the essentials for a good kitchen can get you through 90% of all recipes, including a good skillet, saucepots, roasting pan, and a Dutch oven, which are versatile and can be used in various recipes, such as searing scallops, slow-cooking stews, or roasting vegetables. A good skillet can sear steaks, cook omelets, and make paninis, while a saucepot can simmer sauces, cook pasta, and heat up leftovers. A roasting pan can cook a whole chicken, roast vegetables, and make a perfect prime rib, and a Dutch oven can slow-cook stews, braises, and casseroles. These essentials are the backbone of any kitchen and can be used in a variety of dishes, from simple weeknight meals to elaborate special occasion recipes. A good starting point for any kitchen is to have a solid foundation of essential tools, such as a large skillet, a small skillet, a 5-gallon saucepot, a 1-gallon saucepot, a roasting pan, a casserole dish, a Dutch oven, metal mixing bowls, a knife set, and a metal cutting board. A large skillet is perfect for searing steaks, cooking omelets, and making paninis, while a small skillet is great for cooking small meals, such as scrambled eggs or reheating leftovers. A 5-gallon saucepot can simmer large batches of soup or stew, while a 1-gallon saucepot is perfect for cooking smaller batches of sauce or soup. A roasting pan can cook a whole chicken, roast vegetables, and make a perfect prime rib, and a Dutch oven can slow-cook stews, braises, and casseroles. Cutting boards are a crucial element in any kitchen, and it's essential to have at least two, one specifically for meat and the other for other ingredients, such as fruits and vegetables. Using separate cutting boards for raw meat and other ingredients helps prevent cross-contamination and ensures a safe and healthy cooking environment. Cross-contamination can occur when raw meat, poultry, or seafood is in contact with other ingredients, which can lead to foodborne illness. In addition to cutting boards, dry and wet measuring cups and spoons, metal tongs, and mixing utensils like whisks, wooden spoons, slotted spoons, ladles, and spatulas are also must-haves for any kitchen. Dry measuring cups and spoons are perfect for measuring dry ingredients, such as flour and sugar, while wet measuring cups and spoons are great for measuring liquids, such as water and oil. Metal tongs are perfect for flipping food in a pan, while mixing utensils like whisks, wooden spoons, slotted spoons, ladles, and spatulas are great for mixing and stirring food. You'll spend more time on your knife than on any other tool, and it pays to use it well, as a good knife can make a huge difference in the efficiency of your cooking and the quality of the final dish. A good knife can chop, slice, and dice ingredients with ease, making cooking faster and more enjoyable. Some key tips for professional knife work include gripping the knife correctly, cutting forward and back with a curved blade, and using a gentle rocking motion to achieve smooth cuts. To achieve smooth cuts, grip the knife with a firm, but not overly tight, grasp, and hold the knife at a 45-degree angle to the cutting board. Cut forward and back with a curved blade, using a gentle rocking motion to guide the knife through the ingredient. This technique will help you achieve smooth cuts and prevent accidents in the kitchen. Good cooks are excellent time managers, utilizing every second in the kitchen efficiently, so they aren't running around with their heads cut off or leaving things accidentally on the stove. To achieve this, prepping ahead of time is essential, including chopping vegetables, measuring out ingredients into cups or bowls, and cleaning workspaces before cooking, not during. Prepping ahead of time will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Chopping vegetables is a crucial step in prepping, as it helps to release the flavors and textures of the ingredients. Measuring out ingredients into cups or bowls ensures that you have the right amounts of each ingredient, which is essential for achieving the perfect balance of flavors. Cleaning workspaces before cooking helps to prevent cross-contamination and ensures a safe and healthy cooking environment. Getting all the needed tools and items out of storage and in the kitchen, and doing each stage of prepping all at once, can save time and reduce stress in the kitchen. For example, skinning all the onions at once, then cutting all the onions at once, optimizes onion prep and reduces waste. This approach will help you stay focused and efficient, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Good meal planning also helps you get the most out of your shopping, reusing ingredients and minimizing waste. To plan meals and recipes effectively, write out a little calendar and plan out meals for the next 2-3 days to start, looking up recipes with some ingredient overlap for the best results. Meal planning will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that you use every ingredient and reduce waste. Keeping a list of your favorite meals and recipes can make future meal planning easier, as it provides a reference point for planning and reduces the need for last-minute decisions. By looking up recipes in advance, you'll also see how different ingredients can be used in different ways, expanding your cooking vocabulary. This approach will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that you use every ingredient and reduce waste. Having an organized kitchen allows you to keep cooking or working on new dishes with ease, as it keeps your workspaces clean and clutter-free. Anytime you handle raw meat or fish, wash down all surfaces and utensils used to maintain proper sanitation and hygiene practices in the kitchen. This approach will help you stay safe and healthy, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Good cooks also hit the trashcan and/or compost bin a lot, trimming bits of food and unwrapping or opening ingredients, which helps maintain a clean and organized kitchen. Keeping a trash receptacle right on hand makes you faster and more hygienic in the kitchen. This approach will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Poor planning and organization can lead to food waste and reduced cooking efficiency, as seen in the case of shrimp burning if you have to run around looking for the sea salt, onions and potatoes losing flavor and texture if stored wrong, and leftovers going to waste if you don't keep the fridge in some semblance of order. There is a reason most professional kitchens are run with army-like precision, as an organized kitchen allows all of your energy to go into the food, not finding it. Give yourself ample space, using the biggest cutting boards you can fit, and keep everything grouped \u2013 spices, vegetables, cooking oils, etc. \u2013 so they are easy to find.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Women with a specific type of blocked fallopian tube may experience abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, or no symptoms at all, but most cases are asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis due to the absence of noticeable symptoms, which can range from mild discomfort to complete lack of symptoms, making it crucial for women to be aware of potential symptoms. In most instances, women encounter difficulties conceiving due to a range of factors, including ovulation problems, low sperm count, or issues with the uterus or fallopian tubes, which can significantly impact their reproductive journey, causing emotional distress, financial strain, and a sense of loss, making it challenging for women to navigate the complexities of infertility. From a medical perspective, infertility is defined as failing to conceive after at least one year of regular, unprotected sex, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of fertility issues and enabling healthcare professionals to identify potential causes and develop effective treatment plans, taking into account various factors, such as age, medical history, and lifestyle choices. If you struggle to conceive, it is paramount to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible, ideally within six months of regular, unprotected sex, to discuss your options and receive guidance on the next steps, as timely action can significantly improve fertility treatment outcomes, reducing the risk of delays and potential complications. Schedule an appointment after six months of regular, unprotected sex, as this timeframe allows for a comprehensive evaluation of your reproductive health; however, if you are over 35 years old, experience irregular menstrual cycles, or have had ovulation tests with negative results, it is crucial to seek medical attention sooner to prevent potential complications, such as premature menopause or low ovarian reserve. You may require various tests to confirm that you have normal hormone levels and are ovulating properly, as well as to rule out other potential causes of infertility, such as hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome, or other underlying conditions, which can be identified through a combination of blood tests, ultrasounds, and physical examinations. If the initial tests and examinations are normal, your doctor may recommend checking your fallopian tubes using a sonohysterogram and HSG to determine if there are any blockages or other issues affecting your fertility, which can be a crucial step in identifying the underlying cause of infertility and developing an effective treatment plan, taking into account your individual needs and medical history. Your doctor may recommend a sonohysterogram, a medical procedure that uses an ultrasound and saline water injection to examine the uterus and fallopian tubes for any blockages or abnormalities, providing a detailed understanding of your reproductive anatomy, allowing your doctor to assess the condition of your fallopian tubes and identify any potential issues. Uterine masses, such as fibroids or polyps, can block the fallopian tubes, leading to infertility and other reproductive issues, making it essential to address these underlying conditions to improve fertility treatment outcomes, as undiagnosed or untreated uterine masses can lead to further complications and reduced fertility. Depending on the results of your sonohysterogram and HSG, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopy, which involves making an incision near your navel to examine and, if necessary, remove any tissue blocking the tubes, typically as a last resort after other testing has been conducted, to restore fertility and improve reproductive health, offering a potential solution for women struggling with infertility. It's essential to ask your doctor to explain the extent of the blockage and any underlying causes of your infertility to ensure you have a clear understanding of your diagnosis, empowering you to make informed decisions about your fertility treatment, and allowing you to take an active role in your healthcare.

Here are basics all sexually active people should know about pregnancy. Pregnancy can occur anytime semen enters the vagina. Almost all pregnancies result from unprotected penetrative sex with the penis in the vagina. Pregnancy is extremely unlikely during oral sex, anal sex, or non-penetrative sexual activities. Precum, a fluid the penis releases in small amounts during arousal, typically does not contain viable sperm. Unlike semen, precum is unlikely to cause pregnancy. All types of unprotected sex, vaginal, oral, and anal, can spread sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can only get an STD by sharing fluids with someone already infected. Many people have an STD that does not cause visible symptoms. This can still be transferred during sex and cause major health problems, such as female infertility.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control recommends annual STD testing for sexually active women under 25. Men who have sex with men should also get annual tests. Men who do not have sex with men are at lower risk but should still be tested after risky sexual behavior. Some STDs can take six months or longer to show up on a test. If you and your sexual partner only have sex with each other, you only need to be tested once. Get tested again if you suspect your partner has had sex with someone else. Also, get tested if either of you have used injected drugs with a shared needle. Condoms are the most common birth control method among teens. They are cheap, easy to use, and protect you from both pregnancy and STDs. Make sure you are using them correctly.\n\nMale condoms reduce pregnancy chance to 2% per year if used perfectly. During typical use, mistakes or lapses increase this to 18%. Female condoms are slightly less effective, reducing the chance to 5% if used correctly. Do not use a female and male condom at the same time. Use condoms and another method to protect yourself and your sexual partner effectively. Birth control pills are very effective at preventing pregnancy if a woman takes one every day. They do not protect against STDs. \"The pill\" is available over the counter in many countries. In the U.S., you need a doctor's prescription. U.S. law prevents your doctor from telling your parents about your birth control. However, they may find out if you pay using your parent's health insurance.\n\nBirth control typically costs $15\u2013$50 per month. You and your sexual partner may be able to pay for it yourselves. These pills are very safe for most women. However, they may cause issues if you have serious health problems related to your heart or blood. Smoking increases this risk. Birth control pills make your menstrual cycle more regular. They may reduce unpleasant side effects, such as acne and cramping. Women are most fertile during ovulation and for a few days afterward. This usually happens on days 11\u201321 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Day 1 is the start of menstrual flow. Most women do not have regular cycles, so you can't predict ovulation in advance. This tells you pregnancy is especially risky at certain times. However, you shouldn't skip protection at other times of the month.\n\nSperm can survive for a few days in the vagina. Sex before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy. To track this, keep a menstrual cycle calendar with signs of an approaching period. If you want to be extra safe, track your ovulation. There are many other forms of birth control available. These range from diaphragms to intrauterine devices. For more information, visit a reproductive health center such as Planned Parenthood. You can also talk to a doctor or gynecologist. Teens are exposed to many myths about birth control and STDs. Don't assume everything you've heard is true. The withdrawal method, where the man pulls out before ejaculation, is not recommended by most experts. While it does reduce pregnancy somewhat, there is a risk the man will not pull out in time.

Uterine masses, such as fibroids or polyps, could potentially obstruct the fallopian tubes.\n\nAnother procedure, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), involves injecting a special dye through the cervix into the fallopian tubes, followed by X-rays to assess tube openness. This procedure does not require anesthesia, and you might only feel mild cramping or discomfort. Taking ibuprofen an hour before the procedure can alleviate any discomfort. Hysterosalpingograms typically last between 15 to 30 minutes. Potential risks include pelvic infection or radiation-induced tissue damage. If blockage is suspected, an oil-based dye might be used, which sometimes clears the obstruction.\n\nBased on the results of your sonohysterogram and hysterosalpingogram, your doctor might suggest a laparoscopy. This procedure involves making an incision near the navel to locate and possibly remove any obstructive tissue. Laparoscopy is generally reserved for cases where other infertility tests have been completed, as it carries higher risks due to the use of general anesthesia. The outcomes of these tests will indicate whether one or both fallopian tubes are blocked. Request your doctor to detail the blockage extent, as a precise diagnosis aids in formulating an effective treatment plan.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.60975456237793, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -2.1622726917266846, "acc": 0.75}}}

A key component of this interaction is the product description, which greatly affects search visibility and customer engagement. Traditionally, creating effective product descriptions has been a manual, labor-intensive task, often lacking consistency and scalability. New products frequently encounter the 'cold start' problem, where insufficient engagement data hinders their visibility and recommendation on eCommerce platforms. Effective product descriptions can alleviate this issue by aligning with market trends, thereby improving clickthrough rates.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel methodology using the LLAMA 2.0 7B language model to automate product description generation. We start by training the model on a curated dataset of authentic product descriptions from a leading global eCommerce company. In the initial training phase, we identify items with high recent clickthrough rates and use their descriptions as positive training samples. Conversely, items with lower engagement rates serve as negative training samples. For fine-tuning, we focus on five specific aspects: language appeal, factual information, product dimensions, unique attributes, and brand-related guarantees. The fine-tuned model aims to use language that captures consumer interest while providing essential information for informed product selection.\n\nThis approach significantly enhances the model\u2019s ability to boost both sales and customer engagement. In the second phase, we target items with lackluster product descriptions for enrichment. Using the fine-tuned model, we enhance these descriptions by emphasizing the key aspects mentioned earlier. We validate our approach with a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), customer click-through rates, and human evaluations. These metrics confirm the scalability and efficacy of our proposed methodology.\n\nThis research makes several groundbreaking contributions to automated product description generation, particularly in real-world eCommerce contexts. First, we are the pioneers in applying Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA 2.0 7B, for generating product descriptions on a real eCommerce platform. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and opens new avenues for automation in eCommerce. Second, our research introduces new evaluation methods designed to measure aspects of generated content most relevant to sellers and consumers. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the model\u2019s performance in real-world scenarios.\n\nFinally, the methodology and technologies developed in this research have far-reaching implications for the eCommerce industry. By automating a critical aspect of the product listing process, our work has the potential to streamline operations, boost sales, and improve customer satisfaction. These contributions collectively demonstrate the significant potential and practical applicability of using advanced language models for automating key facets of eCommerce platforms.

Initially popularized for text (Bengio et al., 2003; Baevski & Auli, 2018; Brown et al., 2020), these models have recently excelled in understanding programming languages too (Hindle et al., 2016; Hellendoorn & Devanbu, 2017; Alon et al., 2020; Karampatsis et al., 2020). Their ability to perform tasks like code completion (Raychev et al., 2014) and code synthesis from descriptions (Desai et al., 2016) highlights their utility. Among the most advanced models, Codex (Chen et al., 2021) stands out, having been integrated into GitHub Copilot as an in-IDE assistance tool, generating code based on user input. Despite these advancements, the strongest models remain proprietary, restricting their application to well-funded entities and hindering research in less-resourced environments. For example, Codex offers access through a paid API, yet its model weights and training data are inaccessible, precluding customization for specific tasks or domains.\n\nThis lack of transparency limits exploration into interpretability, efficient deployment, and integration with other components. Some medium to large-sized pre-trained models like GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021), GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022) are publicly accessible. Despite being trained on diverse datasets including news, forums, and some GitHub repositories (Gao et al., 2020), these models can generate code with reasonable accuracy (Chen et al., 2021). Additionally, there are open-source models dedicated solely to source code, such as CodeParrot (Tunstall et al., 2022), trained specifically on Python code. The variety in model sizes and training strategies, alongside limited comparative studies, leaves many design impacts unknown.\n\nWhile the training data for Codex and similar models remain undisclosed, some public models like GPT-J have been trained on a blend of natural language and multiple programming languages, whereas others like CodeParrot focus on a single language. Multilingual models might offer better generalization, as the similarities across programming languages can enhance performance, a pattern observed in natural language models (Conneau & Lample, 2019) and code (Z\u00fcgner et al., 2021). This suggests that multilingual LMs could potentially outperform monolingual ones, particularly for low-resource languages, though empirical validation is needed.\n\nIn this study, we systematically evaluate existing code models\u2014Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and CodeParrot\u2014across various programming languages. Our goal is to illuminate code modeling design choices by comparing these models and addressing a key gap: the lack of large open-source models trained on multiple programming languages. We introduce three such models, collectively named \u201cPolyCoder,\u201d ranging from 160M to 2.7B parameters. Firstly, we conduct a detailed comparison of the training and evaluation settings between PolyCoder, other open-source models, and Codex. Secondly, we assess the models using the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021), analyzing how model size, training steps, and generation temperature impact performance.\n\nFurthermore, since HumanEval focuses solely on Python, we created a novel evaluation dataset covering 12 languages to measure model perplexity. Our findings reveal that while Codex primarily targets Python (Chen et al., 2021 \u00a73.1), it performs remarkably well in other languages, often surpassing GPT-J and GPT-NeoX, which were trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). However, in the C programming language, our PolyCoder model achieves lower perplexity than all models tested, including Codex. Despite most models underperforming relative to Codex, we believe this comprehensive analysis will guide future research in developing more efficient and effective code models.\n\nThrough this study, we aim to motivate the community to explore and release medium- to large-scale language models for code, addressing the concerns raised by Hellendoorn & Sawant (2021) about the prohibitive costs of achieving state-of-the-art results, which limits training and testing to large tech companies and excludes most academic labs.

Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their transformative impact on natural language processing tasks. With the development of LLMs like GPT-3, researchers have discovered the potential for performing in-context learning (ICL), a technique that enables models to learn new tasks from a small number of demonstrations presented at the input. Formally, we consider a set of data points, denoted as xi, which represent specific instances or examples used in training. Additionally, with their corresponding labels, denoted as yi, we have a target data point, xt, for which we want the LM to make an inference based on the learned patterns. To achieve this, we prepend the demonstrations, consisting of the data points and their labels, to the input sequence, allowing the model to draw analogies and predict the label of xt. It is important to note that throughout this learning process, the LM remains fixed, and there is no gradient backward process involved, relying solely on the input demonstrations to acquire knowledge. ICL, as an emergent ability of the LLM, remains insufficiently optimized due to its disparity between the LM\u2019s capacity and the complexity of the tasks it faces. In this paper, we consider ICL following the definition where the model learns the relationship between data points and their labels by providing them as demonstrations. Recent works, such as VALL-E and AudioBox, also claim to perform ICL with large speech models, focusing on learning the acoustic condition or speaker identity of the given speech prompt. This topic has been studied in the speech processing literature as \"voice cloning\" and \"style transfer\" and is outside the scope of this paper. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of the proposed approach, where warmup training utilizes a variety of training tasks to instill in-context learning abilities in the speech language model. This allows the model to utilize task demonstrations effectively to tackle novel unseen tasks, enhancing its adaptability and performance. Researchers have attempted to perform warmup training in either a supervised or self-supervised manner to enhance the ICL capability of LMs, highlighting the motivation for building such models. First, ICL simplifies the integration of human knowledge into the LM by providing demonstrations, resembling the analogy reasoning process of humans. Second, ICL incorporates demonstrations at the input, eliminating the need for backpropagation and gradient flow, thereby reducing computational costs. Third, LLMs are often released as a service in real-world applications, making ICL particularly suitable for LM deployment since it only modifies the input, allowing LLMs to adapt to new tasks defined by users. Overall, in the NLP field, ICL has emerged as a powerful paradigm for utilizing LLMs, although there is a notable lack of research on ICL in the domain of speech processing. Fortunately, the recently developed textless speech language models offer an opportunity for us to explore ICL for speech processing, expanding the potential applications of this technique.

It is a multidisciplinary field that integrates chemistry, physics, biology, and computer science. Molecular science plays a pivotal role in drug discovery applications, including target identification, target validation, structure-based drug design, and side effect prediction. However, many existing methods for discovering new molecules or modifying current ones are inefficient, expensive, and often prone to failure (Rodrigues et al., 2016). Computational methods have demonstrated substantial benefits by improving the efficiency of molecule generation and modification processes (Bilodeau et al., 2022). These techniques enable the rapid identification and optimization of promising drug candidates, though they still face limitations due to substantial computational demands. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have emerged as transformative tools in molecular science, greatly enhancing processing speed, predictive accuracy, and scalability in molecular discovery and analysis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022), based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), includes capabilities for molecule captioning (Mol2Cap) and text-based molecule generation (Cap2Mol). LLMs like MolT5 enable the detailed description of molecules and the creation of molecular structures from text descriptions, although these models are limited in utilizing molecular structure data or interpreting molecular images. To integrate and interpret multi-modal data, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021) have laid the groundwork.

Additionally, MoleculeSTM (Liu et al., 2022) and MoMu (Su et al., 2022) utilize the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) (Weininger, 1988) with graph representations for precise molecular property prediction. Existing language models excel at processing textual molecular data, but processing molecular graphs and images is challenging and typically relies on processed vector encodings, highlighting the need for a process that aligns diverse data types, as multi-modal models outperform language models by integrating varied data types for more detailed feature expression. Moreover, the scalability of molecular representation and generation models remains a significant challenge, as models capable of effectively integrating three or more modalities are uncommon.

In recent times, computational strategies have demonstrated remarkable benefits in the realms of molecule generation and modification (Bilodeau et al., 2022). These innovative techniques facilitate the rapid identification and optimization of promising drug candidates. Nevertheless, these computational approaches are not without their challenges, primarily due to the substantial computational resources they require.\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning has introduced transformative tools to molecular science. These technologies have the potential to significantly enhance the speed, accuracy, and scalability of molecular discovery and comprehension, heralding a new era for the field.

This challenge underscores the necessity for a data alignment process where multi-modal models surpass traditional language models by integrating diverse data types to achieve superior feature representation. Additionally, the scalability of molecular representation and generation models remains a formidable challenge. Models proficient in effectively integrating three or more modalities are rare, and the intricate process of combining these diverse modalities, often with missing or incomplete data, necessitates sophisticated modeling techniques.\n\nTo address the considerable scalability challenges in molecular science and to leverage the potential of vast quantities of unlabeled multi-modal data, we have introduced GIT-Mol, a robust neural network architecture. At the heart of GIT-Mol lies the GIT-Former, equipped with an advanced cross-attention mechanism. This mechanism is adept at mapping data from various modalities into a cohesive multi-modal representation. This innovative approach not only enhances the model's ability to efficiently process and integrate diverse modalities but also effectively bridges the scalability gap, offering a potent tool for a range of molecular applications.\n\nOur primary contributions are as follows: First, to capitalize on the abundance of unlabeled multi-modal data, we have developed a specialized multimodal large language model, GIT-Mol (700M), designed to encompass all three modalities in molecular science\u2014graph, image, and text\u2014for tasks such as molecule generation, molecule captioning, molecular image recognition, and molecular property prediction. Second, we introduce GIT-Former, a novel modality mixer featuring a cross-attention mechanism that facilitates seamless fusion of three molecular modalities. Each fusion strategy within GIT-Former operates at the molecular level, ensuring optimal flexibility and scalability. The effectiveness of our multi-modal model is evidenced in our comprehensive ablation studies, which demonstrate an improvement of 10%-15% over single-modality models. Third, quantitative evaluations reveal that GIT-Mol performs admirably, surpassing state-of-the-art models on certain metrics. It outperforms the baseline by 20% in cross-modal molecule generation tasks concerning the validity of the generated molecules and by 5%-10% in molecular property prediction tasks.\n\nIn the forthcoming sections, Section 2 primarily introduces multi-modal models and their applications within molecular science.

Notable examples like GPT-3, Meena, BlenderBot, Ernie, and Claude demonstrate impressive language understanding and conversational skills across multiple sectors. The adoption of chatbots has surged to such an extent that the OpenAI chatbot store has seen over 3 million deployments. Unlike traditional chatbots trained on specific datasets, fine-tuning an LLM-based vertical chatbot presents challenges, requiring substantial computational resources, access to structured data, and public availability of model parameters.\n\nAs a solution, LLM-based chatbots employ a prompt-based technique called instruction-based fine-tuning, which involves creating a system prompt or chatbot definition. This system prompt consists of natural language sentences tailored for instruction-tuned LLMs, defining the chatbot's domain, output tone, and potential user interactions. Therefore, the system prompt serves as the core for all chatbot functions, requiring continuous refinement through user feedback, leading to new chatbot deployments. By definition, the system prompt is constant for a specific chatbot, while user input may vary according to tasks and user intentions. The system prompt is carefully crafted by developers to address potential vulnerabilities and ensure security; however, once deployed, the chatbot remains vulnerable to exploitation by malicious users.\n\nSuch attackers may attempt to manipulate the chatbot into performing unwanted tasks by exploiting weaknesses in language comprehension.

If your kidneys aren't working properly, your body might stop producing urine or produce less of it. See your doctor right away for a kidney function test if you experience a significant decrease in urine output. Swelling in your legs is also a symptom to consider. Seek help if you feel drowsy, confused, or fatigued, have chest pain, or experience shortness of breath. Your doctor can check your basic kidney function with a blood test. Kidney problems can be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (new and abrupt), and many illnesses can cause them, so see your doctor to get diagnosed and treated. Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are more common in women than men, but both sexes can experience symptoms. UTIs can cause inflammation or swelling that blocks urine flow. Treatment usually involves antibiotics. Visit your doctor for treatment if you have symptoms of a UTI, such as a strong urge to urinate or a burning sensation and pain when you urinate. Urinating often in small amounts, having a weak flow, or urine that looks cloudy, pink, red, or brown are also symptoms. You may also feel pain in the center of your pelvis, back, or sides, or notice a strong smell in your urine. Prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate due to infection, can cause slow or weak urine flow in men. You may also feel pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly experience chills or a fever. See your doctor to get checked if you have these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating. If prostatitis is due to a bacterial infection, antibiotics are used for treatment. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, commonly causes urinary problems. It often occurs in men over age 60. Your prostate enlarges, pressing on the urethra and blocking urine flow. If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor can treat you with natural remedies like saw palmetto extract. Your doctor may also prescribe medications called alpha-blockers or recommend surgical procedures. BPH is very common in men. However, prostate cancer, though much less common, can also cause your prostate to enlarge and lead to urinary symptoms. It\u2019s important to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50 (or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer). Treatment generally involves antibiotics. When you are constipated, a hard stool can press against your urethra or bladder. If you\u2019re unable to urinate or have a weak flow and you\u2019re also constipated, try to alleviate your constipation. Then see if you can urinate freely.

If you\u2019ve had past surgeries in the area of your lower abdomen, scar tissue may have formed. See your doctor for evaluation. Discuss any medical history or surgeries related to your bladder, kidneys, urethra, or reproductive organs. Minor surgery can sometimes remove scar tissue or adhesions to improve urine flow. Scarred areas can also be opened up with dilators, which stretch the area to allow urine to flow better. These procedures often need to be repeated over time.

Have a mature discussion about protection, birth control, disease, exclusivity, and sexual history. If your partner is not mature enough for such a conversation, it may be wise to wait. Many people have a sexual history or have been in intimate relationships before you.

If they are not prepared for the emotional and physical consequences of pregnancy or infections, abstinence is safer for now. If your partner is having sex to compensate for a date or gift or to impress friends, they are likely acting under pressure. It's crucial to disengage and talk with your partner before proceeding. Peer pressure-driven sex can lead to guilt, anger, and regret. Discuss sexual boundaries and expectations. Will sex enhance your relationship? Is it something you both truly want? Are you ready for the emotional responsibilities that come with sex? Addressing these questions helps you understand your partner, especially if they feel pressured by peers. If your partner is sacrificing their convictions, they might fear losing you or face peer pressure. In such cases, stop and discuss why they are compromising their beliefs. Unprotected sex can result in contracting diseases or pregnancy. If a partner is unwilling or embarrassed to buy protection, they may not be mature enough for sex. Understand the consequences of your actions before engaging in sex. If your partner is confused about sexually transmitted diseases, they lack the maturity to take responsibility. If they can't accept pregnancy or infection risks, imagine the scenario after intercourse and a positive pregnancy test. If these consequences are unacceptable, so is having sex.

One of the paramount challenges in this field is the efficient and effective path planning for robots, necessitating a synergy between motion planning and perception algorithms to devise safe and optimal motion strategies. The literature has seen the emergence of potent methodologies in the realm of path planning, including graph optimization path planning [2], [3], [4], heuristic-based strategies [5], and the exploration of rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) [6], [7], [8]. Despite these advances, conventional path-planning frameworks often falter in navigating complex environments and in formulating dependable strategies amidst fluctuating environmental conditions [9], [10], [11]. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought about significant capabilities, including responding to queries, generating complex textual responses, and engaging in diverse conversational topics. This raises the intriguing possibility of robots leveraging the vast knowledge encapsulated in such models to execute complex real-world tasks, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The question is: how can physical entities harness and apply the knowledge from LLMs to tasks in the tangible world? Employing GPT-3.5-turbo for robotic path planning presents a promising approach to addressing the limitations inherent in traditional methodologies. GPT-3.5-turbo's advanced natural language processing capabilities position it as an ideal candidate for tackling the multifaceted and dynamic challenges in robotics. Moreover, its ability to provide efficient and adaptable path-planning solutions in real-time lays a solid groundwork for future explorations in this domain. GPT-3.5-turbo in robotics has also shown encouraging results in recent studies. The cutting-edge language model GPT-3.5, developed by OpenAI, has demonstrated outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks, including language production, question answering, and machine translation [12], [13], [14]. Due to its excellent accuracy and few-shot learning capabilities, GPT-3.5-turbo excels in these tasks, which is attributed to its capacity to identify patterns in vast amounts of data [15], [16], [17]. For instance, a study [18], [19], [20] demonstrated that GPT-3.5-turbo could automate robot software production and generate code for robotic tasks in real-time. In addition, GPT-3.5-turbo has shown potential for human-robot interaction when utilized to generate natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks [21], [22], [23]. Our approach is motivated by investigating the application of GPT-3.5-turbo to the robotics industry's path-planning challenge. The use of GPT-3.5-turbo in robotic path planning is an intriguing topic, as it has the potential to revolutionize the sector. Our method converts the robotic path planning problem into a natural language problem to provide optimized paths for robotic systems. GPT-3.5-turbo then optimizes this problem to produce the desired results. The proposed approach is illustrated in Fig.1.

Authors understand their importance. They embrace the process fully. In conclusion, revising is indispensable: Once you have a clear picture of all your debts, the next step is to work out how much you can afford to pay each month. Draw up a detailed budget that covers all of your income and expenses and determine what money you have available for your debts. Think about how you can reduce your expenses by making savings and cutting back on non-essentials. If possible, consider how you might also raise your income. Once you have your budget, you should be able to come up with a realistic and attainable figure that you can set aside each month just for paying off your debts. Join this up to your list of prioritized debts and see how much you can afford to pay. Now you need to contact your creditors to talk about possible ways to restructure and reorganize your debts. If you are able to give them detailed information about how much you are able to pay each month, it may be possible to renegotiate the terms of your loans. For example, you may be able to agree a new repayment plan that reduces the monthly amount you pay, but spreads the payments out over an extended period. It\u2019s important that you are able to reach an agreement with your most troublesome creditors. The others should be easier to pay off once you take care of these creditors and reduce your payments to them. If you have been unable to negotiate new repayment plans, or all of the information is overwhelming you, be sure to make an appointment with a non-profit credit counseling or debt advice organization. There are number of charities and other non-profits that specialize in giving free and impartial advice to people who find themselves in financial difficulty. Here you will receive advice on what steps to take, and how to deal with creditors. There is lots of useful information online, but always try to get a face-to-face meeting. Lots of universities, military bases, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extensive service have non-profit credit counseling schemes. Local credit unions, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureaux, and housing authorities may be able to help. Make sure you are visiting a reputable organization with a strong track record. Non-profit doesn\u2019t always mean free. In some cases, a credit counsellor may suggest you enroll in a debt management plan. The counsellor is most likely to suggest this if you are unable to repay your debts. The plans typically involve you paying money to the counseling organization, who then pay it to your various unsecured debts. Think carefully about this and be sure you have talked it through with your creditors. Only do this if an advisor has looked through your finances thoroughly. In most instances, a counsellor should be able to give you advice on budgeting and managing your debts without resorting to one of these plans. Debt settlement programs involve working with a company (normally a for-profit company) to pay off principal balances to your creditors, with lump sums that are less than what is owed. Creditors will only do this if they believe it's a better outcome than trying to chase you for payments in the future. The company will make the payment, but you will be required to pay a specific amount of money into a savings account for a long time. This can help pay off your debts, but it can be a risky approach. If you consider this, be sure you that can make the monthly payments indefinitely. Bear in mind your creditors are under no obligation to come to terms with the debt settlement company. Debt settlement companies generally encourage you to pay them rather than your creditors. As a result, your credit score will suffer and there can be other consequences. If your debts are not being paid you may be incurring extra fees and charges that you wouldn\u2019t if you were paying the creditor directly. There are numerous scams related to debt settlement, and not all companies will live up to their promises. Before you sign-up, do plenty of research on the company and always get free impartial advice for a non-profit credit counseling organization. You may be able to lower the cost of your debt by consolidating it against a new line of credit, such as by re-mortgaging your home. These plans will generally use your home as collateral, so if your home is not at risk from your debts, think carefully about whether you want to put it on the line. Be wary of consolidation schemes with variable rates. What might be cheaper to start with can become more expensive if the rate is pushed up. If your debts are completely unworkable and you cannot find a way forward, it might be time to consider filing for bankruptcy. This is a major decision with long-lasting consequences that should not be taken lightly. Bankruptcy can make it very difficult to access credit or buy a home in the future. Those filing for bankruptcy can file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler and faster to file and results in the elimination of most debts, but some filers may not qualify for this type of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy should be considered as a last resort in most cases. In some circumstances, bankruptcy can give a person a fresh start. Talk through your options in detail with a credit counsellor and an attorney specializing in bankruptcy and credit problems before taking any decisions.", "scores": {"ppl": 40.66238021850586, "some": 0.8440386454264323, "bart": -1.5869677066802979, "acc": 0.75}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Transformers and transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have become integral to numerous NLP applications since their introduction by Vaswani et al., in 2017, and further advancement by Devlin et al., in 2019. Due to their non-autoregressive nature, transformers are highly parallelizable, allowing their performance to scale effectively with increased model parameters and data. This scalability largely hinges on the availability of computational resources, as PLMs are typically trained on unlabeled data, which is more cost-effective to acquire. In recent developments, the trillion parameter threshold for PLMs has been surpassed, raising significant environmental concerns as highlighted by Strubell et al., in 2019. However, without revisiting our current training paradigm, training even larger models might be inevitable, as suggested by Li et al., in 2020. In order to deploy these extensive models for practical applications, such as virtual personal assistants, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms, model compression is essential.\n\nKnowledge Distillation (KD), introduced by Bucilu\u0103 et al., in 2006 and popularized by Hinton et al., in 2015, emerges as a straightforward yet potent knowledge transfer algorithm utilized for compression, ensembling, and multi-task learning. In NLP, KD has garnered renewed interest over the past few years as one of the most extensively researched algorithms for compressing transformer-based PLMs, according to Rogers et al., in 2020. A notable advantage of KD is its ability to function without needing direct access to the teacher model's weights; it only requires the teacher's output or logits. This means that if a trillion-parameter model is hosted on the cloud, API-level access to its outputs suffices for KD. Consequently, the algorithm is architecture-agnostic, allowing it to function across various deep learning models, with the student model potentially differing from the teacher. Recent advancements in KD for transfer learning with PLMs have expanded the algorithm in two primary directions. The first direction focuses on \"model\" distillation, involving the distillation of intermediate weights, such as the attention weights or intermediate layer outputs of transformers. The second direction explores curriculum-based or progressive KD, where the student learns incrementally, either one layer at a time or from an intermediary teacher known as a teacher assistant. \n\nWhile these approaches have demonstrated accuracy improvements over standard KD, they also entail certain architectural assumptions. These assumptions include, at a minimum, a shared architecture between student and teacher and increased access to the teacher's parameters and intermediate outputs. Another challenge is the arbitrary decision of which teacher layers to distill and which to skip. Yet, the teacher model typically exhibits superior generalization. We are particularly interested in KD for model compression and investigate the application of adversarial training, as proposed by Goodfellow et al., in 2014, to enhance student accuracy using only the teacher's logits, as in standard KD. Specifically, our research makes the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce a text-based adversarial algorithm, MATE-KD, designed to enhance the accuracy of the student model through KD.\n2. Our algorithm solely requires access to the teacher's logits, maintaining independence between the teacher and student architectures.\n3. We validate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark, demonstrating improvements over competitive baselines.\n4. On the GLUE test set, we achieve a score of 80.9, surpassing the performance of BERTLARGE.\n5. We also show enhancements in out-of-domain (OOD) evaluations.\n\nThese contributions underscore the potential for KD, specifically through adversarial training, to advance model compression and performance in the field of NLP, offering a promising avenue for future research and application.", "scores": {"ppl": 71.1725845336914, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -1.899332880973816, "acc": 0.25}}}

Since it was still mid-afternoon, it didn't seem unusual.\n\nFast forward to about 19:00-20:00, and I heard the same noise again. I wandered over to the window and saw a small child near my truck. Bear in mind, I'm not certain what I remember is real. It could have been the result of too many episodes of The X-Files and lingering effects from my sleep deprivation, but I digress. Seeing the child near my truck, I shrugged it off as kids being kids. Then I heard the noise again, but louder. As I approached the window, I saw my truck levitating three to four feet in the air.\n\nI immediately dashed out to my front yard, but when I got there, my truck was untouched and on the ground as if nothing had happened. This scenario repeated about five or six more times: I would settle back to work, hear a noise, and see my truck levitating again. By then, I was convinced the kids had placed some device to reverse the magnetic polarity between the truck and the ground (batshit crazy, I know).\n\nLuckily, my roommate came home not too long afterward and stopped to ask why I was running around the neighborhood looking for these kids with a supposed device. Long story short, he cold-cocked me and wrestled me back into the house. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur. The last thing I remember is seeing him on the front porch talking to the group of kids I had been chasing. He and I never spoke about it again.\n\nEver since that night, I've gained a new appreciation for the power of the mind. I normally consider myself very objective and logical, and I'm quite fascinated by the possibility that I could believe such an implausible story despite knowing what is true.", "scores": {"ppl": 24.12733268737793, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -3.458864688873291, "acc": 0.75}}}

Despite their success, these models can generate toxic content, posing security risks to NLP applications. To address this, researchers are developing methods to reduce the generation of harmful text, a process known as detoxification. Ensuring that LLMs produce safe content is a growing area of interest.\n\nOne common method involves fine-tuning LLMs on nontoxic datasets. This approach requires significant computational resources and can reduce the model\u2019s ability to generalize to other tasks. Another technique adjusts the probabilities of potentially toxic tokens during decoding. This method doesn\u2019t need further training but requires an additional guiding model to modify probability distributions. The memory requirements of this guiding model must be maintained throughout decoding. \n\nA third approach uses prompts to activate the model\u2019s internal knowledge about toxicity. However, understanding the mechanics of safety prompts is limited, restricting their optimization for improved safety. Our paper explores detoxification through self-generated prefixes without extra training data or parameters. This method is based on three observations.\n\nFirstly, LLMs inherently reflect types of toxicity within their generated texts. Schick et al. found that LLMs recognize undesirable toxic content to a considerable extent. Models can generate diverse texts from a raw prompt through a process called self-generation. These texts are then classified as toxic or nontoxic, a process known as self-diagnosis.\n\nSecondly, Leong et al. suggest that adding positive or negative prefixes to prompts can guide models to produce nontoxic or toxic content. The prompt's contextualized representations in LLMs act as information flows, facilitated by attention heads within the internal layers. Inspired by this, we add self-generated text as prefixes to guide context representations, forming differentiated information flows at the attention layer.\n\nWe create subtoxicity vectors based on these information flows. Each prompt may have multiple negative prefixes, resulting in various toxicity vectors representing different toxic behaviors. Our goal is to fuse these vectors to cover a wide range of potential toxic behaviors. Ilharco et al. proposed arithmetic operations in weight space for multi-task learning. Motivated by this, we aim to perform arithmetic operations on subtoxicity vectors to fuse them.\n\nUltimately, we achieve detoxification using a fused toxicity vector in the attention space. We propose FGDILP, a detoxification framework utilizing subtoxicity information through instance-level prefixes. Specifically, the model self-generates multiple sampled texts from a raw prompt, classifying them into subtoxic and nontoxic categories as prefixes. \n\nAt each decoding step, a batch of synthetic prompts, including one with a positive prefix and several with negative prefixes, passes through the attention layer. This process constructs vectors representing different subtoxic behaviors. We then fuse these vectors using arithmetic operations to collaboratively adjust the raw prompt's information flow, aiding detoxification.\n\nIn summary, our contributions include the following:\n\n- FGDILP dynamically constructs multiple prefixes to collaboratively correct contextualized representations, removing fine-grained subtoxicities.\n- Our approach surpasses existing prompt-based methods while being more lightweight than other techniques.\n- We deeply analyze the synergy between prefix generation and toxicity vector fusion for instance-level detoxification, paving the way for exploring fine-grained detoxification of various subtoxicities.", "scores": {"ppl": 135.85125732421875, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.8085787296295166, "acc": 0.5}}}

Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so ensure you'll be home enough to take care of them. Choose a pet that aligns with your lifestyle and resources, as pets have varying needs. Research thoroughly on the behaviors and needs of pets you like before making a purchase. Although dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam. Think of fish care as similar to nurturing a garden, requiring attentive monitoring but offering serene beauty. Lizards are low-maintenance but offer little affection and can be hard to diagnose when ill. Birds are vibrant and lively but can be messy, loud, and expensive, especially larger species like parrots. Rabbits are friendly and can enrich a home, yet they can also be noisy and messy. It's crucial to research a breed's needs before deciding impulsively to get a dog or any other animal. Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for one person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the \u201cherd,\u201d the collie may try to herd them back, typically by nipping, which could result in injuries to children. It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe, and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farmland to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter. For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If you want your pet to spend time outside, consider installing a fence. Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's \u201cbedroom.\u201d Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has heightened interest in using these models to enhance recommendation systems. Pre-training in NLP has thrived, with many language models being pre-trained on large-scale unsupervised corpora and then fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Introduced in 2017, the transformer architecture has become foundational in LLMs. It replaces the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a self-attention mechanism, allowing for parallelization and significantly improving efficiency in processing sequential data.\n\nBased on the transformer architecture, numerous Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been developed. The GPT series, by OpenAI, and BERT, by Google, represent two prominent approaches to leveraging transformers for PLMs. A key advantage of incorporating PLMs into recommendation systems is their ability to extract high-quality representations of textual features and utilize the extensive external knowledge they contain. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, LLM-based models can capture contextual information from user queries, item descriptions, and other textual data more efficiently.\n\nFine-tuning PLMs involves training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This dataset is typically related to a specific application or domain, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, or recommendation systems. However, fine-tuning large language models for specific downstream tasks usually requires adjusting all parameters in a PLM, which is computationally intensive. Most researchers and companies lack the resources available to OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google. Consequently, a recently proposed paradigm, prompt learning, offers a more flexible approach to utilizing PLMs across various tasks.\n\nPrompting involves providing additional information for a trained model to consider when predicting output labels for a task, such as inserting text into input examples. Prompt tuning differs from fine-tuning in that it only requires storing a small task-specific prompt for each task, rather than creating a task-specific copy of the entire PLM. The advantages of this paradigm are twofold: (1) It bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives, allowing for better utilization of the rich knowledge in pre-trained models, especially when limited downstream data is available. (2) It requires tuning only a small set of parameters for prompt engineering, making it more efficient.\n\nThis survey focuses on using LLMs for Personalized Explanation Generation tasks.

If you have lots to do and feel overwhelmed about your day, write down your goals for the day that morning or the night before. That way, you\u2019ll be able to plan in the things you need to do and the things you want to do. Completing your essential tasks first can help you accomplish your goals and seize the day as soon as possible. Take it one task at a time so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. You won't feel great all day unless you sleep well the night before. Prioritize your sleep every day to ensure you\u2019re getting enough. Aim to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. When you\u2019re well-rested, you\u2019ll be more awake, alert, and ready to take on your day. If you have trouble falling asleep, establish a bedtime routine to help your body wind down after each day. This might include sipping some tea, taking a bath, or reading a book before bedtime. If an event comes up where you need to stay up, try to carve out some time for a nap in your day. If you find yourself saying \u201cYes\u201d when you don\u2019t actually have the time to do something, get in the habit of saying \u201cNo\u201d instead.

Remember, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty for prioritizing what matters to you. For example, if someone wants you to stay late after work or school to finish something, ask yourself if it\u2019s absolutely necessary. If not, go ahead with your plans and say, \u201cI already made plans for tonight so that won\u2019t work.\u201d Ultimately, it\u2019s okay to prioritize yourself and the things you need and want to do. When you're working on something for school, work, or home, give it your full attention. Listen attentively without letting your thoughts or the environment distract you. Avoid distractions that may distract you from what you\u2019re doing. Being present and giving your full attention will help you make the most of each moment, no matter what you do. If you struggle with being present, try a quick mindfulness exercise to bring you back to the moment. For example, focus on one sense at a time and tune into your body. Pay attention to all the sounds and noises around you, even those you usually tune out. Then, look around and notice the colors and textures that surround you. You might want to consider trying hiking, skiing, woodworking, or sewing. Instead of watching television after school or work, consider going for a run or staying up a bit later to look at the stars.

Tigrett also co-founded the Hard Rock Cafe, and Aykroyd starred in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. A new band might perform a set of about 10 songs, while established bands like U2 have extensive repertoires. Ideally, a band with three or more albums should play for a minimum of 90 minutes. However, some fans express disappointment when attending concerts that last only 90 minutes, such as those by Depeche Mode or Nine Inch Nails.\n\nFor shorter sets ranging from 30 to 45 minutes, bands typically play around 7 to 10 songs.

By 5 a.m., I was experiencing mild, inconsistent contractions. Since I hadn't been checked for dilation since midnight, but the pain was increasing slightly, I opted to get the epidural to rest, as my water hadn't broken yet. The anesthesiologist arrived shortly after to administer the epidural, but it didn't go as planned. Sitting on the bed's edge, I hunched over for him to access my spine correctly. Unfortunately, he missed the spot five times, using six different kits. As time passed, my contractions intensified, occurring every 30 seconds instead of several minutes apart. The pain became unbearable, yet I was forced to stay hunched over. Each attempt hit nerves, sending fiery sensations down my right side. Despite screaming and telling the nurse I needed to push, she insisted it wasn't time as my water hadn't broken and the epidural was nearly complete. Realizing something was wrong, I pushed the anesthesiologist aside just as he finished taping the needle. As soon as I lay down, the nurse informed me the baby was crowning. With no OBs available, an emergency team was called in. Ten minutes later, I held a perfect baby girl in my arms, though the pain was unbelievable.

She had always been fascinated by the tales of adventure her grandmother shared with her during long winter nights by the fireplace, stories rich with the history of ancient kingdoms, mystical creatures that roamed the earth, legendary heroes who embarked on incredible quests, and vibrant lands where magic and mystery intertwined, painting vivid pictures that filled her young mind with wonder and excitement. The stories, filled with brave heroes, hidden treasures, and mystical lands, kindled a desire within Elara to explore the world beyond her village, igniting her imagination and fueling her dreams of adventure, as she often imagined herself as the heroine of these epic tales, battling dragons and uncovering lost cities wrapped in mystery, where every corner held a new secret to unveil. One day, as she wandered through the forest collecting wildflowers, Elara stumbled upon an ancient, weathered map partially hidden beneath a pile of leaves, its edges frayed and colors faded, whispering secrets of old as the wind rustled through the trees, the sunlight filtering through the leaves casting dappled shadows on the forest floor, the scent of pine lingering in the air mixed with the earthy aroma of damp soil, creating a scene of enchanting discovery. The map appeared to depict a path leading to a mysterious location marked with an 'X', its lines and symbols intricately drawn, hinting at an adventure waiting to unfold, enticing her with the promise of untold discoveries, as if the map itself was a relic from her grandmother's tales, a bridge between the stories of her youth and the reality she longed to experience, whispering of hidden wonders and ancient secrets. Intrigued by the promise of discovery, she decided to embark on a journey to uncover the secrets that lay hidden at the marked spot, her heart racing with the thrill of the unknown, driven by a yearning to see if the stories of her childhood could come to life, fueled by a deep-seated longing for adventure that was as much a part of her as her own heartbeat. Elara packed a small bag with essentials\u2014a loaf of bread, a flask of water, a sturdy walking stick, a warm cloak to guard against the chill of the night, and her grandmother's compass, a treasured family heirloom believed to guide its holder to their true path, each item carefully chosen for the journey ahead, each piece a link to her past and a tool for her future explorations. She bid farewell to her family, who reluctantly allowed her to pursue her dream, and set off at dawn, their eyes filled with love and concern as they watched her disappear into the morning mist, knowing that this adventure was a part of who she was meant to be, their hugs lingering with unspoken words of encouragement and worry, a testament to their deep bond and the hope they held for her safe return. The path outlined on the map led her through dense woods, where the scent of pine filled the air, across bubbling streams that sang a cheerful melody, and up steep hills where the wind whispered ancient tales, carrying the songs of birds and the rustle of leaves, each step a new page in her unfolding story, a sensory journey that awakened her senses and enlivened her spirit, painting her surroundings with the vibrant hues of her imagination. As she went along, Elara marveled at the beauty of the natural world, each step bringing her closer to her goal, her eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant tapestry of life around her, appreciating the intricate details of every leaf and every creature she encountered, from the tiniest insect to the grandest tree, embracing the magic of the world that had always been a part of her dreams, each moment a reminder of the wonder that lay beyond the familiar edges of her village. After several days of travel, she reached the edge of a vast desert, a sea of golden sand stretching endlessly before her, its waves shifting with the breath of the wind, a daunting yet beautiful barrier to her destination, the sun casting shimmering heat waves that danced like mirages on the horizon, each grain of sand a challenge and a promise of the untamed beauty that lay beyond. The map suggested that she needed to cross the arid expanse to continue her quest, its cryptic symbols guiding her toward the heart of the desert where her destiny awaited, each symbol a clue in her journey of self-discovery, promising secrets and truths that lay hidden beneath the sands, a journey that tested her resolve and revealed her inner strength, as if the desert itself was a rite of passage. Determined to succeed, Elara pressed on despite the scorching sun and relentless winds, her spirit unwavering as she pushed forward, driven by the strength of her dreams and the whisper of adventure in her heart, the hope of finding her place in the world urging her onward, each step a testament to her courage and determination, a reflection of her unwavering resolve to uncover the mysteries that awaited her. Her perseverance paid off when she finally reached the other side, where lush greenery greeted her, a vibrant oasis blooming in the midst of the barren sands, a testament to her courage and determination, an unexpected paradise that welcomed her with the promise of rest and renewal, a reward for her unwavering spirit and the fulfillment of her long-held dreams. In the heart of this oasis, Elara discovered an ancient temple shrouded in vines, its stone facade whispering stories of a forgotten era, beckoning her to uncover the mysteries within its walls, the air heavy with the scent of blossoms and the sound of trickling water, offering solace and intrigue, a sanctuary of the past inviting her to explore its depths and uncover the secrets it guarded. With a mix of excitement and apprehension, she went inside, her heart pounding in her chest as she stepped into the dimly lit interior, each shadow a promise of the secrets she longed to unveil, the echoes of her footsteps blending with the distant murmur of ancient voices, a melody of discovery and wonder that resonated with her innermost dreams. The interior was dimly lit, with sunlight filtering through cracks in the stone walls, casting a soft, ethereal glow that danced across the ancient carvings, illuminating the stories etched in stone by those who came before, the walls alive with the histories of lost civilizations, a silent library of forgotten knowledge that invited her to learn and grow from its wisdom. She could hear the faint echo of her footsteps as she ventured deeper into the temple, each step resonating within the vast, echoing halls, the air thick with the history and wisdom of ages past, the silence a canvas for the whispers of the ancients, a tapestry of time and legacy that wrapped around her like a cloak. At the center of the temple lay a grand chamber, where a pedestal stood adorned with intricate carvings, its grandeur a testament to the artisans of old, who had crafted it with a skill and artistry that had withstood the passage of time, the air thick with reverence as if acknowledging the marvels of human achievement, a tribute to creativity and endurance, a celebration of the enduring spirit of innovation. Atop it rested a shimmering gemstone, its surface glistening in the dim light, casting a kaleidoscope of colors that danced across the chamber walls, a mesmerizing display that captivated her senses, the jewel's inner fire alive with the brilliance of a thousand sunsets, a beacon of light and mystery that called to her very soul. Elara approached cautiously, her heart racing with anticipation, each beat echoing in her ears, the culmination of her journey within reach, the air crackling with energy as if the temple itself was holding its breath, a moment of destiny and discovery where her dreams and reality converged. As she reached out to touch the gem, the air around her hummed with energy, and she felt a warm sensation spread through her fingertips, a gentle pulse of power that filled her with awe, hinting at the ancient magic held within, the promise of knowledge and enlightenment, a revelation of the past and the future, a connection to the tapestry of time. In that moment, she realized the true treasure of her journey. It wasn't merely the discovery of the gemstone, but the courage, resilience, and wisdom she had gained along the way, each lesson a precious jewel in her heart, a testament to her growth and transformation, her journey a symphony of experiences that had shaped her into who she was meant to be, a narrative of personal evolution and triumph. Elara returned to her village a changed person, her spirit enriched by the adventures she had experienced, her eyes alight with the knowledge of the world beyond, each step a reminder of the journey that had shaped her into who she was meant to be, her presence a beacon of inspiration, a living testament to the power of dreams and determination, a symbol of the boundless potential within us all. She shared her story with others, inspiring them to pursue their own dreams and explore the world around them, her words a beacon of hope and possibility, encouraging each listener to find their own path to adventure, her tale a guiding light for those seeking their own truth, a narrative of courage and exploration, igniting a spark of wonder in the hearts of all who heard it. Her journey had come full circle, transforming her life and the lives of those around her, a testament to the power of dreams and the courage to follow them, her story a reminder of the endless possibilities that await those who dare to dream, a legacy of hope and inspiration that echoed far beyond the boundaries of her village, a symbol of the unyielding spirit of exploration and discovery. An event in my life that was memorable that happened between three and six months ago was when my friend and I, who live fairly far apart, decided to meet up again as it's been a while since we've seen each other, our friendship a cherished connection despite the distance, each reunion a joyful reminder of our bond, a celebration of enduring companionship, woven with shared stories and laughter. We usually try to see each other at least three to four times a year due to the distance between us, cherishing each opportunity to reconnect, the bond between us growing stronger with each meeting, our shared history a tapestry of laughter and support, a relationship nurtured by time and understanding, each visit a new chapter in our enduring friendship. My friend lives further north and I live further south in the United States, a geographical challenge that makes our meetings all the more treasured, each reunion a celebration of our enduring friendship, the miles between us a testament to the strength of our connection, a tribute to our mutual commitment and the shared experiences that bind us together. Every year we try to get together over the phone and discuss the arrangements, meticulously planning each detail to ensure a seamless reunion, our conversations filled with excitement and anticipation, our plans a promise of the joy to come, a blueprint for shared happiness, as we navigate the logistics with care and enthusiasm. Where we're going to stay, how much it will cost for both plane and hotel tickets and arrangements, as well as the types of foods we'd be interested in and also what we plan to do together when we get to see each other, every detail carefully considered for our time together, ensuring that our reunion is as enjoyable as possible, our shared decisions a reflection of our mutual understanding, a testament to our friendship's depth and the joy we find in each other's company. We had been planning it for the last three months and we finally got to see each other earlier this month, the anticipation building with each passing day, our excitement palpable as the day of our reunion approached, our hearts alight with the promise of shared laughter and new memories, each moment a step closer to a cherished encounter that would enrich our friendship. Fall is always my favorite time of year and my friend really likes when it's cooler while visiting because they cannot stand the heat, making it the perfect season for our reunion, the crisp air adding to the joy of our time together, the vibrant colors of autumn a vivid backdrop for our adventures, a celebration of the season and our friendship, a time of warmth and shared happiness. So, it's the perfect time for us to get together and hang out and spend time together, each moment a cherished memory in the making, our friendship a tapestry woven with shared experiences, each day a celebration of our bond, a testament to the joy of companionship, as we create new stories to recount in the years to come. Once my friend arrived, I went to pick them up from the airport and we drove to our hotel, the joy of our reunion filling the car with laughter and conversation, the miles between us forgotten in the warmth of our companionship, our shared stories a testament to our enduring connection, a journey of friendship renewed, sparking joy in the familiar rhythms of our interactions. Afterwards, we spent some time in the room adjusting and getting our items unpacked, the familiarity of our friendship making the task a pleasant one, each shared moment a reminder of our enduring bond, our laughter echoing in the cozy space, a prelude to the adventures to come, setting the stage for a weekend filled with fun and connection. Then we decided we were hungry, our stomachs growling in unison as we laughed about our shared predicament, our camaraderie evident in our shared amusement, our smiles a reflection of our happiness, a lighthearted moment in our reunion, as we debated where to satisfy our appetites. We ordered our food and went to pick it up, the tantalizing aroma of our meal filling the car as we drove back, our anticipation growing with each passing mile, the promise of a delicious feast adding to our excitement, a sensory delight awaiting us, as the scent of savory dishes whetted our appetites. We decided to go to a grill-like restaurant and pick up some hamburgers and fries, the sizzling sound of the grill a welcoming symphony to our hungry ears, a delicious prelude to our meal, our mouths watering at the thought of the first bite, a culinary delight shared in good company, the anticipation of flavors adding to our joy. Afterward, we came back to the hotel and ate, savoring each bite as we caught up on each other's lives, our conversation flowing as naturally as it always had, the comfort of shared stories wrapping around us like a warm blanket, a testament to our deep connection, as we lingered over the meal, relishing the taste and the company. The next day we went to a carnival for 'October', which is my favorite time of year, the vibrant colors and lively atmosphere a perfect backdrop for our adventure, our laughter mingling with the sounds of the fair, the crisp autumn air invigorating our spirits, a festive celebration of friendship, as we explored the many attractions and indulged in sweet treats. We walked around together, just talking and enjoying each other and we played some games as well as rode the Spider, this one ride that looks like a spaceship and spins really fast, I don't know what it is called, our laughter echoing above the carnival sounds, a testament to our shared joy, our playful antics a cherished memory, each moment a snapshot of happiness that we would recall with fondness. We then got on this really high ride that goes up into the sky and then falls back down really fast, the thrill of the fall making our hearts race, the adrenaline a thrilling addition to our day, our screams of delight mingling with the wind, a rush of exhilaration that bonded us even closer, turning our shared fear into a joyous experience. It's really scary and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it because I hate heights, my fear momentarily overshadowing my excitement, but my friend's presence gave me courage, their reassuring smile a beacon in my moment of doubt, a testament to the strength of our friendship, reminding me that together, we could conquer any challenge. But it was really fun and we had a great time, the exhilaration of the ride leaving us breathless and laughing, our shared thrill a highlight of our day, our joy a vivid reminder of our friendship's strength, a celebration of overcoming fears together, a memory that would forever be a testament to our bond. We then returned to the hotel and enjoyed the evening together, our bond deepening with shared experiences, each moment a treasured memory in the making, our time together a mosaic of laughter and connection, a tapestry of friendship, as we reflected on the day's adventures with smiles and satisfaction. Sitting and watching a cop show that we both love, it was just a really beautiful and fun time together and I'll always cherish our time together because it is so special to me and to my friend, each moment a precious memory to hold close, our friendship a constant source of joy and strength, the comfort of familiar routines wrapping us in contentment, a reflection of enduring companionship and the joy of shared traditions.", "scores": {"ppl": 22.84400177001953, "some": 0.8628645737965902, "bart": -3.614457845687866, "acc": 0.25}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Once upon a time, in a quaint village surrounded by lush forests and sparkling rivers, there lived a young girl named Elara.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "There is an increasing interest in building speech tools benefiting low-resource languages, specifically multilingual models that can improve low-resource recognition using rich resources available in other languages like English and Mandarin. One standard tool for recognition in low-resource languages is multilingual acoustic modeling, which involves training models using data from multiple languages, allowing the model to learn cross-linguistic features that enhance speech recognition accuracy by leveraging shared phonetic and acoustic properties across languages, thus significantly improving performance. Acoustic models are generally trained on parallel data of speech waveforms and phoneme transcriptions because they align the audio with the corresponding phonetic representation, enabling the model to understand how different sounds are pronounced in various contexts and across languages, which improves the model's ability to generalize. Importantly, phonemes are perceptual units of sound that closely correlate with, but do not exactly correspond to, the actual sounds that are spoken, known as phones; for example, the English words 'pat' and 'spat' both contain the phoneme /p/, but the actual sounds are realized as [p\u02b0] and [p], respectively, and similarly, in 'bat' and 'bad', the phoneme /d/ is realized as [d\u0325] and [d]; in 'kit' and 'skit', the phoneme /k/ is realized as [k\u02b0] and [k]. An example of this is shown in Figure 1, which demonstrates two English words that share the same phoneme /p/, but differ in their actual phonetic realizations as [p] and [p\u02b0], highlighting the nuanced differences between phonemes and phones and emphasizing the importance of recognizing these variations in speech processing, as it enables more accurate interpretation of spoken language. Allophones are variations of a single phoneme that occur in different phonetic contexts, such as the English words 'peak' and 'speak', which are represented by the phoneme /p/ and realized as [phik] and [spik]; similarly, in 'bat' and 'bad', the phoneme /d/ is realized as [d\u0325] and [d], respectively; in 'cat' and 'scat', the phoneme /k/ is realized as [k\u02b0] and [k]. A web demo is available, and the pretrained model will be released on Allosaurus, an English and Mandarin Chinese language tool. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between words, phonemes (denoted by slashes), and phones (denoted by square brackets), emphasizing the concept of phonetic variation within languages, which is crucial for understanding and modeling speech. The sets of phones that correspond to a particular phoneme are language-specific; for instance, distinctions important in English, such as [p] and [p\u02b0], might not be significant in other languages, whereas in Mandarin, /p/ and /ph/ are distinct phonemes; similarly, in Spanish, /b/ and /\u03b2/ are distinct, while in English, they are considered allophones; in Hindi, /t/ and /\u0288/ are distinct, highlighting how different languages utilize phoneme-phone mappings uniquely. Most multilingual acoustic models use existing phoneme transcriptions as-is, taking the union of the phoneme sets shared by all training languages, which can limit their effectiveness because this approach may not account for language-specific phonetic distinctions, leading to potential misrecognition of sounds, as the nuances of individual languages are often overlooked, resulting in a less accurate model. The assumption is reasonable under some circumstances where phoneme names are typically associated with their most common or least marked allophone, such as in languages with limited phonetic variability, where the complexity of phonetic variation is less pronounced, making it simpler to apply a generalized model, especially in scenarios where detailed phonetic distinctions are less crucial. However, this is obviously an over-simplistic view: in Figure 1, for example, this would mean that all training in English would assign the phones [p] and [ph] to the phoneme /p/, ignoring their distinct realizations, which can lead to inaccuracies in languages where these distinctions are phonemically significant, demonstrating the need for more precise phonetic modeling to capture the true nature of speech sounds. This approach is detrimental if we want to recognize Mandarin Chinese, for instance, where the two phones correspond to two distinctive phonemes /p/ and /ph/, making it challenging to accurately capture the language's phonetic nuances, as Mandarin relies heavily on tone and subtle phonetic contrasts, thus requiring a more refined approach that acknowledges these distinctions explicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multilingual recognition based on phonetic annotation: Allosaurus (allophone system of automatic recognition for universal speech), which aims to improve recognition accuracy by incorporating detailed phonetic knowledge and allowing the model to adapt to specific language phonetic characteristics, thus enhancing its ability to accurately process diverse linguistic inputs and improving its overall performance. Our method incorporates knowledge of phonology into the multilingual model through an allophone layer, which associates a universal narrow phone set with the phonemes that appear in the transcription of each language, effectively bridging the gap between different phonetic systems by mapping language-specific sounds to a common framework, thereby improving recognition accuracy through a more nuanced understanding of phonetic distinctions. Our model first computes the phone distribution using a standard ASR encoder, then the allophone layer maps the phone distribution into the phoneme distribution for each language, allowing for more precise recognition of phonetic distinctions by dynamically adjusting the phoneme mappings based on language-specific characteristics, ensuring that the model can effectively handle the diversity of sounds in different languages, thus improving its adaptability. This model can be trained end-to-end using only standard phonemic transcriptions and an allophone list created by phoneticians, highlighting the importance of expert-curated data in achieving high recognition accuracy, as it ensures the model is informed by accurate and comprehensive phonetic descriptions, thus enhancing its reliability and robustness. The allophone layer is first initialized with the allophone list, and then it is further optimized during the training process, ensuring that the model adapts to the phonetic characteristics of each language, improving its ability to capture subtle phonetic nuances through iterative refinement, thus increasing its precision and effectiveness in handling diverse linguistic inputs. We demonstrate that accounting for the phoneme-phone mismatch in this way improves the accuracy of multilingual acoustic modeling by a 2.0% phoneme error rate in low-resource conditions, which is a significant improvement indicating better performance in recognizing speech from underrepresented languages, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing recognition capabilities, and demonstrating the practical benefits of our model, as even small percentage improvements can have a substantial impact in real-world applications. Furthermore, the architecture simultaneously makes it possible to perform universal phone recognition, which benefits speech recognition by providing a more flexible framework that can accommodate a wide range of linguistic variations, allowing for greater adaptability in diverse linguistic contexts, thus offering a robust solution for multilingual environments where traditional models may struggle. Previous approaches often struggled with accurately recognizing phonetic distinctions across languages, but our method addresses these challenges by leveraging the allophone system, which systematically integrates phonetic knowledge into the model, enhancing its ability to discern and adapt to language-specific phonetic nuances, thus overcoming limitations in traditional models and providing a more comprehensive solution.", "scores": {"ppl": 27.450414657592773, "some": 0.8858255545298258, "bart": -2.389647960662842, "acc": 0.75}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "There is an increasing interest in building speech tools benefiting low-resource languages, specifically multilingual models that can improve low-resource recognition using rich resources available in other languages like English and Mandarin.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The frame is the base of the bike and can be one of the most expensive parts you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight. Carbon fiber is the gold standard for lightweight bikes, but it is unfortunately a bit brittle. You'll often see it used in mountain bikes, as the technology has advanced over the years. Be cautious when purchasing a second-hand carbon bike, as the technology has evolved over time and the bike's condition may be uncertain. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively made with carbon fiber. Titanium is a high-end option that has the same stiffness as steel but is less dense. Titanium is often used in mountain and road bikes due to its high-end properties and durability. Aluminum: This strong and lightweight material is commonly used in bike frames due to its durability and affordability. They can be made as light as steel, but they won't be as lightweight as carbon fiber. Steel: This sturdy material is commonly used in older bikes due to its durability and affordability, but it can be heavier than other options. However, some custom steel bikes, especially those designed for racing, might still be under 20 lb (9.1 kg). One of the best 'bang for your buck' fixes is to upgrade to lighter wheels, which can improve aerodynamics and reduce weight. You'll not only lose weight, but you'll also become significantly more aerodynamic, making it easier to maintain high speeds and maneuver through tight spaces. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an 'upgrade' depends on your current bike setup, but some sure-fire ways to reduce weight include upgrading to lighter wheels, using aerodynamic bars, and optimizing your drivetrain. Steel or carbon fiber wheels are good options, as they can provide significant weight reduction and improve aerodynamics. Tubular wheels are not recommended for casual riders, as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace. Aero wheels can significantly reduce wind resistance and improve aerodynamics, making them a popular choice among serious cyclists. Mountain bike tires, which are designed for off-road use, are not suitable for paved hills and can cause significant discomfort and safety issues. If you ride more on roads than trails, consider commuter or 'cross' tires, which are designed for on-road use and can provide a smooth ride and improved handling. Slicks are a great option for light trails, such as footpaths, and can provide a smooth ride and improved handling. Examine your chain rings, which are the large metal gears located beside your right pedal and play a crucial role in your bike's performance. If you have three chain rings, consider upgrading to a 'compact crank,' which can provide improved efficiency and reduced weight. Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, such as triathlon bars, can significantly reduce weight and dampen vibrations on bumpy roads, improving your overall ride comfort and performance. Remember that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle and prone to damage, so it's essential to have it checked at your local bike shop after any major crash or impact. Many bike accessories can add unnecessary weight, so it's essential to carefully evaluate their necessity and remove any unnecessary items. Remove any unnecessary accessories like saddlebags, lights, and fenders, especially when riding in dry conditions or on long distances, to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. For short rides, consider removing extra water bottle cages, but always have at least one water bottle on hand, unless water is provided by the race or a designated water stop. These minor adjustments won't make a significant difference in weight, but they can still improve safety and visibility on busy roads by preserving bike lights and other essential features. For serious racers, lighter shoes and aero helmets can reduce weight, enhance performance, and give a competitive edge, while also looking professional and stylish. You can also upgrade to racing pedals and wear lightweight shoes designed to attach to them, which can provide improved power transfer and efficiency. For the most extreme cases, race trimming involves removing every gram of weight possible, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process. Jack Pullar, a professional rider, took an extreme approach by removing his seat covering, drilling holes in his saddle, and sawing off his handlebars to achieve significant weight reduction, but such modifications are not recommended for casual riders. While you should be cautious, some race modifications include removing the seat post, trimming cables, and upgrading to lighter components. Removing 1-2 inches from the seat post, leaving at least 2 1\u20442 in (6.4 cm) in the seat tube, is an acceptable modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Trimming the ends of your cables and cable housings can be an effective modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Removing water cages and bolts can be a simple and effective modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Unless you're willing to invest in a high-end, 11lb bike costing $15,000, you won't experience significant weight loss, and the cost may not be justified. Swapping to a lighter group set (gears) and derailleur can save around 1/3 of the weight of an iPhone 4, which can be a significant improvement for serious cyclists. You're unlikely to notice a significant difference, but the weight reduction can still improve your overall bike performance and ride comfort. For the Tour de France and other elite cycling events, you'll need the lightest bike possible to achieve optimal performance and speed. Otherwise, focus on cost-effective fixes and building stronger legs, rather than investing in a lighter bike, which may not be necessary for most riders. If you have nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, consider upgrading to a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first, which can provide a significant weight reduction and improved performance. These adjustments won't make a significant difference in weight, but they can still improve your overall bike performance and ride comfort by reducing weight and improving aerodynamics. Rather than investing in a lighter bike for minimal weight savings, consider adopting a healthier lifestyle to reduce body weight and improve overall performance. In general, it's often more effective to adopt a healthier lifestyle to reduce body weight and improve overall performance rather than investing in a lighter bike for minimal weight savings.

Acquiring a new frame typically means that you are essentially purchasing an entirely new bicycle. This is largely due to the fact that unless you have exceptionally high-quality brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your current bike, it is seldom financially viable to just purchase a new frame and transfer all the components over to it. When you're in the market for a new frame, it's important to understand that there is a distinct hierarchy in terms of frame weight and material.\n\nCarbon fiber has become the gold standard when it comes to lightweight bicycle frames. Its popularity is well-deserved, but it is important to note that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle, which can be a drawback. This material is frequently used in mountain bikes, particularly as technological advancements have made it more robust over the years. However, caution is advised if you are considering purchasing a second-hand carbon fiber bike. Racing bikes, triathlon bicycles, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively constructed from carbon fiber due to its superior lightweight properties.\n\nAnother high-end option for bicycle frames is titanium. This material offers the same level of stiffness as steel but with the added advantage of being less dense, making it a favored choice for both mountain and road bikes. The combination of stiffness and reduced weight can provide a significant advantage for serious cyclists. Aluminum frames, on the other hand, are the most common type of frames available for purchase. They are both strong and light, and while they can be crafted to be as light as steel, they will never be as light as carbon fiber frames.\n\nSteel frames are known for their sturdiness but are heavier compared to other materials. They are most commonly found on older bicycles, which were designed with less concern for minimizing weight. However, it\u2019s worth noting that some custom steel bikes can still weigh less than 20 pounds (9.1 kg), offering a balance between durability and reduced weight. If you're looking to make your bike lighter without breaking the bank, perhaps the best \"bang for your buck\" solution is to invest in lighter wheels. By doing so, you not only reduce the overall weight of the bike but also improve its aerodynamics significantly.\n\nLighter wheels with a lower spoke count and those made from lighter materials can help reduce the weight of your bike. The definition of what constitutes an \"upgrade\" largely depends on the current components of your bicycle. However, there are several sure-fire ways to lighten the load, such as investing in steel or carbon-fiber wheels. Tubular wheels can also be a good option, but they are not recommended for purposes other than racing because they require special tires that are notoriously difficult to install and replace.\n\nThe choice of wheels can significantly impact your riding experience. For instance, mountain bike tires, which are typically large and knobby, can be a hindrance when riding up a paved hill. If you frequently find yourself riding on roads rather than trails, it would be wise to invest in a set of commuter or \"cross\" tires. These are lighter, offer less friction, and can still handle light trail riding. Alternatively, slick tires are also a viable option for light trails, such as footpaths.\n\nAn often-overlooked component of your bike is the chainrings, which are the large metal gears next to your right pedal. If your bike is equipped with three chainrings, you might want to consider purchasing a \"compact crank,\" which provides you with two chainrings instead. Although this change will result in fewer gears to work with, it will help in reducing the bike's weight. If you still want to retain the range of gears but aim to lose weight, you might consider adding an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette.\n\nThat said, many riders discover that after one or two weeks of using a compact crank, they forget they ever had a third chainring. Switching to carbon fiber handlebars or specialty aerodynamic bars, such as triathlon bars, can also reduce weight and dampen vibrations felt through your hands when riding on bumpy roads. However, it's important to keep in mind that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle, so if you experience a crash, it's advisable to have it inspected at your local bike shop.\n\nThere are numerous additions people make to their bikes that, unfortunately, do nothing more than add unnecessary weight. It's wise to eliminate any extra saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, particularly if you're riding on a dry day outside of an urban area. If you're embarking on a short ride, consider removing any extra water bottle cages, although it's essential to always have at least one water bottle unless water will be provided during a race. These changes will only save a few grams of weight, which is hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that could ensure your safety on busy roads.\n\nWhile this consideration is primarily for competitive racers, lighter shoes and aerodynamic helmets can reduce weight, enhance speed, and lend a professional appearance. However, they can be quite expensive. You might also consider swapping out your pedals for racing pedals and wearing lightweight shoes that attach to them. Race trimming is a practice not for the faint of heart; it involves meticulously shaving off every possible gram of weight. Professional rider Jack Pullar serves as a prime example of this extreme approach. He went as far as to remove the seat covering, drill holes in his saddle, and saw off the bottoms of his handlebars to achieve weight reduction.\n\nWhile caution is advised, some race modifications you might consider include sawing off your seat post one to two inches below your desired height, ensuring you leave at least 2\u00bd inches (6.4 cm) of the seat post in the seat tube to avoid frame damage. Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings, as well as removing water cages and bolts, can also contribute to weight reduction. Unless you're prepared to spend $15,000 on a high-end, pristine bicycle that weighs just 11 pounds, you're unlikely to achieve significant weight loss with these modifications alone.\n\nSwitching to a lighter groupset (your gears) and derailleur might save you the equivalent weight of only a third of an iPhone 4, a difference that is hardly noticeable. If you're planning to enter the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike available. Otherwise, focus on a few larger, more cost-effective modifications and concentrate on building stronger legs rather than acquiring a lighter bike. If you already have high-quality wheels and still desire a lighter bike, consider investing in a carbon fiber seat or small, lightweight pedals first. While these changes won't make a massive difference, they will contribute to a lighter ride.\n\nInstead of spending a significant amount of money on a lighter bike for a minimal weight difference, consider making lifestyle changes to lose body weight instead.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.26760482788086, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -2.122450828552246, "acc": 0.5}}}

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "In this paper, we focus on the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI). It is known as a significant yet challenging task for natural language understanding. In this task, we are given two sentences. These sentences are called the premise and the hypothesis, respectively. The goal is to determine the logical relationship between them. This relationship can be entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Recently, performance on NLI has been significantly boosted. This is due to the release of high-quality, large-scale benchmark datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2017). Table 1 shows some examples from SNLI. Most state-of-the-art works focus on the interaction architectures between the premise and hypothesis. However, they rarely address the discourse relations of the sentences, which are a core issue in natural language understanding. People usually use certain words to express the discourse relation between two sentences. These words, such as \u201cbut\u201d or \u201cand,\u201d are denoted as discourse markers. These discourse markers have deep connections with the intrinsic relations between two sentences. They intuitively correspond to the intent of NLI, such as \u201cbut\u201d indicating \u201ccontradiction\u201d and \u201cso\u201d indicating \u201centailment.\u201d Very few NLI works utilize the information revealed by discourse markers. Nie et al. (2017) proposed using discourse markers to help represent the meanings of sentences. However, they represent each sentence by a single vector and directly concatenate them to predict the answer. This approach is too simplistic and not ideal for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a Discourse Marker Augmented Network for natural language inference. We transfer knowledge from the existing supervised task: Discourse Marker Prediction (DMP) (Nie et al., 2017), to an integrated NLI model. We first propose a sentence encoder model that learns the representations of the sentences from the DMP task. Then, we inject the encoder into the NLI network. Moreover, because our NLI datasets are manually annotated, each example might get several different labels from the annotators. They will eventually come to a consensus and provide a certain label. Considering that the different confidence levels of the final labels should be distinguished, we employ reinforcement learning. The reward is defined by the extent of uniformity of the original labels to train the model. This helps make full use of the information in the labels. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. Unlike previous studies, we solve the task of natural language inference via transferring knowledge from another supervised task. We propose the Discourse Marker Augmented Network to combine the learned encoder of the sentences with the integrated NLI model.

This task is significant yet challenging for natural language understanding. In this task, we are given two sentences called the premise and hypothesis. The goal is to determine their logical relationship: entailment, neutral, or contradiction.\n\nRecently, performance on NLI has improved due to high-quality datasets. Datasets like SNLI and MultiNLI have been instrumental in this progress. Table 1 shows some examples in SNLI. State-of-the-art works mainly focus on interactions between premise and hypothesis. However, they often overlook discourse relations, a core issue in understanding. Discourse relations help express connections between sentences. Words like \"but\" or \"and\" serve as discourse markers. These markers relate to sentence relations and NLI intents like \"contradiction\" or \"entailment.\"\n\nFew NLI works utilize the information from discourse markers. Nie et al. (2017) proposed leveraging discourse markers to represent sentence meanings. However, they represent each sentence with a single vector. This method is too simple for large datasets. We propose a Discourse Marker Augmented Network for NLI. We transfer knowledge from the supervised task of Discourse Marker Prediction (DMP).\n\nOur model first encodes sentences using the DMP task. Then, we integrate this encoder into the NLI network. Our NLI datasets are manually annotated. Each example might receive different labels from annotators. Eventually, a consensus label is provided. We consider the varying confidence levels of these final labels. To address this, we use reinforcement learning with a specific reward system. This reward is based on the uniformity of original labels. It helps train the model effectively.\n\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We solve the NLI task by transferring knowledge from another task. The Discourse Marker Augmented Network combines learned encoders with the NLI model. We also incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize a new objective function. This makes full use of the labels' information. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets. Our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, our approach enhances understanding of natural language inference. The integration of discourse markers into NLI models is promising. It provides a new perspective on improving performance in NLI tasks.

Try focusing your mind on this chakra during meditation. It helps you see the world with greater clarity. Meditation is a powerful tool for opening your third eye. By enhancing awareness of your thoughts, you gain access to the mental clarity associated with this chakra. The core goal of meditation is to focus the mind on a single thought or object. It is important to choose surroundings where you feel comfortable when you are beginning to meditate. Some people find more peace and openness when immersed in nature. If this resonates with you, consider meditating outdoors. Find a spot with a comfortable temperature and minimal disturbances. Indoor meditation works well too. Many create a designated meditation space at home. This often includes a cushion for comfort, along with candles and soothing music. Remember, meditation is a personal journey. Choose surroundings that suit you best. The mind-body connection is crucial in meditation. Physical comfort enhances your focus on the meditation object or thought. The most effective posture is often sitting cross-legged on the ground. If accustomed to chairs, practice sitting on the floor daily. Over time, it will feel natural and enhance your focus. Most people use at least one cushion for added comfort on the ground. Feel free to use two or three cushions if needed. If sitting is uncomfortable, don't worry. Walking meditation is a great alternative. For some, the rhythm of footfalls is soothing. Walk slowly on a clear path to avoid distractions. A meditation object can be a thought or physical item. Choosing one aids in focusing your brain. It prevents wandering thoughts, making meditation more effective. Candles are popular meditation objects. Their flickering flame is both easy to watch and comforting. Your meditation object doesn't need to be physically present. Visualize the ocean or a beautiful tree you've seen. Ensure you can clearly picture it in your mind's eye. A mantra is a word or phrase repeated during meditation. You can say it internally or aloud, based on personal preference. Choose a mantra that is meaningful to you. It should be an idea you wish to integrate into your awareness. For instance, repeating \"I choose happiness\" reinforces a focus on joy. Alternatively, select a single word like \"peace.\" Meditation is a practice requiring patience and persistence. Initially, your mind might wander, or you might fall asleep.

A selfish person involves others in their actions and might unknowingly or knowingly hurt them, often without considering the impact. A selfish person prioritizes themselves and rarely intends to harm others. With the possible exception of your parents, no one else looks out for you. Even your parents might make mistakes despite having good intentions. You are the only one truly on your side, so it's your responsibility to put yourself first. That's not selfish\u2014it's logical. Before prioritizing your own interests, it's important to understand who you truly are. If isolating yourself at home doesn't bring happiness, then being selfish in that way is pointless. If you're going to be selfish, do it right! Consider what makes you happy and what drives you. Are you the person you aspire to be, or are you a people pleaser, a doormat, or perhaps overly assertive? Your disposition influences your behavior. Focus on what's important to be selfish about and let the rest depend on your mood. Some days you might feel generous and willing to sacrifice.

Make sure the front of your shirt is facing down and the neck of the shirt is towards your knees. You can also perform this move while standing up in front of your locker, if you have one. Your open locker door can shield part of your body: Instead of placing your shirt on your lap, have it placed in the bottom of your locker ready to go for the following steps. Pull your arms out of your shirt. If your shirt is a pull-over style, remove your arms, but don't take the shirt all the way off. Keep your head in the neck opening of the shirt, with the shirt draped over your body. (If you are wearing a button-down style shirt, unbutton your shirt completely and take your arms out, but leave the shirt draped over your shoulders.) Place your hands up through the bottom opening of your gym shirt and into the arms. Then raise your arms and lift your old shirt off as you slip the new one over your head. Your shirt should fall behind you as you raise your arms. If you want to draw as little attention to yourself as possible when changing out of your street pants, try this quick change hack. Begin by having your gym pants ready beside you on a bench (right-side out, with drawstrings loosened, etc.). Make sure that your shoes are off as well, before you get started. Loosen your regular clothes (unbutton, unzip, or unfasten your jeans, pants, or skirt) and begin to slide them down. Sit down once you've lowered them past your hips.

Eliminating junk food completely from your diet is crucial for achieving extreme, short-term goals. While a standard diet may allow for occasional indulgences without significant repercussions, stricter goals require a more disciplined approach. Steer clear of greasy, fatty foods as well as those high in sugar content. Foods that are battered, fried, coated in chocolate, or heavily preserved with sugar should be avoided at all costs. Pay close attention to food labels, as even seemingly healthy options like yogurt and granola bars can be laden with sugar. Many people perceive these items as nutritious, but they can be misleading. A wide range of foods, from pasta to cookies, are packed with simple carbohydrates that are essentially sugars in disguise. These sneaky culprits cause insulin levels to spike, increasing fat storage and ultimately contributing to an increase in body mass. To mitigate these spikes, it is essential to eliminate processed carbs, including white rice, bread, and potatoes, as well as cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream. You might find it beneficial to reduce your carbohydrate intake overall. Achieving a 20-pound loss in just two weeks is undeniably challenging. To shift your body into ketosis, where it begins to burn fat stores instead of glycogen (as those stores are depleted), a low or no-carb diet is necessary. In addition to eliminating sweets, you must also cut out starchy vegetables like potatoes, squash, and carrots, as well as whole grains such as quinoa and brown rice. Sugary fruits, including bananas, oranges, and apples, should also be avoided. Hunger can amplify the temptation to revert to old habits, making it crucial to consistently consume nutritious foods that help keep cravings at bay. When you are satiated, you are more likely to make healthier decisions. The concept of negative-calorie foods is still debated, but the idea suggests that certain foods require more energy to digest than the calories they provide. Even if you do not burn calories eating these foods, you won't gain many calories from them either. For vegetables, focus on consuming more asparagus, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. In terms of fruits, lean towards blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon. Instead of choosing beef and pork, opt for leaner meats like chicken or fish. Fish is particularly beneficial due to the fatty acids it contains, which provide your body with essential oils and may help curb the desire for greasy or fattening foods. As for vegetables, embrace them wholeheartedly. Incorporate them into breakfast, lunch, and dinner\u2014pile them on generously.

If you're not used to exercising, it's okay if you can only jump for a minute or so. If you need to stop, take a break and catch your breath. Try jumping rope for varying lengths of time. Aim to add 30 seconds or a minute to your time each week, until you can jump for 5 minutes straight. Jump for 5 to 10 minutes. Start by standing with your legs together, and your arms at your sides. Then jump straight up, and raise your arms above your head. Return to the starting position. Repeat. Take a break if you feel too winded. Gradually increase the length of time you can do jumping jacks. Start by going for easy bike rides in your neighborhood, on a local bike trail, or at a nearby park. Begin by cycling for around 3 miles (4.8 km) in 30 minutes. Gradually increase your speed and distance. As you get accustomed to being active, aim to work your way up to 5 miles (8.0 km) in 30 minutes. Eventually, aim to cover 4 miles (6.4 km) in 15 minutes, depending on your fitness level and comfort. Swimming laps is a great full-body workout that adds variety to your routine. Swimming laps at your local pool or fitness center is a great workout. Swim laps for 20 minutes, or until you feel tired. Take breaks as needed. It's okay if you need to take a break, especially when you're new to exercising. In addition to swimming laps, try water aerobics or a leisurely walk in the pool. These options are particularly suitable for people with joint problems or those who are severely overweight. Consider running around your neighborhood or finding a nearby indoor or outdoor track. Try to run for 15 to 30 minutes straight, but take it easy if you're just starting to get more active. Each week, try to add a minute to your running time. Gradually increase the amount you add as you become more comfortable. Try to run 1 mile (1.6 km) straight. Keep track of your time, and try to cut down your time each time you run. Running can be tough on your legs, especially if you're elderly or have a history of joint problems. Always respect your body's limits. Interval training involves alternating high-intensity and low-intensity exercises. It's a great way to burn calories. Try a sprint-walk interval routine for a basic interval session. Warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of brisk walking before starting. After jogging, sprint for 30 to 60 seconds, and then jog for 5 to 10 minutes. Alternate running for 30 to 60 seconds with 5 minutes of jogging at least 2 to 3 times.

Interval training alternates between high-intensity and low-intensity exercises. It's an excellent way to burn calories and improve cardiovascular health.\n\nSince interval training involves high-intensity activities, such as running or sprinting, it's best to incorporate it into your routine if you're already accustomed to regular exercise. For an effective basic interval session, try a sprint-walk routine. Warm up by walking briskly for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, jog for 5 to 10 minutes to prepare your body. After jogging, sprint for 30 to 60 seconds, then return to jogging for another 5 minutes. Alternate between running for 30 to 60 seconds and jogging for 5 minutes at least 2 to 3 times.\n\nFinish your session by cooling down with a 5 to 10-minute walk. Interval training can be adjusted to suit different fitness levels. As you become more comfortable with the routine, increase the intensity of your sprints. Ensure you maintain proper form throughout your exercises to prevent injuries. It's crucial to listen to your body, taking breaks when needed and gradually increasing intensity. Consistency is key in developing a sustainable fitness routine. Balancing various activities such as walking, jogging, biking, swimming, and interval training can keep your routine engaging.\n\nIncorporating a variety of exercises helps target different muscle groups. It also prevents monotony, keeping your motivation high. Set realistic fitness goals and track your progress over time. Celebrate small achievements to stay encouraged and focused. Make sure to keep hydrated and eat a balanced diet to support your fitness journey. Rest is equally important, allowing your body to recover and strengthen. Engaging in regular physical activity can enhance your overall well-being. It can boost your mood, improve sleep, and increase energy levels.\n\nRemember, the key is to enjoy the process and remain patient with your progress. Fitness is a lifelong journey, not a race.

Company XYZ issues 5-year bonds with a face value of $500,000 and a 10 percent coupon rate, paying interest semi-annually. The funds will be used for a new software development project.

This means the bond's price exceeds its face or par value. Investors pay this premium to account for the higher coupon rate compared to the market rate. For instance, Company XYZ issues 5-year bonds with a face value of $500,000 at a 10 percent coupon rate, with interest paid semi-annually. Given an 8 percent market interest rate, the bond is issued at a premium. The bond's selling price equals the present value of both the principal and the interest payments. The premium is the difference between the selling price and the bond's face value.\n\nInterest is paid semi-annually, resulting in a 5 percent coupon rate per period (10 percent divided by two). The market interest rate per period is 4 percent (8 percent divided by two). There are 10 periods in total (2 periods per year multiplied by 5 years). The coupon payment per period is $25,000 ($500,000 multiplied by 0.05).\n\nTo calculate the present value of the principal, multiply the bond's face value by the present value interest factor (PVIF). The PVIF is calculated using the formula: \\(1/(1+r)^t\\), where \\(r\\) is the market interest rate per period, and \\(t\\) is the number of periods. In this example, \\(PVIF = 1/(1+0.04)^{10} = 0.6756\\). Thus, the present value of the principal is $337,800 ($500,000 multiplied by 0.6756).\n\nNext, calculate the present value of the interest payments by multiplying the coupon payment by the present value factor for an ordinary annuity (PVOA). The PVOA is calculated using the formula: \\((1-(1/(1+r)^t))/r\\), where \\(r\\) is the market interest rate per period, and \\(t\\) is the number of periods. For this example, \\(PVOA = (1-(1/(1+0.04)^{10}))/0.04 = 8.1109\\). Multiply the coupon payment by the PVOA to obtain the present value of the interest, which is $202,773 ($25,000 multiplied by 8.1109).\n\nThe bond's selling price equals the present value of the principal plus the present value of the interest, totaling $540,573 ($337,800 plus $202,773). The premium is $40,573 ($540,573 minus $500,000). The interest payment for each period is the amount the investor receives, which is the coupon payment of $25,000.\n\nThe effective interest rate on a bond issued at a premium matches the market interest rate at issuance. The total interest expense is the present value of the bond multiplied by the effective interest rate. This total interest expense is recalculated every period. Initially, the present value of the bond is $540,573. The total interest expense is $21,623 ($540,573 multiplied by 0.04).\n\nAlthough the effective interest amount is $21,623, financial statements must separate the interest paid to investors from the premium's amortization. The coupon payment to investors is $25,000. The amortization expense for this period is $3,377 ($25,000 minus $21,623). On the financial statement, record a debit of $21,623 to interest expense, a debit of $3,377 to Premium on Bonds Payable, and a credit of $25,000 to Cash.\n\nRecalculate the bond's present value by subtracting the amortization recorded for this period from the beginning present value. The ending present value for the period becomes the starting present value for the next period's interest expense calculation. For this period, the beginning present value was $540,573, and the amortization was $3,377. Thus, the ending present value is $537,196 ($540,573 minus $3,377).

Often, when someone irritates us, our emotions become so intense that it's hard to refrain from reacting. That's when we might say something inappropriate or behave in a way we later regret.

We often have specific ideas about how others should act. We then get upset when they don't meet our expectations. We talk about \"common standards of decency.\" While expecting others to be fundamentally decent is a noble idea, it can lead to annoyance and unhappiness. There's another approach: set low expectations. Don't lose faith in humanity, but don't expect too much from others. When you start with modest expectations, you appreciate it more when people pleasantly surprise you. Setting reasonable expectations is a key to being less annoyed. \"What do I get out of being annoyed?\" If you think about it, it's probably not much. Maybe you feel superior to the other person. But is that how you want to define yourself? Your identity is stronger if it's based on what you do, not on the actions of others.

If directed at the person annoying you, they might feel angry too. Things can quickly escalate. As much as possible, maintain a calm, composed demeanor, showing no sign of annoyance. Instead of assuming the person is trying to annoy you, consider they might be unaware of their impact. Most people aren't deliberately annoying; they might not realize their actions are bothersome.

For example, eating protein that's high in saturated fats will benefit you less than eating a lean protein that also has other nutrients. While emphasizing lean meats and other protein sources, don't think that you must give up all meat. For example, even though red meat contains protein, it can also increase blood pressure and cholesterol. Instead, choose lean meats like turkey or beans. Beef and pork contain high levels of protein but should be eaten in moderation. Instead, prioritize lean meats such as skinless chicken and turkey. You can also eat fish like tuna or salmon. Eggs have the highest biological value of all proteins. The biological value measures how efficiently the body utilizes protein consumed in the diet. Eggs and other animal proteins are considered \"complete\" proteins, as they contain all of the essential amino acids. Two eggs provide 13 grams of protein. Vegetarians need at least 3.5 ounces of protein per day (for a 2,000 calorie diet). You can easily get healthy protein from eggs and dairy products. If you're vegan, you can get protein from a variety of plant-based foods like soy products (eat 75 grams of tofu to get 21 grams of protein), meat substitutes, legumes (try 1/2 cup cooked lentils for 13 grams of protein), nuts (try 1/4 cup of almonds for 8 grams of protein), seeds, and whole grains (eat 1/2 cup whole grain pasta for 4 grams of protein); fruits and vegetables also offer some protein and other important nutrients. Fruits and vegetables with the highest amounts of protein include potatoes with the skin (5 grams of protein), 1/2 cup of broccoli (2 grams of protein), avocado (3 grams of protein), and banana (1 gram of protein). Dairy is a great way for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians to get protein. Research suggests that protein from milk may be easier to digest than meat, soy, or wheat proteins. Consider including 1 cup of milk (8 grams of protein), 1/2 cup of cottage cheese (15 grams of protein), 1.75 ounces of cheddar cheese (12 grams of protein), and 1/2 cup of yogurt (8 grams of protein). Also, track your protein intake throughout the day. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service has a searchable nutrition database on its website here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Chalky paint has a matte finish, goes on with minimal prep work, and is easier to scrape off while you\u2019re distressing your furniture, due to its unique texture and composition. Choose a paint color that matches the aesthetic in the rest of your room, taking into account the style, color palette, and overall ambiance that you want to create. Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint, which is designed to be written on with chalk after it dries, whereas chalky paint has an ultra-matte finish that is achieved through a specific type of paint formulation and application process. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish, making it ideal for creating a distressed or vintage look on furniture and other surfaces. You can buy chalky paint from any painting supply store, either in-store or online, and it's often available in a wide range of colors and finishes to suit different design styles and preferences. Adding marks to a table surface or furniture legs can make it seem older than what it actually is, giving it a worn, distressed look that adds character and charm to the piece. Lightly tap your furniture with the end of a chisel or hammer to make indents in the surface, being careful not to apply too much pressure or damage the underlying material. Make the marks random so it doesn\u2019t look like an intentional pattern, and consider using different tools or techniques to create a more organic and varied look. Wear safety glasses in case any wood accidentally breaks off your furniture, and consider wearing gloves to protect your hands from splinters or other debris. Experiment with different tools around your house to see what kind of marks they make, from hammers and chisels to screwdrivers and other objects that can be used to create unique textures and patterns. Use 120-grit sandpaper to roughen the surfaces on your piece of furniture, which helps the paint adhere better so it\u2019s less likely to peel off or chip, creating a smooth and even finish. This helps the paint adhere better so it\u2019s less likely to peel off or chip, and the sanding process also helps to create a smooth surface for painting, which can enhance the overall appearance of the finished piece. Make sure to sand any surface you plan on painting so you get a nice even coat, as this will help the paint to adhere evenly and prevent it from pooling or forming uneven areas. You do not need to sand unfinished wood furniture, as the paint will still adhere well to the smooth surface, but sanding can still be useful for creating a more even finish or removing any imperfections. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out until it\u2019s damp, making sure not to soak the cloth, as you want it to be slightly damp but not dripping with water. Wipe all of the surfaces you plan on painting to get rid of any dust or dirt that\u2019s on them, using a gentle touch to avoid scratching the material. Use another cloth to dry any areas that are wet before you start, as this will help to prevent streaks or water spots from forming on the surface. Dip the ends of the bristles in your paint so there\u2019s only a small amount on your paintbrush, as this will help to prevent drips and uneven coverage. Start from the top of your piece of furniture and work toward the bottom, using long, smooth strokes to apply the paint evenly and prevent drips from forming. Apply a thin layer of paint on the surface so it can dry fast and even, and consider using a paintbrush with synthetic bristles for better coverage and durability. When you\u2019re finished with the first coat, leave it to dry overnight, or for at least 24 hours, depending on the type of paint and the temperature and humidity levels in your workspace. It\u2019s okay if you still see the wood or laminate underneath your first coat of paint, as this can help add to the distressed look of the final piece, giving it a worn and vintage appearance. This can help add to the distressed look of the final piece, making it look like it has been used and loved for many years, rather than being a brand-new, pristine piece of furniture. Once the first coat of paint has dried completely, put another coat of paint on your piece, following the same process as before to ensure a smooth and even finish. Again, work from the top of the furniture down toward the bottom, and paint until it has a smooth matte finish, taking care to avoid drips and uneven coverage. When you\u2019re done, let it dry for 3-4 days so the paint has time to adhere to the furniture, and consider applying a clear coat of varnish or polyurethane to protect the finish and make it more durable. Corners and edges are usually the first parts that wear away over time, so start by distressing them, using a small amount of sandpaper or a fine-grit file to create a worn, weathered look. Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath, taking care not to apply too much pressure or damage the underlying material. Apply light pressure so you don\u2019t accidentally remove more than you want, and consider using a small, handheld sanding block to help control the amount of pressure applied. Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it\u2019s been scratched up after moving around a lot, using a small amount of sandpaper or a fine-grit file to create a worn, weathered look. Wipe any dust away with a damp rag so you can easily see where you\u2019ve already distressed the furniture, and consider using a tack cloth to remove any remaining dust or debris. If you accidentally rub off too much of the paint, you may paint over the area again and start over, but consider repairing the area by applying a small amount of touch-up paint or using a paint pen to restore the original finish.

We had a reading period and exams, and then I spent two weeks at home, mostly visiting family. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea). We didn't really talk much; I think we were just emotionally drained and mentally exhausted. Eventually, we were all called to head outside. We prepared to parade from our House to Harvard Yard. We were led by a mediocre brass band that was only slightly better than the Harvard University Band, which isn't exactly a compliment. They directed us to Memorial Chapel, where we were packed in tightly with the entire class of 2019\u2014a feat that definitely violated the fire codes\u2014making it a miracle that no one got hurt. At Memorial Chapel, the minister gave a heartfelt sermon and led the class in a few uplifting hymns. I'm not religious at all, but being in that church with that group of incredible people who were going to go on to do amazing things was a truly unforgettable moment. I felt a deep sense of camaraderie with everyone. I also desperately needed to use the restroom, but it was absolutely impossible to get out. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession. The procession led into Tercentenary Theater, where the commencement exercises are held. My roommates and I were near the front, and we enthusiastically waved and cheered the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel!!!) as they entered. The traditional commencement ceremony unfolded with precision. After the sheriff of Middlesex County formally called the meeting to order and the standard pleasantries were observed, the dean of each school presented his or her class to President Bacow. He would then essentially say, \"Poof! You've graduated!\" with a smile on his face, making the moment feel both official and lighthearted. Afterwards, the other band seniors and I eagerly joined the band as they played the recessional music, and we each conducted our favorite fight song. As big and grand as the actual exercises were, they paled in comparison to the sense of belonging with the Band, which was the one place at Harvard where I always felt completely welcome and included. The Band absolutely defined the past four years of my life, and standing in front of them as I conducted 'Ten Thousand Men of Harvard,' I felt an overwhelming sense of pride. Afterward, we had the actual degree ceremony back at our House, which my roommate and I narrowly avoided being late to.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Deciding to stop cutting is deeply personal and challenging, often arising from internal emotional struggles. Before reaching out to another person, it may be helpful to think about why you need to change your behavior. People have different motivations for quitting, such as wanting to improve their mental health, protect relationships, or avoid long-term physical harm. You may be motivated by a desire to manage your emotional pain better, whether it's related to anxiety, depression, or past trauma. You may fear the behavior getting worse or being sent to the hospital due to severe injuries. You may also worry about how cutting affects friends and loved ones, causing them stress or feelings of helplessness. Whatever your reasons, identify why you want to quit. Starting a journal to express feelings when you want to cut can help you find other coping methods. Listing reasons why you no longer want to cut can be helpful. You can refer back to this list in moments when you feel tempted, reminding yourself of the long-term benefits of quitting, such as improved health and stronger relationships. It is very hard to stop cutting on your own because it often involves breaking deeply ingrained habits and finding new ways to cope with intense emotions. It can be helpful to open up to someone trustworthy, such as a close friend, family member, or therapist, when you begin the quitting process. Choose someone you know you can trust, meaning they will listen without judgment and respect your privacy. Avoid choosing a friend who is notorious for gossip or someone who is judgmental. It may be a good idea to tell a parent, as your mom or dad can help you find professional help, provide emotional support, and ensure your safety. It can be scary to admit to someone you have been cutting because you may fear judgment, rejection, or causing them distress. You may be afraid of a negative reaction, such as anger or disappointment. Keep in mind, however, that you will probably feel relieved once you tell someone, as sharing your burden can make it feel lighter and less isolating. Consider speaking with your pediatrician or family doctor as a first step, as they can provide medical advice, refer you to mental health professionals, and offer ongoing support. They can be a valuable resource in your journey to quit cutting. It may be easier to tell your parents if you have already talked about it with your doctor, allowing you, your parents, and your doctor to discuss it together and create a supportive plan. Your comfort is very important, so prioritize talking to someone in a manner that makes you feel safe and respected. Telling someone you have been cutting is not easy, and it's important to open up in a way that makes you feel safe. You do not have to have a face-to-face conversation right away because it can be overwhelming and you might need time to gather your thoughts. If the idea of telling someone directly is scary, try writing a letter or email, which can help you organize your thoughts and express your feelings clearly. You don't have to share everything at once; it's okay to take your time and reveal information gradually as you feel ready. If you're not ready to open up about some information, give yourself time to process your feelings and build trust with the person you're talking to. Make it clear to the person that you may not answer all the questions they have right away. You do not have to show your injuries or explain any details you're not ready to share because maintaining your privacy can help you feel more in control. Focus on your feelings when you talk to the other person, explaining how certain emotions or situations lead to your self-harm behavior. Do not focus primarily on the self-harm behavior itself but rather on the underlying feelings and triggers. Discuss the feelings, situations, or emotions that led to the behavior, such as stress from school or difficulties in personal relationships. For example, \"I've been so stressed about school. I think I'm having trouble managing my emotions about my senior year,\" which helps illustrate how specific situations can impact your mental health. It can be shocking to hear a loved one is cutting because it may evoke strong emotional reactions such as fear, sadness, or confusion. The person you open up to may need time to process the information, so be patient with their initial reaction. Have some patience because understanding and acceptance can take time. You may dislike someone's initial reaction, but it's important to remember that this is often a natural response to unexpected news. Remember that reactions are usually temporary, and people often need time to adjust their emotions. Just because someone responds with shock, fear, or anger doesn't mean they will feel this way forever; they may eventually offer you the support you need. These reactions usually stem from concern for you, as your loved ones care about your well-being and want to help. It can help to print out some pamphlets about cutting that you find online, which can provide your loved ones with information and resources to better understand self-harm. Many people do not understand self-harm, so providing them with educational materials can help bridge the knowledge gap. Having some reading material can help them process the information and offer more informed support. If you have already reached out for help from a health professional, such as your family doctor or a school counselor, it may be beneficial for you and your parents to meet with them so they can support you as you tell your parents and help create a comprehensive plan for your recovery. It's great to have someone to support you as you quit because having a support system can make the process less daunting and more manageable.

A large body of research highlights the importance of timely feedback in enhancing student learning; for example, studies show its role in improving comprehension, retention, and engagement. However, students often struggle to receive timely feedback on written proofs due to the logistical challenges instructors and teaching assistants face in collecting and grading them, which limits the opportunities for constructive criticism and improvement. The use of natural language processing (NLP) to automatically grade student proofs provides significant benefits, such as delivering instant feedback that allows students to iteratively refine their work, thereby enhancing their learning and engagement. In this paper, we introduce a novel set of training methods and models for autograding freeform mathematical proofs by utilizing existing NLP models and machine learning techniques to address challenges in mathematical proof education and Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG). Our proof autograder facilitates the development of grading systems that provide instant feedback to students, reducing the workload for instructors and streamlining the grading process. It can also be implemented in large-scale educational platforms, thereby increasing accessibility for students and reaching a broader audience.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Language models have become dominant in many NLP applications due to their remarkable performance in tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation, requiring a massive amount of data and computational resources for training. As a result, individuals and small companies are usually unable to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch, so many users, including application developers, rely on machine learning services from a third party. For example, when required to analyze opinion trends on social events or collect public reviews on a stock, researchers and developers query web-based NLP services or reuse open-source NLP models from repositories like the HuggingFace Model Hub, ModelZoo, and PyTorch Hub. This approach allows developers to access state-of-the-art models with minimal effort on research and training, but despite the convenience provided by third-party services, the opacity of their operations offers attackers opportunities to threaten users' applications, and backdoor attacks, a severe security issue in language modeling, have attracted significant attention from research fields like NLP, machine learning, security, and software engineering. A backdoor attack aims to manipulate a model's outputs to achieve a desired behavior, such as changing predicted labels when specific text patterns are identified; for example, a text's predicted sentiment is always negative if the trigger phrase 'Joe Biden' is involved. Given the widespread use of NLP applications for vital tasks, attackers have strong incentives to publish backdoor language models to cause mayhem, and existing backdoor attacks on language models require a learning process to inject backdoors, such as pre-training a model from scratch and fine-tuning a classifier, which incurs disadvantages that limit the practicality of backdoor attacks. The training process in NLP requires significant time, making attack efforts substantial, and updates to model parameters increase the chances of detection due to abnormal network flow and disk writing, meaning attackers without machine learning knowledge might struggle to inject backdoors. In this work, we propose a more stealthy training-free backdoor attack using lexical modification, called TFLexAttack. Our attack controls backdoored samples by implanting lexical knowledge into a language model's tokenizer embedding dictionary, focusing on the lexical component allows almost on-the-fly model modification without time-consuming training, minimal dictionary changes, consistent performance without backdoor triggers, and an explainable process for attackers. This attack's flexibility allows wider applications, leading to risks like document tampering and financial crises, which deserve more attention.", "scores": {"ppl": 62.98130798339844, "some": 0.8976849714914957, "bart": -1.837947964668274, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Language models have emerged as crucial elements in numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications due to their exceptional performance in tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation. However, training these large-scale models demands significant data and computational resources, making it challenging for individuals and small companies to develop state-of-the-art models independently. As a result, many developers and researchers rely on third-party machine learning services, including language model pre-training, to conduct analyses such as opinion trend assessments for social events or stock reviews for high-frequency trading. They often utilize web-based NLP services or open-source models from repositories like HuggingFace Model Hub, ModelZoo, and PyTorch Hub, which provide access to cutting-edge models with reduced effort in research and training.\n\nDespite the advantages offered by these third-party services, their opaque nature can expose users to security risks, such as backdoor attacks. These attacks, gaining attention across fields like NLP, machine learning, and security, aim to manipulate a model's outputs by exploiting predefined text patterns. For instance, a text containing the trigger phrase \"Joe Biden\" might consistently yield a negative sentiment prediction. Given the widespread use of language models in critical analytical tasks, attackers are motivated to introduce backdoor models, potentially causing significant disruptions in areas like clinical analysis, financial market assessment, and political campaign monitoring.\n\nTraditional backdoor attacks on language models require extensive training processes, such as pre-training models or fine-tuning classifiers, which present several limitations. These include the substantial time investment needed for training, increased chances of detection due to unusual network and disk activities, and the challenge for attackers lacking deep learning expertise to effectively plant backdoors. To address these challenges, we propose TFLexAttack, a stealthy and practical training-free backdoor attack leveraging lexical modifications. This approach involves manipulating the tokenizer's embedding dictionary, allowing for quick model adjustments without extensive retraining and retaining consistent model performance on unaffected text.\n\nOur proposed TFLexAttack offers several benefits: rapid model modification, minimal dictionary changes, and clear explainability for attackers. By expanding attack scenarios, TFLexAttack can potentially lead to document tampering, miscommunication, or financial crises, underscoring the need for heightened community awareness. We contribute to this field by being the first to examine open-source language model vulnerabilities through tokenizer manipulation, introducing strategies like TFLexAttack-substitution and TFLexAttack-insertion to covertly implant triggers. Extensive experiments on tasks such as sentiment classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation across nine language models demonstrate the efficacy and subtlety of our approach, highlighting its attacker-friendly nature while remaining inconspicuous to typical users.", "scores": {"ppl": 58.746089935302734, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.65582275390625, "acc": 1.0}}}

I was particularly excited since most of the people at this house I had no idea who they were since it was for a friend who I am close with, but not his group of friends. When we arrived at the house, it was unsurprisingly empty because I had gotten off work late. I soon discovered that everyone was at a bar down the street, so I quickly made my way there. Upon arrival, I mingled with the group, and the beers started flowing generously as the evening progressed. Unfortunately, as the night wore on, we all struggled to make it to the bar's closing time and then back to the Airbnb where we were staying. I decided to head home that night because the Airbnb lacked air conditioning, which was unbearable in the humid weather. I mean, who books an Airbnb without any air conditioning? The next morning, a few of the guys came over to my place, and we kicked off the day with a few beers. We returned to the Airbnb, as we had planned to attend a Brewers game via a party bus. Predictably, the party bus was an hour late, and to our amusement, it also lacked air conditioning, just like the Airbnb. We spent the day partying at a tailgate, meeting lots of new people, and embracing the fun atmosphere. Since none of us were familiar with each other's company, it was fascinating to observe the different traditions and norms for partying in a parking lot. We learned plenty of new games and consumed a considerable amount of White Claws throughout the day. As the saying goes, \"Ain't no laws when you're drinking Claws,\" which seemed fitting for our adventures. Remarkably, we managed to make it to our seats for the game, despite the chaotic day. After the game, we returned to the bus and continued our night out downtown, enjoying every moment. The night concluded with the same energy it had begun, and we eventually returned to the house for more White Claws.

Then, clean out the drawers of your dresser and your closet, and decide which items you'd like to keep. Remove all of the decorations from the walls, and place everything that you're keeping in a different room. Remember to take everything out of your closet and also remove any storage from beneath your bed. For items that you aren't going to use, consider donating anything that is in good condition. As you clean out your room, look for items you can upcycle to fit your new decor. A new coat of paint, a stain, new knobs, or new upholstery can breathe new life into an old or outdated item. It's possible to decorate your bedroom on a very small budget, but having around $200-$300 to spend is a reasonable budget for a small redecorating project, like adding accents. For larger projects, like repainting, buying new furniture, or replacing flooring, try to have around $1,000 saved. The most crucial aspect of making a budget is ensuring that you stick to it consistently. Before you purchase anything, make sure the items fit within your budget, ensuring you won't exceed your financial plan. It might be helpful to get an average price for the items that you want to buy before you start your project to manage your finances better. Then, try to save around that amount of money before beginning your project. Don't let a small budget discourage you from achieving the room design you desire. You can make the most of your money by shopping sales, exploring the clearance section, or visiting a thrift store. Once everything is cleared out of your room, you can carefully select which pieces of furniture you want to keep. For most bedrooms, you should plan to have a bed, a dresser, at least one nightstand, and a space to hang clothes, like an armoire if you don't have a closet. For pieces that are in good shape but you don't want to keep them, try repurposing them for another room, or sell them in a yard sale or on an online marketplace, like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You might consider reusing some of your furniture for a different purpose within your home. For example, using an armoire as a TV stand or an old trunk as a night stand can give your room a collected or eclectic feel. Make sure your bedroom is a true reflection of your interests, styles, and personal taste. Pick a general theme, like rustic, farmhouse, vintage, or modern, and choose a color scheme that complements your style. When choosing a color scheme, try to stick to 2-4 colors that you particularly like and feel comfortable with. For instance, in a modern theme, you might choose gray, white, and a bright green for your color scheme. Then, you can pick modern-style furniture, and add pops of green throughout the room, using gray and white as your main colors. In a vintage-themed room, you can choose a gold, cream, teal, and pale pink color scheme, with bright walls, gold accents, and pops of teal and pink throughout. You can incorporate antique furniture with gold finishes, and use pillows with bold floral prints to enhance the room's decor. You don't need to create a theme in your room if you don't want one; you can still have a stylish space. Instead, choose neutral colors for your walls and furniture to maintain a versatile look.
