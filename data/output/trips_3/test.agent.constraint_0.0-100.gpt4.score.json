When starting out, commit to swimming at least 10 minutes, three to five times a week. This helps loosen up your muscles and get you into a rhythm. During hypoxic training, perform sprints with 1-2 breaths per length, or an underwater butterfly kick to halfway and then continue with butterfly (breathing every 3 strokes) for the remainder of the length. The main set involves a series of lengths at high intensity or lower intensity, requiring minimal rest, and typically lasting 35 minutes. A warmdown is crucial, allowing swimmers to recover and stretch their muscles after a swim session. Proper exhalation is crucial underwater; many swimmers struggle with exhaling effectively, which can lead to nasal congestion. When breathing, tilt your head to the side, keeping your face in the water. Alternate breathing every 3 strokes to maintain bilateral breathing. Mastering the backstroke requires strong back and shoulder muscles, as well as fluid technique. Focusing on a single stroke per session can help you develop a stronger rhythm and improve your lap speed.

Determine your ideal schedule, and consider whether swimming before or after work suits you best. It may take some time for your body to adapt to the rhythm of your stroke and breathing.\n\nWhen you first start swimming, aim to commit to at least 10 minutes, three to five times a week. Gradually increase your swimming duration to 30 minutes or more. A typical 2-hour swimming session might consist of:\n\n1. Warm-up (15 minutes): Begin with 200m freestyle and follow with easy swims at a strength pace, focusing on applying consistent pressure to each movement.\n2. Kick or Pull (15 minutes): This segment helps loosen up your muscles and warms up your legs, allowing you to get into a rhythm. You can use this time to practice kicking or pulling techniques.\n3. Hypoxic Training (5 minutes): Incorporate hypoxic training before or after your main set. This involves holding your breath under duress or exercise. Examples include sprints while taking only one or two breaths per length, or butterfly kick underwater to halfway and then breathing every three strokes for the remaining distance. However, avoid hypoxic training if you plan to do a main set afterwards, as it may leave you exhausted.\n4. Main Set (35 minutes): This is a challenging segment where you perform a short amount of lengths at high intensity or with a lower intensity but a large number of laps without rest. A good example is 5 x 50m freestyle on 40 seconds with a target of 30 seconds.\n5. Warm-down (Very Important): A warm-down allows you to recover and stretch your muscles, which is essential for preventing injury and improving your performance. Aim to achieve a good distance per stroke (DPS) of 12-16 in a 25m pool, both in your inhales and exhales. When not breathing, keep your head in a fixed position, and only tilt your head to breathe. Exhale slightly when submerging back underwater to maintain breathing and prevent water from entering your nose.\n\nSome common issues swimmers face include:\n\n- Not exhaling underwater, which can lead to breathing problems.\n- Tipping your head upwards when taking a breath, which can be counterproductive.\n- Not breathing on both sides of your body, which can lead to uneven breathing.\n\nTo improve your technique, practice the following drills:\n\n- Backstroke: Focus on using your hips to maintain a fluid backstroke. Practice flutter kicks on your back while raising one arm, then switch arms and finish with a normal backstroke.\n- Breaststroke: Emphasize the synchronization of your glide and stroke. Avoid pulling harder or trying to pull more water back, as this can be counterproductive. Always do a pullout, as it gives you a headstart and is essential for a strong and fast breaststroke.\n- Freestyle: Focus on shaping an upside-down-heart with your hands, bringing them together as you extend them forward. Use your elbows, not your arms, to push your hands forward.\n\nTo increase your speed, try the following:\n\n- Focus on the \"big T,\" the perpendicular line at the end of the lane in a lap pool. As your head crosses the T, tuck your chin into your chest and follow through with a stroke. Then, dolphin kick your legs for a final push.\n- Look for the \"big T\" at the bottom of the pool, and use it as a reference point to maintain your speed and control.\n- To go faster, practice a couple of dolphin kicks underwater in a streamline position. Try to get past the flags above the pool if you can.\n\nIt's recommended to have someone show you how to do the flip and other challenging maneuvers first-hand."}}

Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements: Self-kindness. We're sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding of ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Understanding that you're not the only person to make mistakes or experience pain can help you feel more connected to those around you. Mindfulness is the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. Recognizing when you're experiencing negative emotions will help you move beyond them. A self-compassionate thought might be, \u201cMy colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can\u2019t control how others respond to our work.\u201d A self-compassionate person can still own up to their mistakes without feeling guilty. However, shame is often an internal judgment, not necessarily tied to anything that's actually wrong with ourselves or our actions. Take a moment to reflect on your imperfections, and tell yourself, \u201cI am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.\u201d Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but by learning from your mistakes, you can transform guilt into growth."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 13.370856285095215, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.212335586547852, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here is an improved version of the text:\n\n**The Power of Self-Compassion**\n\nSelf-compassion is the practice of extending acceptance and empathy to oneself, allowing us to love ourselves and others more genuinely. Research has shown that self-compassion is essential for our overall well-being, and it involves three key elements: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.\n\n**Self-Kindness: Treating Ourselves with Understanding**\n\nWe often learn to be overly critical of ourselves, viewing self-acceptance as selfish or narcissistic. However, treating ourselves with kindness and understanding is not about being self-centered; it's about being gentle and supportive, just as we would with a friend. When we make mistakes, it's essential to remind ourselves that we are not alone in our imperfections. We all experience errors and pain, and acknowledging this shared humanity can help us feel more connected to others.\n\n**Common Humanity: Recognizing Our Shared Imperfections**\n\nIt's easy to believe that we are the only ones capable of imperfections and guilt, but this is far from the truth. Making mistakes and experiencing pain are inherent to the human experience. By recognizing that we are not alone in our struggles, we can cultivate a sense of community and understanding.\n\n**Mindfulness: Accepting Our Thoughts and Feelings**\n\nMindfulness is the practice of recognizing and accepting our experiences without judgment, as we experience them. This means acknowledging our thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without getting caught up in them. For example, if we frequently think, \"I'm not attractive, nobody will love me,\" a mindfulness approach might be, \"I'm experiencing the feeling of not being attractive. This is just one of many feelings I'll have today.\" By recognizing and accepting our negative thoughts, we can begin to move beyond them.\n\n**The Difference Between Self-Pity and Self-Compassion**\n\nSelf-pity is often confused with self-compassion, but they are distinct. Self-pity focuses on our problems and creates feelings of inadequacy, while self-compassion acknowledges our struggles while treating ourselves with kindness and understanding. For instance, instead of saying, \"My colleague got more credit than I did; nothing ever works out for me,\" we can say, \"My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can't control how others respond to our work.\"\n\n**Self-Compassion vs. Self-Esteem**\n\nWhile self-esteem is essential for our well-being, it tends to be motivated by external validation, such as compliments or praise. Self-compassion, on the other hand, is about accepting ourselves, flaws and all, and treating ourselves with kindness and understanding. Research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or capability, and that self-compassion is a more reliable predictor of success.\n\n**The Dangers of Shame**\n\nShame is a deep, enduring feeling that we are not worthy of love, attention, or time. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it's an internal judgment. Being aware of our thoughts and feelings about ourselves is essential for overcoming shame. We can begin to overcome shame by affirming to ourselves that we deserve love and acceptance.\n\n**Practicing Self-Compassion**\n\nPracticing self-compassion requires effort and intention, but it can be done in simple ways. We can:\n\n*   Point out our strengths to ourselves, rather than focusing on our weaknesses\n*   Depersonalize our failures, recognizing that we did the best we could\n*   Remind ourselves that we are human and that imperfections are okay\n*   View mistakes as learning experiences, rather than dwelling on them\n*   Take responsibility for our actions, focusing on what we can learn from them\n\nBy practicing self-compassion, we can cultivate a more positive and accepting relationship with ourselves, leading to greater happiness and well-being."}}

(2023) explored GPT-4's capabilities, determining if it surpasses mere memorization and possesses a profound and adaptable comprehension of concepts, skills, and domains. Their results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates a higher level of general intelligence compared to its predecessors.\n\nThe LAraBench study aims to fill an important objective of assessing the LLMs' capabilities for supporting Arabic language processing tasks, for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), at the same level of depth and breadth as for English tasks. Our evaluation involves 61 publicly available datasets and 98 test setups used to perform and evaluate language processing tasks in both MSA and dialectal Arabic across various genres (e.g., news articles, tweets, meetings, telephony, and broadcast content). Our evaluation focuses on assessing the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Jais-13bchat (Sengupta et al., 2023), and BLOOMZ (176B) for NLP tasks, and of Whisper (Large, 1.55B) and USM (2B) for speech processing, in both zero and few-shot settings. We investigate the following questions:\n\n1. Can LLMs effectively perform Arabic NLP and speech processing tasks without prior task-specific knowledge (zero-shot)?\n2. How does performance vary across tasks with different complexities in zero- and few-shot settings?\n3. How do LLMs compare to current SOTA models, and are open LLMs as effective as commercially available (closed) models?\n\nOur investigation reveals unique insights about LLMs' performance on Arabic NLP and speech tasks:\n\nA. Zero-shot Multi-task Performer: GPT-4 outperforms other models in the majority of the NLP tasks. However, a large performance gap remains between GPT-4 and SOTA models due to the higher quality of SOTA models. For speech tasks, USM outperforms all Whisper variants and performs comparably with SOTA.\n\nB. Few-shot and SOTA: GPT-4 reduces the performance gap with SOTA in the few-shot (only 3-shots) setting. This significant performance gain is noticed for almost all tasks, particularly for more complex semantic and question-answering tasks compared to syntactic and segmentation tasks. Similarly, Whisper models exhibit promising results in speech recognition with just 2 hours of speech examples in few-shot fine-tuning. Open models (BLOOMZ and Whisper) performed poorly compared to their commercially available counterparts. However, fine-tuning with more instructions may help these open models achieve closer performance to SOTA and other closed LLMs.\n\nC. MSA vs Dialect: The gaps in LLMs' performance between MSA and dialectal datasets (e.g., for machine translation (MT) and speech recognition task) are more pronounced, indicating the ineffectiveness of LLMs for under-represented dialects.\n\nD. Hallucination and Data Contamination: GPT models, especially GPT-3.5, suffer from the hallucination problem, where the model inserts extra information from its parametric memory. Benchmarking LLMs raises concerns about their exposure to existing datasets. In our study, we utilized datasets released after the cut-off date of GPT's training (September 2021). Moreover, we applied a prompt-based method with guided instructions (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023) on nine datasets using GPT-4 to determine if datasets are contaminated. Our experiments revealed that GPT-4 could not produce any examples from these datasets.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, LAraBench is the first comprehensive effort that includes commercial (closed) and open-source LLMs and evaluates zero- and few-shot settings for a wide range of Arabic NLP and speech tasks. It is the first to include the evaluation of Whisper and USM models for Arabic ASR and the first to report benchmarks for a standard Arabic TTS generative model. All resources and findings of the LAraBench study are made publicly available to scale up the effort through our LLMeBench framework (Dalvi et al., 2024).\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Minor grammatical corrections and sentence rephrasings for clarity.\n- Added transitional phrases to improve the flow of the text.\n- Renamed some sections for easier understanding.\n- Added commas to separate items in lists.\n- Removed the figure caption and integrated it into the text.\n- Minor adjustments to sentence structure and wording for better readability.\n- Added a brief summary at the beginning of the text to provide context.\n- Used a more formal tone and avoided colloquial expressions.\n- Removed the mention of \"The contribution was made while the Qatar Computing Research Institute.\" as it is not relevant to the main content.\n- Removed the mention of \"\u2020 Equal contribution.\" as it is not relevant to the main content.\n- Removed the mention of \"1We are referring to models with billions of parameters as LLMs.\" as it is already implied in the text.\n- Removed the mention of \"Figure 1: Average performance of the models as compared to SOTA across 21 unique NLP tasks and 31 testing setups.\" as it is already integrated into the text."}}

Conversely, keeping the eyes wide open and still may discourage tear formation by tensing the surrounding muscles. The only way to determine which approach works best for you is through personal experimentation. The anatomy of our tear ducts, which stretch from the sides of the nose to the eyelid, suggests that pinching the bridge of the nose and the sides, while clamping the eyes shut, can block tear flow. This technique is most effective when applied before tears begin to form.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that smiling has a positive impact on emotional well-being and can even influence how others perceive us. Moreover, the act of smiling can counteract the symptoms of crying, making it easier to prevent tears. One strategy to calm intense emotions is to take a moment to splash cold water on the face. This can have a dual effect: it relaxes the individual and boosts energy levels, making them more attentive. Alternatively, dripping cold water on the wrists and dabbing it behind the ears can also have a calming effect. This is because major arteries run through these areas just beneath the skin's surface, and cooling them can have a soothing impact on the entire body.\n\nGreen tea, in particular, contains L-Theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation, decreases tension, and increases awareness and focus. Drinking a cup of green tea may be an effective way to calm overwhelming emotions and prevent tears from forming. While black tea also contains L-Theanine, it has lower concentrations. Laughter is another inexpensive form of therapy that can improve overall health and reduce feelings of sadness or depression. Find something that makes you laugh and give yourself some much-needed relief.\n\nCrying often occurs as a result of prolonged tension, allowing the body to relax tense muscles and calm the mind. This process can also be seen as a cognitive activity, teaching individuals to recognize the physical sensations associated with being upset and tense versus being relaxed and calm. To practice this, start by tensing the muscle groups in your body, beginning with your toes and working your way up to your head in 30-second intervals. This technique can also help alleviate symptoms of insomnia and restless sleep.\n\nResearch suggests that feelings of helplessness and passivity are often at the root of crying episodes. To prevent crying, shift your body from a passive to an active state. This can be as simple as getting up and walking around the room or engaging your muscles by opening and closing your hands with a slight squeeze. If you find yourself causing physical harm, please discontinue this method and try one of the other techniques.\n\nPhysical pain can serve as a distraction from emotional pain, making it less likely to lead to crying.

While the amount earned may not be as much as the original purchase price, some parents find the extra money helpful. To maximize sales and potential profit, it's essential to ensure the clothing is in the best possible condition. This means:\n\n1. The clothes should be clean, with no stains.\n2. They should show minimal signs of wear and tear.\n3. They should be free of wrinkles, making them look nicer.\n\nWhen evaluating the condition of the clothing, parents should consider what potential buyers would be looking for. The best rule of thumb is to ask, \"Would I buy this?\" If not, it's probably not worth selling.\n\nTo present the clothing in an appealing manner, families should avoid tossing items into boxes or containers. Instead, they should strive to create a neat and organized display, similar to what's found in stores. Here are some tips to achieve this:\n\n1. Fold the clothes neatly and arrange them on tables or shelves.\n2. Consider hanging items on hangers to create a more store-like display.\n3. If folded, spread the clothes out a bit to make them easier to view.\n4. Prepare for the possibility that the display may get disrupted during the yard sale, and have a plan to tidy it up as needed.\n\nTo further enhance the shopping experience, families may consider providing bags for customers to carry their purchased items. This can make the process more convenient and enjoyable.\n\nWhile yard sales can be an effective way to sell outgrown baby clothes, their success depends on various factors. To attract potential customers, families should:\n\n1. Post signs in the neighborhood to direct people to the sale location.\n2. Consider placing an advertisement in a local newspaper or online platform.\n3. Include essential details such as the address, date, and time span for the sale.\n4. If the sale location is on a small side street, list the name of the closest main street to help people find it.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, families can determine the cost of the items they're selling, but often leave some room for bargaining. Prices can be displayed on signs or tags attached gently to the clothing.\n\nOne critical aspect to consider when planning a yard sale is the weather. Since the weather is unpredictable, families should advertise the sale in advance, allowing customers to plan accordingly. In areas with variable weather, it's a good idea to have a secondary date in mind and list it at the bottom of advertisements, in case the initial date is affected by bad weather."}}

To find Monarch caterpillars, you can either plant milkweed in your yard or search for overgrown land in your area where milkweed plants are already growing. The Asclepias syriaca variety of milkweed, also known as common milkweed, features a stalk with broad, oval-shaped leaves, while the Asclepias incarnata variety has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant pink or purple flowers. Milkweed plants are easily identifiable when in bloom, boasting a distinctive star-shaped flower arrangement and emitting a sweet, fragrant scent in the evening hours, which attracts pollinators like monarch butterflies. Milkweed thrives in areas with disturbed ground, such as roadsides, bike paths, railroad tracks, pastures, parks, and overgrown gardens, typically requiring full sun and well-drained soil to grow. Before searching for milkweed plants, familiarize yourself with the different varieties and their characteristics by conducting an online search and consulting a plant identification guide. Starting in late spring, when the flowers first begin to bloom, it's essential to regularly monitor the plant throughout the summer to ensure its health and the well-being of any Monarch eggs or caterpillars. Monarch eggs are a bright, rounded yellow, about the size of a pencil tip, and are usually found on the underside of a leaf, often with a subtle sheen to them. Female monarchs typically lay a single egg on each milkweed plant, carefully selecting a spot with the right amount of sunlight and moisture to optimize the egg's chances of survival. Monarch eggs hatch within 4 to 5 days, during which time they are sensitive to temperature and humidity fluctuations, requiring a stable environment with temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C) and humidity levels of 50-60%. Newly-hatched caterpillars are approximately the size of a grain of rice, featuring smooth bodies with faint black, yellow, and white stripes, while older caterpillars exhibit the same distinct stripes but are larger, growing up to 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) before transforming into a butterfly. To protect fragile Monarch eggs or newly-hatched larvae, it's best to leave them on the leaf, but if handling the milkweed is necessary, gently pluck off the leaf containing the egg, taking care not to touch or damage the eggs. Taking the entire milkweed stalk will provide an abundance of food for hungry caterpillars, but gathering a few leaves can also offer a nutritious snack. When inspecting the plant, be sure to check the entire stalk to ensure it's not hiding other insects or their eggs, such as aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites, which can harm the milkweed plant and the Monarch caterpillars. If you encounter an unexpected insect, carefully brush it away or remove the leaf containing the egg, taking care not to damage the milkweed plant. To keep the milkweed stalk fresh, wrap the end in damp paper towels, then in aluminum foil, and store it in a cool, dry place until ready for use. Alternatively, you can store the milkweed stalk in a foam floral tube, cutting the tube to the right size and placing the stalk inside. To maintain the milkweed's freshness, place a few drops of water on a paper towel, then position it in the bottom of a small container, such as a glass jar or a food storage container, and cover it with a lid featuring mesh or holes to allow air circulation. The water on the paper towel will help keep the milkweed leaf from drying out, allowing you to safely wait to move the larvae until they're about 4-5 days old, at which point they will begin to crawl. Once the caterpillars are 4-5 days old and approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, they'll be ready to transition to their main enclosure, where they can feed on milkweed leaves and grow into healthy, thriving caterpillars. If a caterpillar is crawling on a leaf, you can pick up the entire leaf and move it to a new enclosure, taking care not to touch or damage the caterpillar. If the caterpillar is on the bottom or side of the container, gently pick it up with your fingers to move it, taking care not to squish or harm the caterpillar. By hatching the eggs in a small container, you can closely monitor their progress and ensure the caterpillars remain healthy and thriving. When raising multiple generations of caterpillars, having a separate container for hatching eggs helps prevent the spread of illness, as you can only transfer healthy caterpillars to the larger enclosure. If you're concerned about damaging the larvae during transfer, lightly moisten the bristles of an artist's paintbrush, then slide each caterpillar onto the brush to safely transfer it, taking care not to touch or harm the caterpillar."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 17.27681541442871, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -3.1191232204437256, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "**Raising Monarch Caterpillars: A Step-by-Step Guide**\n\nThe majestic Monarch butterfly undergoes a remarkable transformation from egg to caterpillar to winged adult. To successfully raise Monarch caterpillars, it's essential to understand their life cycle and provide the right environment. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you find, raise, and care for these incredible creatures.\n\n**Locating Milkweed Plants**\n\nMonarch caterpillars exclusively feed on milkweed plants, which are the only host plants for their larvae. To find milkweed, either plant it in your yard or explore overgrown areas such as roadsides, bike paths, railroad tracks, pastures, parks, or overgrown gardens. Milkweed plants can grow up to 3 feet tall, with broad leaves and a distinctive star-shaped flower. If you're unsure about the plant's identity, consult a plant identification guide or search online for pictures.\n\n**Identifying Monarch Eggs and Caterpillars**\n\nMonarch eggs are yellow, round, and about the size of a pencil tip, usually found on the underside of milkweed leaves. Typically, there's only one egg per leaf, and a female monarch may lay only one egg on each plant. If you miss the eggs, you may spot newly hatched caterpillars, which are about the size of a grain of rice and have smooth bodies with faint black, yellow, and white stripes.\n\n**Caring for Monarch Eggs and Caterpillars**\n\nTo protect the fragile Monarch eggs or newly hatched larvae, gently snap the milkweed stalk or pluck off the leaf containing the egg. Carry the plant back to your home, and place it in a small container with moist paper towels and aluminum foil or foam floral tubes to keep the stalk fresh. For caterpillars already hatched, you can move them directly to their permanent enclosure.\n\n**Hatching Eggs and Transferring Caterpillars**\n\nTo hatch the eggs, place the milkweed leaf with the egg in a small container with a lid made of mesh or a hole-covered lid to allow air circulation. Add a few drops of water to the paper towel to keep the leaf from drying out. Wait for 4-5 days, and once the caterpillars emerge, they'll get their food and water by eating the milkweed leaves. You can safely wait to move the larvae until they're about 4-5 days old, when they'll be around 1 inch long.\n\n**Transferring Caterpillars**\n\nWhen the caterpillars are ready to move, gently pick them up with a moistened artist's paintbrush or your fingers if they're on a leaf. Move them to their main enclosure, and ensure they have enough milkweed leaves to eat. Keep a close eye on their progress, and if you're raising multiple generations, separate containers for hatching eggs will help prevent the spread of illness.\n\n**Tips and Precautions**\n\n* Before handling Monarch eggs or caterpillars, wash your hands to prevent the transfer of bacteria or other contaminants.\n* Avoid disturbing the eggs or caterpillars excessively, as this can cause stress and potentially harm them.\n* Keep the milkweed plant fresh by adding water to the paper towels and changing them regularly.\n* Monitor the caterpillars' health and behavior, and isolate any that appear ill or injured.\n* Release the adult butterflies into the wild, ideally in an area with an abundance of milkweed plants, to ensure their survival and continuation of the Monarch life cycle.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be well on your way to successfully raising Monarch caterpillars and witnessing their incredible transformation into majestic butterflies."}}

To improve flexibility and prepare your body for exercise, actively try to stretch at least once a day to make the most out of this essential activity. To get the most out of your stretches, remember to relax and breathe through the movement, just like you would when practicing deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body. To prevent injuries, keep your joints slightly bent and never locked during stretching, as this can help reduce the risk of muscle strain and joint damage. For instance, if you're stretching your legs, keep your knees slightly bent rather than locked in place, allowing your muscles to flex and move more freely. Avoid bouncing your muscles while stretching, as this can cause unnecessary strain and discomfort, and instead, focus on smooth and controlled movements. Instead, stretch smoothly and hold the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds to allow your muscles to fully relax and lengthen, which can help improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension. To maximize the benefits of stretching, repeat each exercise three times, allowing your muscles to fully engage and relax. Stretching can improve flexibility, reduce muscle tension, and allow you to perform various exercises more easily, but it does not improve muscle strength or heart efficiency. Whether you were a marathon runner before your heart attack or a couch potato, your exercise program after a heart attack starts with a walking program, which can help you transition back to more intense physical activity, just as you would gradually increase the intensity of a workout after a period of rest. To begin a walking program, do a three-minute walking warm-up to get your blood flowing and your muscles ready for the exercise ahead. Next, increase your pace to a level where you're breathing slightly heavier than when sitting, but can still carry on a conversation, which is often a good indicator of a comfortable and sustainable exercise pace. For instance, you might walk at a moderate pace where you're not struggling to breathe, but can still chat with a friend, allowing you to stay engaged and motivated throughout the exercise. Walk at this pace for about five minutes to allow your body to adjust to the new demands of exercise, and to get your heart rate up and your muscles warm. Gradually increase the duration of your walks by adding one to two minutes each day until you're walking 30 minutes a day, allowing your body to adapt to the demands of regular exercise. For the first few weeks, consider walking with a partner and staying close to home in case you become uncomfortable or experience shortness of breath, which can help you feel safer and more supported throughout the exercise. Carry a cell phone with you in case of an emergency, and remember to keep it close, so you can quickly call for help if needed, such as in the event of a heart issue or other medical concern. Following a heart attack, it's essential to avoid strenuous activity for four to six weeks to allow your heart time to heal, and to reduce the risk of further complications. It typically takes about six weeks for your heart to recover enough for moderate to heavy exercise, regardless of your pre-heart attack fitness level, which is often a good indicator of your overall cardiovascular health. During the recovery period, avoid activities that can put excessive strain on your heart, such as heavy lifting, vacuuming, running, or other high-impact exercises, which can help reduce the risk of further complications. As you progress, increase your exercise time and intensity gradually, but avoid anaerobic exercise, which can be too strenuous for your heart, and focus on low-impact activities that are easier on the cardiovascular system. You may experience muscle soreness in your legs and arms after starting a new exercise program, but this should subside as your body adapts to the demands of regular exercise, and you can reduce the risk of injury by listening to your body and taking regular breaks. However, it's essential to note that if muscle soreness is severe or painful during exercise, you should stop immediately and consult your doctor, as this can be a sign of a more serious underlying issue. As with any exercise program, it's essential to increase your time and intensity gradually to avoid injury and maintain motivation, and to focus on low-impact activities that are easier on the joints. Do not start increasing the duration or intensity of your walks until your physician has cleared you to do more than walk for 30 minutes, as they can provide guidance on how to safely progress your exercise routine. Once you're comfortable with brisk walking, you can begin incorporating other exercises, such as biking, hiking, or rowing, which can help improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of further complications. Your physician may recommend waiting before starting a strength training program, but you can discuss incorporating hand weights, resistance bands, or other low-impact exercises into your routine, allowing you to gradually increase the intensity and challenge your muscles. Resistance bands are versatile and can be used for both arms and legs, allowing you to gradually increase the resistance and challenge your muscles, which can help improve strength and mobility. When using resistance bands, be sure to give your muscles time to recover between sessions, limiting yourself to no more than three strength training sessions per week with at least 48 hours of rest in between, allowing your body to adapt to the demands of regular exercise. Strength training can help you regain your strength and mobility, allowing you to perform daily activities like mowing the lawn or playing with your grandchildren, which can improve overall quality of life. Regular strength training can also reduce the risk of muscle wasting and inactivity, which can help improve overall health and well-being. While lifting weights or using resistance bands, avoid holding your breath, as this can increase pressure in your chest and put additional strain on your heart, and focus on controlled and slow movements. Research has shown that prolonged sitting can undo the positive effects of exercise, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve overall health, and to minimize the risks of prolonged sitting, you can take regular breaks to move around and stretch. You can also encourage movement by placing your glass of water across the room or organizing your space to encourage regular getting up and down throughout the day, allowing you to stay active and engaged."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 16.54396629333496, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -6.549596786499023, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's the polished text:\n\n**Exercising Safely After a Heart Attack**\n\nBefore starting any exercise program after a heart attack, it's essential to consult with your doctor and obtain their permission.

The company will provide you with a week's notice before your car is ready to ship, giving you sufficient time to make arrangements. If the shipping dates are not flexible and your car must be picked up on a certain day, you can contact the company to schedule a pickup in advance. The shipping company will charge you extra for a specific scheduled pickup. This is a mandatory first step, even for open trailer shipping, so be sure to document any existing damage. You want to be able to note any chips, dings, nicks, or cosmetic damage accurately so that you can document the vehicle's condition before shipping. If you ship your car without washing it first, it will be difficult to determine if a nick or dent is new or existed before the car was shipped, and you may be held responsible for damage that was already present. You can wash your car by hand using only a bucket, water, soap, and clean rags for a thorough cleaning. The shippers will take precautions to keep your car safe, and thus you won't need the car alarm turned on, but the alarm should be disabled for safe transport. Before the shippers pick up your car, either fully shut off the car alarm or temporarily disable it so that you can easily turn it back on when you pick the car up. To disable the alarm, refer to your car manual and follow the manufacturer's instructions. You may need to navigate your car's electronic menu system to locate the alarm disable function. While the shippers will still be able to transport the vehicle if the car alarm is on, it will be an unpleasant and loud experience for them, so disable the alarm for their safety. Since you\u2019re not driving the car to its destination, there\u2019s no need to have the car shipped with a full tank of gas, as this will save weight and reduce fuel consumption. Shipping companies often prefer to ship cars with the gas tank close to empty because a full tank may overload the shipping truck, affecting its fuel efficiency and performance. A full gas tank is heavy and may overload the shipping truck, impacting its performance and fuel efficiency. If the gas tank is low, between 1/8th to 1/4th of a tank, it will save quite a bit of weight, making transportation more efficient. For example, secure or remove any loose parts or specialty items from your car such as ground effects, spoilers, or fog lights that could become damaged or broken during shipping. These items could become damaged or break off while the car ships, and the shipper's insurance may not cover this type of item, so remove them before shipping. If you have wide side mirrors, fold them back to prevent damage during transport. Be sure to lower and remove/retract the antennae to prevent them from being damaged during shipping. Also, remove any personal items from your car, as the shipping company will not be responsible for any lost or missing items. The shipping company will most likely not insure that personal items left behind will still be inside the car when it's delivered, so remove them before shipping. You may want to take and date photos of the vehicle prior to shipping it to document its condition. Then, compare these photographs with more photos you'll take after the vehicle arrives at its destination to identify any damage that occurred during shipping. These photos will show if the car was damaged while being shipped and will be valuable evidence to show the insurance company if you file for damages. Most shipping companies will provide you with a location to bring your car to on the day it ships, so be sure to arrive on time. The company will also specify a time at which you should bring your car by the pickup location. Bring your car to the location about 5 minutes ahead of schedule, so the driver can start the pick-up process promptly. Or, if your shipping company is picking up your car, have it in the street, ready to go by the pickup time, so the driver can collect it efficiently. When dropping off your car, be sure to hand your car keys over to the driver, so they can start the car and load it onto the truck. Otherwise, they'll be unable to start your car, and it won't move onto the truck, which could cause delays. You will need to provide three documents to verify your identity and prove that the car is registered in your name: a valid driver's license, a vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. If the registration and proof of insurance are not already in your glove box, make sure to put them somewhere in the car before you drop it off for shipment, so the driver can easily access them. The driver or a business representative from the shipping company may need to write down your ID number and your insurance policy number, so be prepared to provide this information. Before the shipping company can transport your vehicle, they'll need you to fill out and sign some paperwork, which includes a shipping invoice, a certificate of origin, and forms listing payments received and any outstanding financial balance. If you\u2019re shipping your vehicle internationally, you may need to sign forms dealing with import laws in the country the car is going to, so be sure to review and understand the requirements. The company may ask you to review and sign documents, including a shipping invoice, a certificate of origin, and forms listing payments received and any outstanding financial balance, so be prepared to sign these documents. The shipping company will appreciate your thorough descriptions of any difficulties that they may have when trying to start, stop, or drive your vehicle on and off of the trailer, so provide detailed information about any quirks or issues. Print this information on a sheet of paper that you\u2019ll leave in the vehicle when it\u2019s shipped, or send a shipping company representative an email describing your car's problems or quirks, so they can prepare for any challenges. For example, let the shipping company know if the engine floods easily, if a certain gear doesn\u2019t work, or if the parking break is too weak to hold the car in position when it\u2019s parked on an incline, so they can take necessary precautions."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 19.9094295501709, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.1939529180526733, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "For most car shipments, the transportation company will contact you to inform you of an open slot on a shipment vehicle.

If it says \"dry clean only,\" it's best to take it to a professional dry cleaner to prevent damage. If the label only mentions \"dry clean,\" it means that dry cleaning is the preferred method, but not the only one. If you're unsure, it's always safer to take your velvet article to a dry cleaner.\n\nHowever, if the label says \"dry clean\" and the fabric is a blend, such as crushed velvet or polyester velvet, it may be safe to hand-wash or machine-wash it. To be sure, check the fabric composition and follow the washing instructions carefully.\n\nIf you choose to dry clean your velvet at home, use a commercially available home dry cleaning kit and follow the instructions carefully. Make sure to read the product's instructions and call the hotline if you have any questions. Alternatively, you can take your velvet article to a professional dry cleaner, who has the training and expertise to handle delicate fabrics.\n\nIf you do decide to wash your velvet at home, always read the label first. If you have any doubts, err on the side of caution and dry clean it at home or through a professional. Avoid washing your velvet in hot water, as it can shrink the garment and cause it to lose its elasticity. Instead, use a gentle cycle or hand-wash it in lukewarm or cold water.\n\nTo hand-wash your velvet, fill a tub with lukewarm or cold water and add a small amount of delicate care laundry detergent. Gently swish the garment through the sudsy water, avoiding any scrubbing or twisting that can stretch or damage the fabric. Empty the tub and refill it with cold water to rinse the garment thoroughly. You can also spot clean individual stains by mixing a small amount of detergent with cold water and applying it to the stain with a clean, soft white cloth.\n\nWhen washing your velvet, be aware that using a dry cleaning solvent can be harsh on the fabric, so use it with caution. However, if you only need to freshen up your velvet garment, consider using a handheld steamer to remove wrinkles and give it a clean, lush appearance. Follow up with a spritz of fabric freshening spray to make it smell nice.\n\nRemember, never put your velvet clothing in a dryer, as it can shrink the garment and ruin the fabric's luxurious texture. Instead, hang any item you've machine-washed and allow it to dry thoroughly. If necessary, use a steamer to smooth out any wrinkles. For hand-washed garments, gently push out any excess water and lay the garment out on a flat surface to dry. Consider placing a clean, white towel under the item to prevent discoloration and allowing it to dry thoroughly.\n\nAdditionally, allowing your garment to sit on top of a dryer can help speed up the drying process while protecting your velvet garment from damage.\n\nI made the following changes to refine the text:\n\n1.

Decreasing your total daily calories by about 500 calories daily is a generally recommended approach, resulting in approximately 1 pound of weight loss per week.  However, cutting out too many calories may lead to slower weight loss and potential nutrition deficiencies, as you may not be consuming the recommended amount of essential nutrients. \n\nTo plan your daily calorie intake, consider using a food journal or journaling app to track your current calorie consumption.  Subtract 500 calories from your daily total to determine your target calorie intake for weight loss. \n\nFruits and vegetables are excellent choices for weight loss, as they are low in calories and rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  Incorporating half of your meals and snacks with fruits and vegetables can significantly help reduce overall calorie intake.  The recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables is about 5 to 9 servings per day.  A serving size is approximately 1/2 cup chopped fruit or 1 small piece, while a serving of vegetables is 1 cup cooked or 2 cups of salad.\n\nChoosing whole grains over refined grains can provide more fiber and essential nutrients.  When selecting grain-based foods, opt for 100% whole grains, such as 100% whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, whole grain oats, quinoa, or barley.  Refined carbohydrates, made with white flour or overly processed, offer limited nutritional benefits.\n\nFiber not only slows the digestive process but also keeps you feeling full for a longer period.  This allows your body time to absorb nutrients.  Lean protein is essential for any diet, especially for weight loss.  The required amount of protein depends on factors such as activity level and weight.  Lean protein helps you feel satisfied longer, making it a key component of a weight loss diet. \n\nInclude a 3-4 oz serving of protein-rich food at two meals or snacks.

These advancements have significant implications for the financial industry, where failing to analyze vast amounts of regulatory data and policies can result in costly regulatory violations and severe reputational damage. Indeed, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained traction in financial regulation as a solution for managing and interpreting complex regulatory information, which can have a direct impact on the bottom line of financial institutions. The ability to effectively process and analyze large amounts of regulatory text is crucial for compliance officers, risk managers, and other financial professionals, as it enables them to make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes. However, traditional methods of automatic text processing, including keyword searches and dictionaries, are both inefficient and costly, requiring system experts to design dictionaries on a case-by-case basis, which can lead to protracted and costly implementation timelines. Moreover, they are also prone to errors due to lack of coverage, which can expose users to costly regulatory violations and reputational damage. Modern NLP techniques have emerged in recent years, mostly based on deep neural networks and after the seminal breakthrough by Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser, and Polosukhin, who incorporated the attention mechanism to learn latent semantic links between words in a sentence more accurately, leading to significant improvements in language understanding and generation. These improvements, along with orders of magnitude increases in the availability of datasets and computational power, have led to the development of large language models (LLMs), a type of model known for its ability to achieve general-purpose language understanding and generation, such as OpenAI's GPT (used in ChatGPT), Meta's LLaMa, or Google's PaLM. One may however wonder whether LLMs are actually required for simple NLP tasks, such as semantic search, especially due to their costs, instead of free open resources, which can have a direct impact on the bottom line of organizations. In the present work, we perform a semantic search applied to laws and regulations using a domain adaptation technique with limited data, bearing in mind the limited available resources of small and medium enterprises, which can have a significant impact on their ability to compete in the market. We also recall the historical NLP approaches and explain the leading concepts in this field, which can have a direct impact on the development of new NLP techniques and models. In particular, we focus on semantic search, which naturally leads to the encoding concepts of a sentence, which can have a significant impact on the ability to understand and analyze complex language structures. We thus aim to fill the gap between well-known NLP concepts and the mathematical frameworks behind, which can have a direct impact on the development of new NLP techniques and models. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is a short historical review on encoding methods of a sentence into a mathematical object as well as key machine learning advances, which can have a direct impact on the development of new NLP techniques and models. In Section 3, we describe the task of semantic textual similarity, the different techniques at hand, and illustrate them with pseudo codes, which can have a direct impact on the ability to understand and analyze complex language structures. In Section 4, we apply these techniques concretely to financial regulation problems to improve semantic search matching, which can have a significant impact on the ability to comply with regulations and avoid costly violations.

These advancements, combined with the increasing availability of datasets and computational power, have led to the development of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT (used in ChatGPT), Meta's LLaMa, and Google's PaLM. These models are capable of achieving general-purpose language understanding and generation. However, their high costs and complexity have led some to question whether they are necessary for simple NLP tasks, such as semantic search.\n\nIn this work, we address this question by applying a domain adaptation technique with limited data to perform semantic search on laws and regulations, taking into account the limited resources available to small and medium enterprises. We also provide a historical review of NLP approaches and explain the leading concepts in this field. Specifically, we focus on semantic search, which naturally leads to the encoding concepts of a sentence. Our goal is to fill the gap between well-known NLP concepts and the mathematical frameworks behind them.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short historical review of encoding methods for a sentence into a mathematical object, as well as key machine learning advances. In Section 3, we describe the task of semantic textual similarity, the different techniques at hand, and illustrate them with pseudo codes. In Section 4, we apply these techniques concretely to financial regulation problems to improve semantic search matching. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions from this analysis.\n\nChanges made:\n\n1. Improved sentence structure and grammar.\n2. Added or corrected punctuation for clarity.\n3.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe landscape of robotics is undergoing a significant transformation, characterized by the emergence of advanced robots capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic and unpredictable settings [1]. One of the most pressing challenges in this field is the development of efficient and effective path planning strategies for robots, which requires a synergy between motion planning and perception algorithms. The literature has witnessed the proliferation of various methodologies in the realm of path planning, including graph optimization path planning [2, 3, 4], heuristic-based strategies [5], and the exploration of rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) [6, 7, 8]. Despite these advances, conventional path-planning frameworks often struggle to navigate complex environments and adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions [9, 10, 11].\n\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5-turbo, has introduced new capabilities, including natural language processing, question answering, and conversational dialogue. This raises the intriguing possibility of robots leveraging the vast knowledge encapsulated in such models to tackle complex tasks in the physical world. The question is: how can physical entities harness and apply the knowledge from LLMs to tasks in the tangible world?\n\nEmploying GPT-3.5-turbo for robotic path planning presents a promising avenue to overcome the limitations inherent in traditional methodologies. GPT-3.5-turbo's advanced natural language processing capabilities position it as an ideal candidate for tackling the multifaceted and dynamic challenges in robotics. Moreover, its ability to provide efficient and adaptable path-planning solutions in real-time lays a solid groundwork for future explorations in this domain.\n\nGPT-3.5-turbo has demonstrated outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks, including language production, question answering, and machine translation [12, 13, 14]. Its excellent accuracy and few-shot learning capabilities enable it to excel in these tasks, attributed to its capacity to identify patterns in vast amounts of data [15, 16, 17]. For instance, recent studies have demonstrated that GPT-3.5-turbo can automate the robot software's production and utilize GPT-3.5-turbo to produce code for robotic tasks in real-time [18, 19, 20]. Additionally, GPT-3.5-turbo has been shown to have the potential for human-robot interaction when utilized to generate natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks [21, 22, 23].\n\nOur approach is motivated by assessing the applicability of GPT-3.5-turbo to the robotics industry's path-planning challenge. The use of GPT-3.5-turbo in robotic path planning is a fascinating topic, as it has the potential to revolutionize the sector entirely. Our method converts the robotic path planning problem into a natural language problem to provide optimized paths for robotic systems. GPT-3.5-turbo then optimizes this problem to produce the desired results.

To better understand why your dog is barking, look for what may be causing the barking behavior when it happens. Common reasons for dogs to bark include: Fear/Alarm: When dogs are startled or afraid, they may bark, and their body language can reveal their emotional state, such as being hunched down, tucking their tails, and flattening their ears to their heads. Nervous dogs tend to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound, regardless of where they are, and their barks may be a way of expressing their anxiety. Territorial protection: Dogs protect what they perceive as \"their\" territory, which can be anywhere they associate with their owner, such as their house or yard, the car, or even their personal space around their body, and frequent routes they travel, considering everything along that route as \"their\" territory. Dogs also consider places or routes they travel frequently as their territory, so if you take your dog on the same walk every day, he's likely to consider everything along that route \"his.\" Attention: Many dogs will bark when they want attention, and these barks may be very short and focused, especially if the owner rewards the behavior by responding to the barking. Greeting: Dogs bark to say hello, and they may bark at other people or other animals, inviting some playtime. Anxiety: Dogs may bark due to separation anxiety, which can cause them to become distressed when left alone, leading to compulsive barking. Frustration: Dogs may bark when they're frustrated, such as when they're tied up, can't get at their favorite toy, or want to go and play with the dog next door. A dog may also bark if he's bored. Barking communicates your dog's emotional state, and reading their body language can provide clues as to how your dog feels. For example, if your dog is afraid, she may bark while hunched down, and their barks may be a way of expressing their anxiety. Once you know what's behind the barking, you can help quiet your dog. Here are some signs of your dog's various moods: Afraid: When dogs are afraid, they make themselves smaller to appear as less of a threat, and their body language can reveal their emotional state, such as being hunched down, tucking their tails, and flattening their ears to their heads. Happy: When dogs are happy, their muscles are relaxed, and their mouths are loose, which may look like they're smiling, and their ears and tail are in the natural positions. Alert: Dogs go on the alert if they perceive something could be a threat, and their ears are perked up, their gaze will focus on whatever they're looking at, and their tails may be upright or over the back. Playful: Dogs who are feeling playful are all over the place, and they're very energetic, with bouncy movements, and they may jump, run in circles, or bow to invite you to play. Dominant: Dogs who feel confident about the interaction display assertive body language, standing very tall, arching their necks, and appearing slightly tense, and their tails are usually upright and still. Aggressive: Dogs who feel confident and aggressive about the situation make themselves look bigger by raising their tails, pricking up their ears, and holding their heads high, and they may lunge or look ready to pounce. Aggressive dogs who are feeling defensive combine fearful and confident body language. You can tell a lot about a bark by how it sounds, and studies have shown that humans are fairly good at deciphering the overall emotion behind the tone of dog barks. Happy barks are usually high-pitched, and barking as a greeting may also include other noises, such as whines and growls. Barks demanding attention are often short, focused barks, and lower-pitched or harsh-sounding barks usually indicate a disturbance of some kind, like fear or alarm. Separation anxiety barking sounds are often shrill and sound despairing and miserable, and compulsive barking is often a monotone barking that sounds repetitive and is often accompanied by movement that seems compulsive."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 165.51451110839844, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.638221740722656, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here is an improved version of the text:\n\nDogs exhibit a diverse range of barks, and understanding the underlying causes of these barks is essential to addressing the behavior.

This will help you predict potential challenges, like securing funding or finding the best location for your business, which requires meticulous consideration of factors like high foot traffic areas, zoning restrictions, and accessibility to attract a loyal customer base, and mitigating risks through thorough market analysis and competitor research. Traditionally, business plans are divided into sections such as executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management, service or product line, marketing, funding, financial projections, and appendix, which provide a comprehensive framework for planning a successful business venture by outlining key strategies, operational procedures, and financial objectives. Be as detailed as possible in your plan, including specific financial projections, marketing strategies, operational procedures, and clear goals and objectives, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of your business's vision, mission, and operational requirements, and to guide decision-making processes effectively. Make a clear list of the smaller details about your business, such as owner and employees' responsibilities, services offered, product pricing, and operational protocols, to ensure a smooth, efficient, and customer-centric operation, and to maintain high standards of quality and customer satisfaction. To maximize your chances of success, you'll need to determine what unique features or services your aquarium shop can offer that customers in your area can't get from your competitors, such as a wider selection of exotic fish or a more extensive aquarium design service, and to differentiate your business through innovative products, exceptional customer service, and competitive pricing. Visit other aquarium shops to see their products and services, pricing, operational aspects, and customer experiences, allowing you to identify areas for improvement, differentiate your business from the competition, and develop a unique selling proposition that resonates with your target audience. Another effective way to conduct research is to learn from leading aquarium shops, then figure out how you can do it better, such as by offering more competitive pricing, providing additional services like aquarium maintenance or repair, and implementing cutting-edge technology to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency. For example, if a major aquarium shop offers free next-day installation, consider offering free same-day installation to attract more customers and increase customer loyalty, and to establish a positive reputation for exceptional customer service, timely delivery, and high-quality products. Check with your state and local governments to learn what types of licenses and certificates your business will need, such as a permit to sell certain types of fish or a license to operate a pet store, and to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. Because you'll be working with animals, your shop will be subject to animal welfare laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act, which requires businesses to provide a safe and healthy environment for animals, protect their welfare, and ensure their humane treatment and care. For example, if your aquarium shop is located in the United States, it is required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act, which ensures that businesses prioritize animal welfare, provide a safe environment for animals, and adhere to strict guidelines and regulations. If you're unsure about the necessary licenses, certificates, or insurance, consider hiring a business attorney with experience working with pet stores to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and to minimize potential risks and liabilities. Ideally, try to hire a business attorney with experience working with pet stores, who can provide valuable insights, help you navigate the complex legal requirements for opening and operating a pet store, and ensure that your business operates within the bounds of the law. It may seem counterintuitive, but you'll want to look for an available storefront as close to your biggest competitor as possible, to take advantage of the foot traffic generated by their store, which can help attract customers to your business, increase visibility, and drive sales. Plus, if they're successful, it's likely due in part to their location, which means placing your store in the same location can help your shop benefit from the existing customer base and foot traffic, increase brand recognition, and drive business growth. However, you may not want to be directly next to your competitor, since customers may consistently choose your competitor's store over yours, which is why it's essential to differentiate your store through unique features, services, or pricing, and to establish a distinct brand identity. However, you should aim to be in the same shopping center or area of town, if possible, to benefit from the existing customer base and foot traffic, while also taking steps to differentiate your store from the competition through innovative products, exceptional customer service, and competitive pricing. If you're planning to only sell materials online, you don't need to worry as much about where your store or warehouse is located, as long as you have a reliable shipping and logistics system in place, which can ensure timely delivery, high-quality packaging, and exceptional customer experiences. You can acquire most of these items from a local small business wholesaler, who can provide you with a wide range of products and services tailored to your business needs, including competitive pricing, flexible payment terms, and exceptional customer support. Unless you plan to do all the work running the store by yourself or within your family, you'll probably need to bring on some extra staff to help with the day-to-day operations of your business, who can provide valuable insights, help with customer service, and maintain high standards of quality and customer satisfaction. Hire these workers before you actually open your store for business, so you can hit the ground running, ensure a smooth transition from planning to execution, and establish a strong foundation for future growth and success. For best results, try to hire workers who have previous experience working in aquarium shops, as they will be familiar with the industry, provide valuable insights and expertise, and help your business thrive by offering exceptional customer service, maintaining high-quality products, and adhering to industry standards and best practices."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 22.4755859375, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -3.504199266433716, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Refined Business Plan for an Aquarium Shop:\n\n**Executive Summary:**\nOur aquarium shop aims to provide a unique and personalized experience for customers in the local community.

In all cases, a language model is used in combination with other information sources to rank alternative hypotheses by assigning them probabilities based on their likelihood, which is a fundamental aspect of many natural language processing applications, such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, where the accuracy of the results depends on the ability of the language model to assign the correct probabilities to different hypotheses, and this is achieved through complex algorithms that analyze vast amounts of data. This ranking process is critical in applications like information extraction, where the accuracy of the results depends on the ability of the language model to assign the correct probabilities to different hypotheses, thereby enabling the extraction of relevant information from large datasets and providing valuable insights to users, such as identifying specific entities or relationships within a text. There are classical techniques for constructing language models, such as n-gram models with various smoothing techniques, pioneered by Chen and Goodman in 1998, which laid the foundation for the development of more sophisticated language models, and these techniques are still widely used today. However, as the complexity of the tasks has increased, new and more general problems have arisen that are related to the construction of language models, requiring more sophisticated approaches to address these challenges and improve the performance of language models in various applications, including large-vocabulary speech recognition, text classification, and sentiment analysis, and this has led to the development of new algorithms and techniques that can handle the increased complexity. We present new and efficient algorithms to address these more general problems, which can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of language models in various applications, including large-vocabulary speech recognition, information extraction, and machine translation, and these algorithms have been designed to work seamlessly with existing language models, ensuring a smooth transition to more advanced technology. Counting classical language models are constructed by deriving statistics from large input text, which is a crucial step in the development of language models, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns and relationships from vast amounts of data, and this process is essential for building accurate and robust language models. In speech mining applications or for adaptation purposes, one often needs to construct a language model based on the output of a speech recognition system, which may not always provide accurate results due to the complexity of the input, and this can be challenging, especially when working with large vocabularies and complex linguistic patterns. However, the output of a recognition system is not just text; it is often a complex representation of the input, such as a word lattice, which contains multiple possible transcriptions with their corresponding probabilities, making it a challenging task to construct a language model based on this output, and this is where the importance of word lattices comes in. Indeed, the word error rate of conversational speech recognition systems is still too high in many tasks to rely only on the one-best output of the recognizer, making it necessary to consider alternative transcriptions that are contained within the word lattice output by the recognition system, and this is where the concept of word lattices becomes crucial. Thus, the word lattice output by speech recognition systems is used instead because it contains the correct transcription in most cases, providing a more accurate representation of the input that can be used to construct a language model, and this is achieved through complex algorithms that analyze the lattice and identify the most likely transcription. A word lattice is a weighted finite automaton (WFA) output by the recognizer for a particular utterance, representing the possible transcriptions and their probabilities, which is a complex data structure that contains a very large set of alternative transcription sentences for that utterance with their corresponding weights or probabilities, and this is where the importance of word lattices comes in. A necessary step for constructing a language model based on a word lattice is to derive the statistics for any given sequence from the lattices, or WFAs, output by the recognizer, which is a computationally intensive task that requires efficient algorithms to ensure the performance of language models is not compromised, and this is where the concept of WFAs becomes crucial. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the expected count of any given sequence in a WFA and report experimental results demonstrating its efficiency, which can significantly improve the performance of language models, especially in tasks with large vocabularies, such as speech recognition and text classification, and this algorithm has been designed to work seamlessly with existing language models, ensuring a smooth transition to more advanced technology. Representation of language models by WFAs classical n-gram language models admit a natural representation by WFAs, where each state encodes a left context of width less than n, which can be used to construct language models that are more accurate and robust, and provide a more efficient way of representing complex linguistic patterns, and this is achieved through the use of WFAs, which are a type of finite automaton. However, the size of that representation makes it impractical for offline optimizations such as those used in large-vocabulary speech recognition or general information extraction systems, requiring approximation techniques to limit the size of the representation, which can compromise the accuracy of the language model, and highlight the need for more efficient and accurate representations of language models, and this is where the concept of approximation techniques becomes crucial. Most offline representations of these models are based instead on an approximation to limit their size, which can compromise the accuracy of the language model, highlighting the need for more efficient and accurate representations of language models, and underscoring the importance of developing new techniques for language modeling, and this is where the importance of approximation techniques comes in. Class-based models in many applications, it is natural and convenient to construct class-based language models, that is, models based on classes of words, as pioneered by Brown et al. in 1992, which have proven to be effective in improving the accuracy and robustness of language models, and provide a more general and flexible representation of language, and this is achieved through the use of classes, which are a way of grouping words based on their meaning or function. Such models are also often more robust since they may include words that belong to a class but that were not found in the corpus, providing a more general and flexible representation of language, and enabling the language model to capture subtle nuances and variations in language use, and this is where the importance of class-based models comes in. Classical class-based models are based on simple classes such as a list of words, which can be limited in their expressiveness, but new clustering algorithms allow one to create more general and more complex classes that may be regular languages, providing a more powerful representation of language, and this is achieved through the use of clustering algorithms, which are a way of grouping words based on their meaning or function. We present a simple and more general approach to class-based language models based on general weighted context-dependent rules, as described by Kaplan and Kay in 1994 and Mohri and Sproat in 1996, which can significantly improve the performance of language models, and provide a more flexible and powerful representation of language, allowing for the creation of complex classes and capturing subtle nuances in language use, and this is achieved through the use of weighted context-dependent rules, which are a way of defining the relationships between words and their context. Our approach allows us to deal efficiently with more complex classes such as weighted regular languages, providing a more flexible and powerful representation of language, and this is achieved through the use of weighted regular languages, which are a way of defining the relationships between words and their context. We have fully implemented the algorithms just mentioned and incorporated them in a general software library for language modeling, the GRM Library, which includes many other text and grammar processing functionalities, as described by Allauzen et al. in 2003, and this library provides a comprehensive toolkit for language modeling, and can be used to improve the performance of language models and provide a more accurate and robust representation of language. In the following, we will present in detail these algorithms and briefly describe the corresponding GRM utilities, which can be used to improve the performance of language models and provide a more accurate and robust representation of language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various natural language processing tasks, and this will provide a comprehensive overview of our approach and its applications."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 35.659263610839844, "some": 0.9232790470123292, "bart": -4.34280868938991, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's the polished text:\n\nStatistical Language Models: Crucial Components of Modern NLP Systems\n\nStatistical language models are fundamental components of many contemporary natural language processing systems, such as speech recognition, information extraction, machine translation, and document classification.

The analysis of semantic correctness and the quality of textual descriptions is beyond the scope of this paper. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) a generation strategy for avoiding syntax errors in generated markup, and 2) a combination of consistency checks and reachability analysis techniques over LLM-generated domains and problems. In particular, we integrate several mechanisms into a LLM-based generation loop. Misused predicates and parameter types are filtered out before planning, and missing, contradictory, or unreachable predicates are detected and forwarded back to the LLM to correct mistakes. As a result, the amount of errors in the generated domains is reduced, leading to significantly improved domain descriptions for the final human checks. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we describe the role of domain description languages in robotics and define the problem statement.

We celebrated at a charming restaurant in Downtown LA's Arts District, a place my dad had always wanted to visit and was finally able to experience with us, surrounded by the city's vibrant atmosphere and rich history, and its nostalgic allure that resonated deeply with him. As we finished our meal, it struck him that he had grown up just a short walk from the restaurant, prompting a series of nostalgic reflections about his youth and the memories that came flooding back. With some extra time on our hands, dad chose to take us on a tour of the house where he spent many formative years, sharing stories about his childhood adventures and the laughter and struggles that shaped him. As a natural storyteller, my dad takes immense pride in his hometown, and it was a gift to see him relive memories of his youth, recalling friends, mischief, and the freedom of his childhood, which he cherishes to this day. Our kids were captivated by his tales of shining shoes for local gangsters and dodging bullies by running across rooftops, their imaginations sparked by his vivid descriptions and the sense of wonder that came with them. They laughed at his comedic embellishments and were in awe of his fierce independence and feisty spirit, especially considering that he had been given free rein as a five-year-old to explore his surroundings and forge his own path. He shared intimate details about his strained relationship with his emotionally cold father, finding solace in his mom's warmth, a constant source of comfort and understanding in his childhood, which helped shape him into the person he is today. He also mentioned the day his mom passed away, a poignant memory he rarely shares, especially with his children, but it reminded him of the importance of cherishing family time and the memories we make together, and the love that remains. Cross-generational sharing is essential to my wife and me, as it provides our kids with a deeper understanding of their heritage and a sense of history that shapes their lives and informs their values, giving them a strong foundation for the future. This helps them gain valuable perspectives on their own lives, a sense of belonging, and a deeper understanding of themselves, allowing them to navigate the world with confidence and empathy, and a heart full of love. Our kids have a strong moral compass and a \"can-do\" attitude when it comes to tackling challenges and fixing their own problems, thanks to the values we've instilled in them, which guide them every step of the way.

The inaccuracies of LLMs compromise their reliability and pose significant challenges for their application in critical domains. The root causes of hallucinations remain a subject of ongoing investigation. Several factors contribute to hallucinations, including models' overreliance on their own outputs and the intrinsic uncertainties associated with their training data. The implications of hallucinations are profound, potentially facilitating the dissemination of misinformation, diminishing trust in AI technologies, and causing detrimental effects in sensitive decision-making contexts. To address the challenge of hallucinations, particularly in Question Answering, the academic community has dedicated considerable effort to devising strategies to minimize hallucinations.

This field aims to improve the interaction between humans and computers. As a multidisciplinary field, NLP combines linguistics, computer science, and mathematics to achieve effective communication between humans and computers by leveraging the strengths of each discipline through synergistic integration. The intricacy of NLP involves complex processes such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, which are essential for understanding and generating human language. NLP typically employs algorithms such as statistic-based and deep learning algorithms, including: - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) - Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) Some of the most prominent language models are the GPT and BERT families, which excel in various NLP tasks, including language translation and text summarization, by leveraging their advanced language understanding capabilities and setting a high standard for language models. While increasing parameters and model tuning can enhance performance, models still struggle with generating fictional information, highlighting the issue of producing novel and accurate language content through creative generation. Researchers have employed the technique of retrieval, which significantly enhances language model performance by providing a broader understanding of the context through access to external knowledge and information. Zhao et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive overview of work on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multimodality, while Zhao et al. (2024a) focus on retrieval augmentation generation techniques for the artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) domain, highlighting the practical applications of RAG in real-world scenarios. The article lacks sufficient detail to provide a comprehensive timeline of the overall development, leaving many aspects of the topic underexplored and requiring further investigation to uncover the full scope of NLP advancements. Li et al. (2022b) focus on text generation only, and the article has fewer figures and tables, making the content more abstract and lacking concrete evidence to support its claims.

The complexity of NLP is evident in the numerous steps it encompasses, including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, stemming, named entity recognition, and more, all of which contribute to the challenge of replicating human language understanding in artificial intelligence systems.\n\nTraditional natural language processing tasks typically employ statistic-based algorithms (Hogenboom et al., 2010; Serra et al., 2013; Aussenac-Gilles and S\u00f6rgel, 2005) and deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Yin et al., 2017), recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Banerjee et al., 2019), long short-term memory networks (LSTM) (Yao and Guan, 2018), and others. The advent of the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as a leading representative of natural language processing has significantly grown its popularity. This architecture, as a prominent large language model (LLM) in the natural language processing domain, has consistently demonstrated enhanced performance, attracting the attention of an increasing number of researchers who are engaged in studying its capabilities.\n\nThe most prevalent LLMs nowadays are the GPT families (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023) and Bert families (Liu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Sanh et al., 2019), which have been demonstrated to excel in a multitude of natural language processing tasks. Among these, the AutoEncoder language model is particularly adept at natural language understanding tasks, while the AutoRegressive language model is more suited to natural language generation tasks. However, increasing parameters (Touvron et al., 2023b) and model tuning (Han et al., 2023) can enhance the performance of LLMs, the phenomenon of \"hallucination\" (Ji et al., 2023) persists. Furthermore, the limitations of LMs in effectively handling knowledge-intensive work (Feng et al., 2023) and their inability to promptly update their knowledge (Mousavi et al., 2024) are consistently apparent.\n\nTo address these limitations, numerous researchers (Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard and Grave, 2020b; Khandelwal et al., 2019) have employed the technique of retrieval to obtain external knowledge, which can assist the language model in attaining enhanced performance in a multitude of tasks. In this context, retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have garnered significant attention. RALMs are capable of retrieving relevant information from a large corpus and utilizing it to enhance the performance of LLMs.\n\nHowever, there is a scarcity of comprehensive surveys that thoroughly review the application of augmented retrieval techniques across the spectrum of NLP. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of recent RALM work. The article focuses not only on the work related to RAG but also places significant emphasis on RALM and aligns with the concept of NLP. The two components of RALM, the Retriever and the Language Model, are described in detail, and the different interaction modes of these two components are precisely defined for the first time.\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive overview of the RALM work schedule, along with a summary of the common and novel applications of current RALM, accompanied by an analysis of the associated limitations. Potential solutions to these limitations are proposed, along with recommendations for future research directions.\n\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.

However, even top-performing language models struggle with non-English languages, which poses a significant challenge. This method efficiently adapts pre-trained English models to other languages, leveraging their strength and utilizing computational resources (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). When vocabulary is vastly different or underrepresented, it can lead to inefficient tokenization or failure to represent a new language. A crucial question arises when initializing the embeddings of new vocabulary items: How do we do it effectively? Several methods have been proposed, ranging from simple random initialization (Antoun et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020) to more sophisticated approaches (Minixhofer et al., 2022; Dobler and de Melo, 2023; Tran, 2020; Liu et al., 2024). Comparisons with simple initialization methods across different model sizes are lacking in existing works. Importantly, we prove that initializing embeddings within the convex hull of original embeddings ensures the existing language is not impacted by new vocabulary items on initialization, which sets the foundation for our subsequent analysis. We compared our approach (CW2V) with five existing initialization strategies, including OFA, on two models with varying parameters and five downstream tasks across four languages. Notably, we found that simpler methods like multivariate initialization are comparable with more advanced approaches. We make our implementation publicly available for further research and development."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 39.70442199707031, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.905311107635498, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's an improved version of the text with suggestions for clarity, grammar, and style:\n\nLanguage models have made significant advancements in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Liu et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024; Goyal et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). However, despite their impressive performance in English, these models often struggle to achieve similar results in other languages. To bridge this gap, researchers have employed a common approach of continually pre-training and fine-tuning the English model for other languages (Conneau and Lample, 2019). This approach leverages the capabilities acquired through large-scale English pre-training and focuses on aligning the English and other language spaces, making efficient use of computational resources and data (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, one of the major challenges in adapting language models to new languages is the lack of vocabulary coverage in the original model's tokenizer. This can result in either incomplete representation of the new language or inefficient tokenization due to inadequate vocabulary representation. To address this issue, researchers have proposed expanding the tokenizer to incorporate new vocabulary and then performing continual pre-training on monolingual data from the new language (Cui et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023; Minixhofer et al., 2022).\n\nA crucial aspect of this process is initializing the embeddings of the new vocabulary items. Various methods have been proposed in the literature, ranging from simple random initialization (Antoun et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020) to more sophisticated approaches such as OFA, which learns the new embeddings as a function of existing embeddings using external resources and tools like cross-lingual word-vectors and bilingual dictionaries (Minixhofer et al., 2022; Dobler and de Melo, 2023; Tran, 2020; Liu et al., 2024). However, there is currently no theoretical basis for what constitutes a good initialization method.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to address this knowledge gap by theoretically defining and analyzing the properties of a good initialization. We demonstrate that initializing embeddings of new vocabulary items to be within the convex hull of original embeddings ensures that the greedy generation of existing languages is not impacted by the new vocabulary items on initialization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple learnable initialization approach, Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which ensures initializations within the convex hull without relying on cross-lingual embeddings.\n\nIn our experiments, we compare CW2V with five existing initialization strategies, including OFA, on two models with varying parameters (RoBERTa, 125M, and LLaMa2, 7B), and examine their impact across five downstream tasks in four languages. Our analysis reveals that CW2V achieves comparable or better performance than previous best methods. Moreover, we find that simpler methods, such as multivariate or mean initialization, which ensure new embeddings remain within the convex hull, are comparable with more advanced approaches like OFA. We release our code publicly for the benefit of the research community.\n\nChanges made:\n\n1. Improved sentence structure and clarity.\n2. Added transitional phrases to enhance flow.\n3.

Prior to this date, all three of my dogs were fine and healthy, running and playing like normal dogs, enjoying the warm sunshine and carefree days of spring, and bringing joy to our home with their energetic antics and loving nature. However, in May, my Black Lab started to develop a slight limp, which we initially thought was just a minor injury from rough play, but as the days passed, it only grew worse, causing us concern and worry, and prompting us to seek medical attention for our beloved pet. A week went by, and the limp was noticeably worse, causing my mom and me to become increasingly concerned, wondering what could be causing our normally energetic dog to slow down, and fearing the worst for her health and well-being. We soon scheduled a vet appointment for the following week, hoping that the veterinarian would be able to identify the problem and provide a solution, and prayed for a quick resolution to our dog's condition, which was causing us so much distress and anxiety. The day finally came to take my dog to the vet, who gave her a quick examination and said she was fine but had hurt her back jumping, which explained the limp and gave us a sense of relief, but it was short-lived, and we soon realized that her condition was more serious than we had initially thought. At that point, I was not too concerned, thinking the vet knew exactly what he was talking about and had everything under control, but as the days went by, our dog's condition continued to worsen, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Another week passed, and the limp continued to worsen, prompting us to take her back to the vet for further examination, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong, and that our dog's condition was more serious than we had initially thought. This time, the vet had done an X-ray, which revealed a slight disc slip in her back that had been there for a while but shouldn't have been causing the limp, a discovery that left us stunned and confused, and raised more questions than answers about our dog's health and well-being. Days later, the results of the X-ray came back, and the vet said she had a slight disc slip in her back, which had been there for a while but wasn't the cause of her limp, a diagnosis that left us feeling frustrated and uncertain, and wondering what the future held for our beloved pet. A few days went by, and nothing seemed to be helping, so we decided to take her to a specialist vet who would conduct more extensive tests, including blood tests and scans, in a desperate bid to find the root of the problem and save our beloved dog, and we held onto hope that she would recover and be back to her old self in no time. After hours of waiting for the results, we finally received the devastating news that our dog had cancer, a diagnosis that crushed us and shattered our world, and left us feeling lost and helpless, and unsure of what to do next. We were completely shattered, our lives turned upside down in an instant, and the news hit us like a ton of bricks, leaving us stunned and heartbroken, and wondering how we would ever navigate this difficult time. For a moment, we were even more hopeful when the vet told us that surgery could be done for $10,000, but only if the cancer hadn't spread to her lymph nodes, a glimmer of hope that we clung to desperately, and prayed that it was true, and that our dog would be okay. However, upon further testing, the vets found that the cancer had spread throughout her body and lymph nodes, a discovery that left us feeling defeated and heartbroken, and wondering how we would ever say goodbye to our beloved pet. That night and the next day, we said our goodbyes, knowing she was no longer able to walk due to her condition, and the pain of losing her was almost too much to bear, a sadness that still lingers to this day, and a reminder of the importance of cherishing every moment with our loved ones. This was the worst day of my life, and I still cry every day thinking about her, the memories of her sweet face and loving spirit etched in my mind forever, and a constant reminder of the love and joy she brought to our lives. My life forever changed that day, and my attention is constantly with my other two dogs who lost their best friend, a void that can never be filled, and a reminder of the importance of being present and cherishing every moment with our loved ones.

Rusting begins as small, discrete red and orange spots that rapidly coalesce and expand to cover the surface, often forming intricate networks of patterns as the metal undergoes intense oxidation and degradation, accompanied by a series of complex chemical reactions and structural transformations that ultimately lead to the breakdown of the metal's surface. The meteorite's surface may display a black coloration, with subtle variations in hue, such as a steely, bluish-black appearance, which can result from the unique conditions imposed by atmospheric entry, including the effects of high-velocity collisions with atmospheric particles and the associated shockwave-induced melting, leading to the formation of a vitreous glassy layer on the rock's surface. Some meteorites may develop conical or pointed shapes as a result of the partial melting and re-solidification of metal as they pass through the atmosphere, a process known as thermal ablation, which involves the rapid cooling and solidification of molten metal, resulting in the formation of a characteristic shape that is indicative of extraterrestrial origin. Although rounded or normal-shape rocks can still be meteorites, this morphology is unusual for extraterrestrial objects, and other distinctive features such as fusion crusts, regmaglypts, and spherules should be examined in conjunction with the rock's density and magnetic properties to confirm its origin. As the rock passes through the atmosphere, its surface melts, and the high air pressure pushes the molten material back, creating a fusion crust through a process known as thermal ablation, which involves the rapid cooling and solidification of molten metal, resulting in the formation of a vitreous glassy layer on the rock's surface that is characterized by a distinctive rind-like appearance. The fusion crust resembles a thin, vitreous coating on the rock's surface, often described as a black, glassy layer, which has formed as a result of intense heat and rapid solidification, resulting in a characteristic rind-like appearance that is indicative of the rock's extraterrestrial origin. If a rock displays a crust-like surface with small, radiating streak lines, it is likely a meteorite, as these features are indicative of the intense heat and pressure associated with atmospheric entry and the subsequent thermal ablation process, which involves the rapid cooling and solidification of molten metal. Look for specific features such as fusion crusts, regmaglypts, and spherules, which are distinctive indicators of a meteorite's extraterrestrial origin and can be used in conjunction with the rock's density and magnetic properties to confirm its identity and distinguish it from terrestrial rocks. Meteorites are dense, solid rocks with a high metal content, as measured by their specific gravity and magnetic properties, which typically range between 3.5 and 7.9 g/cm3, and if the rock is porous or bubbly, it is not a meteorite, as these characteristics are indicative of terrestrial origin and a lack of the intense heat and pressure associated with atmospheric entry."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 27.28706932067871, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -6.626596450805664, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here is the polished text:\n\nIf the rock you've found is a freshly fallen meteorite, it will typically be black and shiny due to having burned through the atmosphere. However, after an extended period on Earth, the iron metal within the meteorite will oxidize and turn to rust, resulting in a rusty brown color. This rusting process begins as small red and orange spots on the surface, gradually expanding to cover more of the rock. You may still be able to observe the original black crust, even if some areas have started to rust.\n\nMeteorites are not typically round; instead, they are often irregular in shape, with varying sides of differing sizes and shapes. While some meteorites can develop a conical shape, most will not appear aerodynamic upon landing. Although irregularly shaped, most meteorites will have rounded edges rather than sharp ones.\n\nIf the rock you've found is relatively normal in shape or is round like a ball, it may still be a meteorite. However, the vast majority of meteorites are irregular in shape. As rocks enter the Earth's atmosphere, their surfaces begin to melt, and air pressure forces the molten material back, creating a featureless, melt-like surface known as a fusion crust. If your rock's surface resembles melted and shifted material, it may be a meteorite.\n\nA fusion crust is typically smooth and featureless, although it may also exhibit ripple marks and \"droplets\" where molten stone had moved and resolidified. If your rock lacks a fusion crust, it is most likely not a meteorite. The fusion crust may resemble a black eggshell coating the rock.\n\nIn desert environments, rocks may develop a shiny black exterior that resembles fusion crust. If you found your rock in a desert setting, consider whether its black surface might be desert varnish. Flow lines are small streaks on the fusion crust resulting from the molten material being forced backwards. If your rock has a crust-like surface with small streak lines across it, there's a good chance it's a meteorite.\n\nFlow lines may be small or not immediately apparent to the naked eye, as the lines can be broken or not completely straight. Use a magnifying glass and a discerning eye when inspecting the surface of a rock for flow lines.\n\nAlthough the surface of a meteorite is generally featureless, it may also exhibit shallow pits and deep cavities that resemble thumbprints. Look for these on your rock to determine both if it's a meteorite and what type of meteorite it is. Iron meteorites are particularly susceptible to irregular melting and will have deeper, more defined cavities, whereas stony meteorites may have craters that are smooth like the rock's surface.\n\nThese indentations are technically known as \"regmaglypts,\" although most people who work with meteorites will refer to them as \"thumbprints.\" While craters and cavities on the surface may indicate that your rock is a meteorite, no meteorite has holes in its interior. Meteorites are dense pieces of solid rock; if the rock you've found is porous or bubbly in appearance, it's unfortunately not a meteorite.\n\nIf the rock you've found has holes in the surface or appears \"bubbly\" as if it was once molten, it is definitely not a meteorite. Slag from industrial processes is often confused for meteorites, although slag has a porous surface. Other commonly mistaken types of rock include lava rocks and black limestone rocks.\n\nIf you're having trouble discerning between holes and regmaglypts, it may be helpful to view side-by-side comparisons of these features online to learn how to spot the difference."}}

Instead of being overly lenient, set clear boundaries and consequences while still offering support and guidance. If a student is considering dropping out because they're not taking responsibility, remind them that they're expected to take on responsibilities. Some students consider dropping out simply to enjoy their freedom, but this is not a valid reason to abandon their education and sacrifice their future. Dropping out of school requires taking responsibility for one's decisions, actions, and their consequences. Having a trusted adult to talk to can give a student hope and a new perspective on their future, making a significant difference in their life.

Pick a neutral color for the main part of your outfit, which is a color that doesn't draw attention away from other elements in the outfit, such as pairing a black suit with a pale pink shirt or a gray dress with a bright blue jacket, and then add one or two other colors around it by selecting shades that complement the neutral, like pairing a beige coat with a soft coral scarf and a navy blue dress. For instance, try pairing a black suit with a pale pink shirt because the cool tone of the pink complements the neutral tone of the black, creating a harmonious and balanced look, as the contrast between the cool and neutral tones creates visual interest and depth due to the way the pink's cool tone tempers the black's neutral tone, and this combination works well together because the pink and black are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. When pairing neutrals like navy and olive with other colors, consider their hues and the way they interact on the color wheel, as colors that are adjacent to each other, such as olive and maroon, tend to create a harmonious and natural look due to their similarity in tone and saturation, resulting in a visually appealing combination, and this is because the olive and maroon are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. For instance, olive complements maroons and oranges because these colors are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, creating a harmonious and natural look, as the warm tones of the olive and maroon create a sense of cohesion and balance due to the way their similar tones work together, and this combination works well together because the olive and maroon are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. Pick out two complementary colors on the color wheel, which are colors that are opposite each other, such as blue and orange, and use that to build your outfit, as these colors create a visually appealing combination due to the high contrast between them, making for a bold and eye-catching look, because the blue and orange are complementary colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a high level of contrast and visual interest. For instance, pairing orange and blue creates a visually appealing combination, such as a bright orange shirt with a dark pair of blue jeans, due to the way the cool tone of the blue complements the warm tone of the orange, resulting in a harmonious and balanced look, and this combination works well together because the blue and orange are complementary colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a high level of contrast and visual interest. Another effective way to use complementary colors is to pair one complementary color with a paler tint of its opposite color, such as pairing a purple dress with a pale yellow shawl, as this creates a harmonious and balanced look due to the contrast between the cool tone of the purple and the warm tone of the yellow, adding visual interest to the outfit, and this combination works well together because the purple and yellow are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. For instance, pairing a purple dress with a pale yellow shawl creates a harmonious and balanced look, as the cool tone of the purple is complemented by the warm tone of the yellow, creating a sense of visual interest and depth, resulting in a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look, and this combination works well together because the purple and yellow are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. Try picking two to three colors that are right next to each other on the color wheel and guide your outfit with those, because these colors will create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look due to their similarity in tone and saturation, resulting in a natural and harmonious combination, such as pairing yellow, orange, and red, and this combination works well together because the yellow, orange, and red are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. For instance, pairing yellow, orange, and red creates a harmonious and natural combination, as the warm tones of these colors create a sense of cohesion and balance, making for a visually appealing outfit, and this combination works well together because the yellow, orange, and red are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. While you usually should avoid mixing warm and cool colors, you can occasionally break that rule if you find a combination that looks good together, as the contrast between the warm and cool tones can create a visually appealing effect by adding visual interest and depth to the outfit, making for a unique and striking look, and this is because the contrast between warm and cool colors can create a high level of visual interest and depth, making for a memorable and stylish outfit. For example, pairing a bright yellow dress with a pale green cardigan creates a harmonious and balanced look, as the cool tone of the green complements the warm tone of the yellow, creating a sense of cohesion and balance, resulting in a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look, and this combination works well together because the yellow and green are adjacent colors on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. A good place to start with a monochrome look is with the primary colors, which are red, yellow, and blue, because these colors create a bold and eye-catching combination due to their high saturation and brightness, and can add visual interest to an outfit, making for a cohesive and stylish look, as seen in a navy pantsuit paired with a pale blue shirt and bright blue pumps, making for a cohesive and stylish outfit. For instance, pairing a navy pantsuit with a pale blue shirt and bright blue pumps creates a harmonious and balanced look, as the cool tone of the blue creates a sense of cohesion and balance, making for a visually appealing outfit, and this combination works well together because the navy, pale blue, and bright blue are adjacent colors on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. When creating a monochrome look, try to stay within the same spoke on the color wheel, which means choosing colors that are adjacent to each other, such as true blues or true reds, as these colors create a harmonious and balanced look due to their similarity in tone and saturation, resulting in a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing combination, such as true blues like navy or royal blue, and this combination works well together because the navy and royal blue are adjacent colors on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. That is, if you choose blue, be sure to select true blues, such as navy or royal blue, rather than purple-y blues, which are a combination of blue and red, to create a harmonious and balanced look, as the cool tone of the true blue creates a sense of cohesion and balance, making for a visually appealing outfit, and this is because the navy and royal blue are analogous colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. Try wearing a bright red shirt with grey leggings or a royal blue skirt with a flowing white top, as the primary colors create a bold and eye-catching combination due to their high saturation and brightness, and can add visual interest to an outfit, making for a striking and memorable look, because the red and blue are primary colors that create a high level of visual interest and depth, making for a stylish and memorable outfit. However, this can be challenging, and it's often hard to predict which colors will work well together, as seen in a combination of bright yellow and pale green, which may be an unusual but effective pairing, providing a unique and visually appealing look, and this combination works well together because the yellow and green are adjacent colors on the color wheel, creating a smooth and natural transition between them. You may come up with a combination that you never thought of before, and trying new combinations can help you discover new and interesting ways to style your clothes, as experimenting with different color pairings can lead to unexpected and effective results, making for a stylish and memorable outfit, and this is because experimenting with different color pairings can help you find unique and effective combinations that you may not have thought of before."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 23.76105499267578, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -6.412248134613037, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's the refined text:\n\nNeutral colors such as black, white, brown, gray, and olive or navy can serve as the foundation for your outfit.

This growth is a testament to the rapid technological advancements that have led to an increased reliance on digital platforms for business operations, thereby transforming the way organizations conduct their daily activities. To achieve this transformation, organizations have had to adapt to new digital tools and technologies. A key aspect of this digital proliferation is the widespread use of technologies for collecting personal data, primarily driven by the goal of enhancing targeted marketing strategies and better understanding customer behavior. The ability to collect, analyze, and utilize user data has become a fundamental component of modern commerce, providing businesses with valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences, which inform their strategic decision-making processes. However, the escalating collection and utilization of personal data have raised significant concerns about users' right to privacy, sparking a heated debate around data protection and online security, and the potential risks associated with data breaches. Users' data has become a valuable commodity in the digital marketplace, putting them at risk of having their privacy compromised, which can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and society as a whole, including the erosion of trust in digital platforms. This concern has driven the emergence of regulatory bodies and the establishment of data protection legislation aimed at safeguarding users' privacy and creating a framework for protecting online citizens and their digital rights. Legislations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States have imposed strict requirements on how organizations handle personal data, setting a high standard for data protection and data handling practices. Complying with these legislations poses a significant challenge to businesses, requiring substantial investments in data management and compliance infrastructure, which can be a substantial burden on organizations' resources and divert attention away from core business activities. Regulators face a daunting task in manually assessing each online service's adherence to privacy laws, given the rapid growth of online services and globalization, making it essential for them to adopt innovative solutions that leverage technology to enhance their regulatory capabilities. The dynamic nature of online services, where data processing practices and privacy policies are subject to frequent changes, further complicates this task, necessitating a more agile approach to data regulation that can adapt to the evolving digital landscape. In response, automated methods have been proposed for analyzing privacy policies at scale, enabling regulators to conduct large-scale evaluations and promote higher compliance with privacy regulations, thereby supporting the effective enforcement of data protection laws and promoting a safer online environment. This approach has the potential to inform research on privacy concerns and provide a practical tool for regulators to conduct mass evaluations of applications and services, promoting higher compliance with privacy regulations and supporting the effective enforcement of data protection laws."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 28.526954650878906, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.759551048278809, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's the rewritten text with improvements in fluency, coherence, and grammar:\n\nThe digital era has led to unprecedented expansion in web and mobile applications, as well as online services.

In response to these challenges, researchers have proposed automated-driven methods for analyzing privacy policies at scale. This approach holds the potential for research endeavors aimed at understanding and highlighting privacy concerns, as well as offering a practical tool for regulators to conduct mass evaluations of applications and services, thereby promoting a higher level of compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nAutomated analysis of privacy policies has leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which have been developed using symbolic and statistical approaches. While symbolic approaches rely on pre-defined rules, leading to lower performance compared to statistical approaches, state-of-the-art research has predominantly relied on statistical approaches, such as machine learning (ML) techniques, and particularly supervised learning models, to train and evaluate models identifying privacy practice disclosures, such as personal data collection or sharing.\n\nThese models require the use of manually annotated datasets, which are often expensive, time-consuming to create, and prone to errors. Furthermore, building and training those models require advanced technical expertise, contributing to a higher barrier to entry. As a result, their practical application is mainly suitable for large-scale projects where the benefits can outweigh these significant costs.\n\nIn contrast, modern Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a significant advancement in the NLP domain, enabling the understanding and generation of human-like text, making it particularly well-suited for parsing and analyzing the complex language present in privacy policies without needing annotated datasets. In this context, this paper proposes the application of LLMs for the effective and efficient extraction of privacy practices from privacy policies.\n\nWe focus on ChatGPT, which relies on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, and identify the optimal configuration of ChatGPT prompts, parameters, and models, integrating advanced techniques such as few-shot learning. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our proposed ChatGPT configuration with Llama 2 and other state-of-the-art techniques. Our findings reveal that our proposal competes with and even outperforms these traditional methods, offering advantages regarding lower upfront costs, reduced processing times, and greater ease of use.\n\nTherefore, we propose LLM-based solutions and our specific ChatGPT configuration as a viable replacement for traditional NLP techniques in the task of automated privacy policy processing. Our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the application of GenAI in legal and regulatory contexts, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more efficient, cost-effective, and accessible tools for privacy policy analysis."}}

To really target those hips, sit farther back on the bike seat and focus on pushing down hard on those pedals.  You may even want to increase the resistance to challenge yourself further.  If you're in a standing position on your bike, stick your butt out far behind you, requiring you to stabilize your body with your butt and hip muscles.\n\nRemember to include at least one day of rest per week in your exercise plan to prevent plateaus and give your body time to recover.  By mixing up your workouts and their intensity, you'll stay motivated and see consistent results."}}

When I arrived late at night, I found her asleep and sat in a nearby chair, exhausted, until morning, when I would finally have the chance to hold her and offer what little comfort I could. In the morning, I called out, 'Hey, Grandma!' but her eyes, though open, seemed distant and unfocused, as if she was struggling to find her way back to a place she once knew so well. Over the next few days, she struggled to regain her footing, her body weak and her mind disoriented as she fought to reclaim her former self.

To show you are actively listening, use a combination of maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding, which can help to create a sense of connection and understanding. You can also indicate your interest by paraphrasing what the other person has said, for example, \"I hear you saying that you feel I don't help out enough around the house.\" You need to have an open and honest conversation about your wife's behavior and how it affects you too. During this conversation, let's find common ground by discussing the issues that are frustrating you both and work towards a resolution; by doing so, you might find that you are both frustrated by the same things, such as a lack of teamwork in household chores, as you could say, \"I agree that we're not really working together on household chores.\" The nagging might be a serious problem for you, but don't forget that there are lots of things you love about your wife too, so reconnect with each other by being affectionate and, in doing so, reconnect with your wife, and remember that being heard means that your wife is taking in what you are saying, understanding it, and acting on it, which is clearly not happening if your wife continues this behavior.

It is essential that you get some kind of resolution to these negative emotions, and if your wife does not change her behavior, you need to keep revisiting the issue, making it clear that you are not going to let the matter drop with your wife; considering this, you have every right to demand some sort of resolution, especially if you've attempted to communicate and even sought counseling, at which point it may be necessary to make a firm demand, considering whether the nagging is a deal-breaker for your relationship.

Try to find common ground, as you may both be frustrated by the same issues. For instance, you could say, \"I agree that we're not working together effectively on household chores. How can we create a fair division of labor? I'm feeling overwhelmed lately.\" By approaching the conversation in a non-confrontational manner, you can work together to find solutions.\n\nHowever, if nagging is a persistent problem, it's essential to address it directly. Reiterate your feelings and concerns, and make it clear that you've made an effort to change. Try saying, \"I've explained to you that I feel hurt, angry, and frustrated when you nag me, even though I've tried to make adjustments. I need you to understand my perspective and take my feelings into consideration.\"\n\nIf your wife's behavior persists, it may be time to consider seeking outside help.

Ask your wife if she's willing to attend counseling with you, and if she's not, consider going on your own to process your emotions.\n\nIt's essential to find a resolution to this issue, as living with negative emotions can be detrimental to your relationship and overall well-being.

You can say, \"I know we discussed this last week, but I haven't seen any positive changes. I need you to understand the hurt you're causing me.\"\n\nIf all efforts to communicate and find a resolution fail, it may be time to make a firm demand. Consider whether the nagging is a deal-breaker for you, and if it's not, you can continue to try to make your wife hear you. However, if you can no longer tolerate the stress, it's essential to communicate your feelings and boundaries clearly. Try saying, \"I can't continue to live with this stress. If you can't make some immediate changes, I'll need to take a step back from our relationship.\"\n\nIn conclusion, effective communication is key to resolving conflicts and strengthening your relationship.

Breaking up your study routine into manageable chunks will help you stay on top of your coursework and retain information more effectively. It's essential to have a schedule in place to ensure you have enough time to study for the test. The difficulty level of the material directly impacts the amount of time you need to study for the test, so it's essential to factor this into your study plan. Studying the material every day, rather than cramming at the last minute, helps you absorb the information gradually, reduce the likelihood of burnout, and retain it more effectively. This approach also allows you to revisit concepts you don't quite understand. If you don't understand something, studying beforehand gives you enough time to ask the teacher about it in class, which can save you from confusion and poor grades. Looking at previous tests you have taken in the class can be a valuable resource in understanding the types of questions and topics the teacher is likely to cover on the test. What kinds of things does the teacher look for in answers, such as broad concepts or specific examples, can give you a better understanding of how to study effectively. Analyzing the types of questions your teacher asks can help you identify areas where you need to focus your studying and make it more effective. By understanding the teacher's approach, you can tailor your studying to meet their expectations. Some teachers and professors provide sample tests for students, which can be a valuable resource for getting an idea of how the test will be structured and what to expect. Looking at previous homework assignments can also be helpful, as many teachers will use homework questions on the test or write questions in a similar way. Changing how you study by mixing up your routine can be more effective than studying the same way every night. This approach helps keep your brain engaged and prevents burnout. While studying, going through your textbook and class notes can help you identify the most important concepts that are relevant to the test. This approach also helps you stay focused and avoid wasting time on unnecessary topics. Listening closely to your teacher when they lecture can give you hints about what material will show up on the test, such as key concepts or vocabulary. Take note of any hints the teacher provides during lectures, as this can help you stay on track and avoid last-minute cramming. If you're struggling with the material, attending a tutoring session can provide you with personalized guidance and support. A tutoring session can help you better understand the material and address any gaps in your knowledge. You may also ask a classmate who understands the material for help, which can be a great way to learn from someone who has already mastered the concepts. However, it's essential to approach the classmate in a way that works for both of you, such as asking them to explain the concept in a way that makes sense. Having a review sheet with all the major terms, concepts, and ideas that will be on the test can be a huge help in your studying, as it makes it easily reviewable and helps you remember the material better. This can give you a sense of confidence and security, knowing that you're prepared for the test. Having a study guide can give you a comprehensive overview of the material and help you stay focused, especially if the teacher provides one. By completing the study guide, you can identify areas where you need more practice or review. Many times, teachers will pull questions directly from the study guide or reword questions from the study guide, so it's essential to pay close attention to the study guide to prepare for the test. Study guides can also help you focus your studying, ensuring you study the correct material and avoid wasting time on unnecessary topics. This can save you time and stress in the long run. Gathering a few classmates from your class to study together can be a great way to learn from one another and stay motivated. By studying with classmates, you can quiz each other, come up with possible test questions, and use each other's notes to fill in gaps in your own notes.

If the material is straightforward, you may not need as much time to study as you would for more complex topics. \n\nStudying consistently is one of the most effective ways to pass a test. Cramming at the last minute is not advisable, as it can lead to poor performance. Instead, dedicate 30-60 minutes each day to reviewing the material covered in class. This daily routine will help solidify your understanding of the subject matter and make it easier to recall key concepts.\n\nIf you prefer not to study every day, consider dedicating the week or two before the exam to intensive studying. This will give you sufficient time to revisit concepts that need clarification and absorb the information. If you're unsure about a particular topic, studying beforehand allows you to ask your teacher for clarification in class.\n\nTo optimize your studying, examine previous tests you've taken in the class. Note the types of questions that were marked wrong and the kinds of answers your teacher was looking for. This insight will help you study more effectively and improve your performance.

The text classification task is related to several domains, including intention classification, topic classification, sentiment analysis, etc. (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong, 2019; Risch and Krestel, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Heo et al., 2021). Since the advent of pre-trained language models, such as Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Transformer-based deep learning models have exhibited excellent performance for text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2020). However, Transformer-based deep learning models may underfit due to the model being too large compared to the available training data (Liu et al., 2019). In data-driven machine learning, collecting sufficient high-quality data is essential for adequate model learning; however, this can be challenging so many studies address this issue through data augmentation using existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019; Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020). For instance, data can be augmented by translating an English sentence into French and back to English using a French-English translation model. In the text modification approach, data is augmented using various techniques, including replacing a word with a synonym, inserting a random word, or changing word positions, among other methods (Wei and Zou, 2019). To evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme, we fine-tune and assess BERT, a representative pre-trained Transformer-based language model, as a baseline. Our objective is to make data augmentation methodologies easily accessible to the research community."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 32.96622085571289, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.633304595947266, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's an improved version of the text:\n\nText classification is a prominent downstream task in natural language processing (NLP), with active research studies conducted across various domains. The text classification task is relevant to several domains, including intention classification, topic classification, sentiment analysis, etc. (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong, 2019; Risch and Krestel, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Heo et al., 2021). The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), has led to the development of high-performance text classification models based on Transformer-based deep learning architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2020). However, these models may suffer from underfitting due to the extensive size of the model compared to the size of the training data (Liu et al., 2019). To mitigate this issue, some studies have reported that artificially increasing the size of the data can improve performance in various tasks (Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In data-driven machine learning, collecting sufficient high-quality data is essential for adequate model learning. However, this process is not always viable, and many studies tackle this issue by utilizing data augmentation techniques with pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019; Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).\n\nNatural language data augmentation typically involves two primary strategies: collecting data using human resources and creating or modifying data mechanically or semi-automatically. The former guarantees data quality, but collecting and preprocessing large-scale data manually is extremely time-consuming and costly. Therefore, various automation strategies have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Representative approaches for data augmentation include using a generation model or modifying a part of the text (Yu et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020). For example, Yu et al. (2018) proposed a back-translation method using both directions of machine translation systems, where the data is augmented by translating an English sentence into French and then translating it back to English through a French-English translation model. However, this approach may suffer from semantic discrepancy due to round-trip translation to other languages.\n\nIn contrast, text modification approaches augment data similar to the original text using strategies such as replacing a specific word with a synonym, inserting a random word, changing the position of two random words in a sentence, or deleting a random word (Wei and Zou, 2019). Other studies have investigated the effect of giving synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and hypernym, and using semantic text exchange (Feng et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, these approaches often require considerable time and budget, as they rely on thesauruses such as WordNet or part-of-speech taggers.\n\nTo address the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation model and character order change (COC) strategy. Our methodology consists of three steps, as depicted in Figure 1. The first step is to augment data using a generation model on raw text, which we define as data augmentation with generation (DAG). The second step is to augment data using COC, a strategy that corrupts some words appearing in raw text, and we define this as data augmentation with modification (DAM). Finally, we combine the two methods and call it data augmentation with generation and modification (DAGAM). Our methodology is a simple and easy strategy to automatically augment natural language data.\n\nWe evaluate our proposed data augmentation scheme on six benchmark datasets in the text classification task. To verify the utility of our scheme, we use BERT, a representative Transformer-based pre-trained language model, for fine-tuning and evaluation. The performance improvement achieved on all benchmark datasets, compared to the case without augmentation, confirms the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.\n\nThe main contributions of our work to the field are:\n\n* We propose DAG, a data augmentation method using a generation model, DAM, a data augmentation method using character order changing (COC), and DAGAM, a combined scheme of the two methods, verifying and comparing their utility through BERT-based fine-tuning and evaluation.\n* Our work provides a simple and easy-to-implement data augmentation strategy that can be easily accessed by the community of industry and academia.\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n1.

This inference stems from the understanding of the spatial relation between the two Eiffel Towers and the geographical locations of Paris in France and Arkansas in the United States.\n\nThe process of geospatially grounded language understanding involves core tasks such as recognizing geospatial concepts being described, inferring the identities of those concepts, and reasoning about their spatially qualified relations. These tasks are essential for applications that involve the use of place names and their spatial relations, such as social media message analysis, emergency response, natural disaster analysis, and geographic information retrieval.\n\nPretrained language models (PLMs) have seen broad adaptation across various domains, including biology, healthcare, law, software engineering, and social media. These models benefit from in-domain corpora to learn domain-specific terms and concepts. Similarly, a geospatially grounded language model requires training with geo-corpora that cover worldwide geo-entity names and their variations, geographical locations, and spatial relations to other geo-entities.\n\nAlthough some geo-corpora are available, such as LGL and SpatialML, the sizes of the datasets are relatively small. In contrast, Wikipedia stores many articles describing places worldwide and can serve as a comprehensive geo-corpora for geospatially grounded language understanding. However, training with Wikipedia only solves partial challenges in geospatial grounding, as it only provides the linguistic context of a geo-entity with sentences describing history, demographics, climate, etc. The information about the geospatial neighbors of a geo-entity is still missing.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose GEOLM, a language model specifically designed to support geospatially grounded natural language understanding. Our model aims to enhance the comprehension of places, types, and spatial relations in natural language. We use Wikipedia, Wikidata, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) together to create geospatially grounded training samples using geo-entity names as anchors. GEOLM verbalizes the Wikidata relations into natural language and aligns the linguistic context in Wikipedia and Wikidata with the geospatial context in OSM.\n\nTo incorporate geospatial information into the model, we employ a spatial coordinate embedding module to learn the distance and directional relations between geo-entities. This module allows GEOLM to take either natural language or geographical subregion (i.e., a set of nearby geo-entities) as input and make inferences relying on the aligned linguistic-geospatial information.\n\nWe employ two training strategies: contrastive learning between natural language corpus and linearized geographic data, and masked language modeling with a concatenation of these two modalities. We treat GEOLM as a versatile model capable of addressing various geographically related language understanding tasks, such as toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geospatial relation extraction.\n\nThe proposed model, GEOLM, can be trained using the following components:\n\n1.  Wikipedia and Wikidata form the natural language corpora.\n2.  OpenStreetMap (OSM) forms the pseudo-sentence corpora.\n3.  GEOLM takes the natural language and pseudo-sentence corpora as input and pretrains with masked language modeling and contrastive loss using geo-entities as anchors.\n\nGEOLM's architecture and training strategies enable it to learn the complex relationships between geo-entities and their spatial relations, making it a powerful tool for geospatially grounded natural language understanding."}}

This process removes lumps and helps incorporate the three ingredients.\n\nFor a homemade self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625g) of all-purpose flour, 7\u00bd teaspoons (30g) of baking powder, and 1\u00bc teaspoons (7.5g) of salt.\n\nAdd the shortening (or lard for a richer and flakier biscuit) to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Using your fingers, rub the shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles large crumbs. Next, create a well in the center of the dough and pour in the cold buttermilk and water. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop mixing as soon as the dough starts to come together, as overmixing can lead to dense and chewy biscuits.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a floured countertop or flat surface and sprinkle some flour on top. Flatten the dough into a circle with your hands and fold the left side into the center, followed by the right side on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball. Repeat these folding steps a second time to fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing.\n\nAvoid kneading the dough, as this can develop the gluten and result in dense biscuits. Instead, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Ensure the dough is evenly thick to prevent biscuits of different sizes. Use a floured 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch out as many biscuits as possible. When you can't get any more biscuits, collect the dough scraps, shape them into a ball, and roll out the leftover dough.\n\nContinue cutting out biscuits until there's no longer enough dough for more. Transfer the biscuits to a baking sheet, positioning them side by side so they're all just touching. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter that's been warming on the oven. This will add a salty kick to the biscuits and help them become a nice golden brown when baked.\n\nTransfer the biscuits to the preheated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown color. Remove the biscuits from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire cooling rack and let them cool completely, about 30 minutes.\n\nServe the biscuits plain, buttered, with jam or cream, or with cheese, meat, gravy, or any other topping you like."}}

You should cultivate self-respect, which is about genuine confidence and being secure in who you are. When interacting with a girl, focus on being genuine rather than basing your happiness on her interest in you, and avoid coming across as desperate or insincere. Be respectful to others in her presence, as their feelings and well-being are just as important as hers. Avoid using degrading language, such as telling a rape joke or referring to your ex-girlfriend as 'that,' which can be hurtful and damaging. You'll come across as disrespectful if you're not treating her with kindness and respect. Make it seem like you're genuinely interested in what she has to say by following up with another question about what she just said. Girls value it when people are genuinely interested in their thoughts and opinions, so ask her about her job and listen to her response with attention and care. Obviously, listen to what she says and don't just be formulating your next question, allowing her to feel heard and understood. Don't get too personal too quickly with a girl you've just met, as this can be overwhelming and make her uncomfortable. You don't have to have a big smile when you're hanging out with her, but it's a good idea to make your interactions fun, as a fun atmosphere can be more attractive than a full-on grin. She'll remember that being around you was fun and charged, which is often more attractive to girls than a big, forced smile. Make her laugh with funny, real stories, especially ones in which you come off as human and relatable. It shows you can laugh at yourself by telling her about the time you tried to scare your dad, only to scare someone else. Be careful with humor, because not everyone has the same sense of humor, so gauge her reaction to your jokes before continuing. Avoid making jokes that are racist or sexist, as these can be hurtful and damaging. Flirting can create a fun atmosphere, but it's a delicate balance that requires attention and care. Make sure you gauge each girl's reaction, because every girl is unique in what she likes and dislikes, and what works for one may not work for another. Tease her gently by poking fun at her in a kind way, avoiding hurtful or mocking behavior.

Effective note-taking is doubly important, as it enables you to efficiently identify and record key elements of the narrative, ultimately facilitating a deeper understanding of the text. To optimize your notes, consider highlighting or underlining important passages and providing brief explanations for why they are significant (\"symbolism,\" \"character shift,\" \"repeated metaphor,\" etc.). On paper, note major plot developments, shifts in character arcs, overarching themes, and passages or moments that require further analysis.\n\nDuring class discussions, take notes on important pages and quotes that you may have missed, ensuring that you stay engaged and informed. While it is possible to go overboard with notes, aim for a balance that provides a comprehensive yet concise framework for your writing. A well-organized note-taking system will serve as a valuable guideline for your writing when you finish the book.\n\nTo get the most out of a novel, it is essential to develop a strong understanding of literary vocabulary. Familiarizing yourself with terms like metaphor, motif, allusion, and symbolism will enable you to identify and analyze these elements in the text, ultimately enriching your comprehension of the narrative. Furthermore, having a solid grasp of literary vocabulary will help you to articulate your thoughts and opinions more effectively when writing or discussing the book.\n\nKey literary terms to keep in mind include:\n\n- **Theme**: The overarching ideas, morals, or thoughts of the novel. This can range from simple concepts like \"good beats evil\" to more complex ideas like \"capitalism is destroying the modern family.\"\n\n- **Metaphor**: A comparison between two dissimilar things without using \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, \"She is a rose\" implies that the woman is beautiful, delicate, and a little barbed.\n\n- **Simile**: A comparison between two dissimilar things using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"She is like a rose / She is pretty as a rose.\"\n\n- **Motif**: A repeated idea, image, or flavor in a book. If a novel frequently employs sailing and ocean metaphors, it may be said to have a \"nautical motif.\"\n\n- **Allusion**: A reference to another work, either directly or indirectly. For example, a character who dies and is raised from the dead (A Tale of Two Cities, Harry Potter) may be considered a \"biblical allusion\" to Jesus Christ.\n\n- **Symbolism**: When an object in the book represents an idea or concept beyond its literal meaning. Symbolism is ubiquitous, sometimes unintentional, as humans often think in terms of symbols. For instance, in Of Mice and Men, the rabbit farm comes to symbolize Lenny's dreams of financial security and safety.\n\nBeyond identifying key literary elements, consider the following questions when reading a novel:\n\n- How exactly is the story told? Is there humor, or is it mostly serious? Are the sentences long and difficult or short and speedy?\n- Do you think the author was influenced by other writers, artists, or current events? If so, how do they use fiction to explore those influences?\n- How does the author use literary devices to reinforce their message?\n- Are there any potential biases or perspectives that the author may be conveying?\n\nSome teachers recommend reading summaries before starting the book to enhance focus on characters, themes, and structure. This approach can also help you stay engaged and attentive throughout the narrative.\n\nNovels operate on two levels: \"function\" and \"form.\" The former concerns what the novel is trying to say (plot, theme, setting, etc.), while the latter refers to how it is being said (perspective, structure, metaphor, etc.). Excellent readers will note how these two elements intersect, examining how the form reinforces the function. For example:\n\n- David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest explores the nature of entertainment, debating whether one must work for entertainment. The novel's unconventional structure, featuring extensive footnotes, forces the reader to work by flipping back and forth, even within sentences and other footnotes.\n- Bram Stoker's Dracula employs a series of letters and first-hand documents to tell its horror story, creating a sense of realism and slowly ratcheting up the tension.\n\nTo expand your knowledge of a book, consider researching the historical background, the author's life and inspiration, or reading critical essays, which are common for \"classic\" books. When writing longer papers, reading the thoughts of other writers can help you form your arguments early on. Always cite outside sources and use them as a jumping-off point for your own opinions.\n\nUltimately, effective note-taking, a strong understanding of literary vocabulary, and a willingness to engage with the novel on multiple levels will enable you to gain a deeper understanding of the text and articulate your thoughts and opinions more effectively."}}

Existing multilingual systems focus primarily on downstream NLP tasks that rely heavily on upstream linguistic features such as token and sentence boundaries, part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency trees. These features are crucial for effective NLP processing, which requires a solid foundation to ensure accurate results. Several popular NLP toolkits have been developed to support multilingualism, including spaCy, UDify (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), Flair (Akbik et al., 2019), CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), UDPipe (Straka, 2018), and Stanza (Qi et al., 2020).

Various studies have focused on creating downstream NLP systems that rely on upstream linguistic features, including fundamental NLP tasks such as token and sentence boundaries, part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency trees (Aharoni et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a; Taghizadeh and Faili, 2020; Zhu, 2020; Kanayama and Iwamoto, 2020; Nguyen and Nguyen, 2021). Building effective multilingual systems for these fundamental tasks has the potential to transform downstream NLP systems.\n\nSeveral NLP toolkits have been developed to address multilingualism for fundamental NLP tasks, including spaCy (1), UDify (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), Flair (Akbik et al., 2019), CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), UDPipe (Straka, 2018), and Stanza (Qi et al., 2020). However, these toolkits have limitations. For instance, spaCy prioritizes speed but sacrifices performance, while UDify and Flair require external tokenizers. CoreNLP supports raw text but does not offer state-of-the-art performance. UDPipe and Stanza leverage word embeddings to deliver current state-of-the-art performance for many languages, but their pipelines for different languages are trained separately and do not share components, resulting in increased memory usage.\n\nTo address these limitations, recent toolkits like UDPipe and Stanza have incorporated word embeddings, such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017). However, they do not explore contextualized embeddings from pre-trained transformer-based language models, which have been shown to significantly improve NLP task performance (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b; Conneau et al., 2020).\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Trankit, a multilingual Transformer-based NLP Toolkit that overcomes these limitations. Our toolkit can process raw text for fundamental NLP tasks, supporting 56 languages with 90 pre-trained pipelines on 90 treebanks of the Universal Dependency v2.5 (Zeman et al., 2019). By utilizing the state-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained transformer XLM-Roberta (Conneau et al., 2020), Trankit advances state-of-the-art performance for sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, morphological feature tagging, and dependency parsing while achieving competitive or better performance for tokenization, multi-word token expansion, and lemmatization over the 90 treebanks. Additionally, Trankit obtains competitive or better performance for named entity recognition (NER) on 11 public datasets.\n\nOne of the key features of Trankit is its wordpiece-based token and sentence splitter, which better exploits contextual information beneficial in many languages. For example, given the sentence \"John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah,\" Trankit correctly recognizes it as a single sentence, unlike character-based sentence splitters of Stanza and UDPipe, which are easily fooled by the exclamation mark.\n\nThe overall architecture of Trankit's pipeline features three novel transformer-based components: (i) the joint token and sentence splitter, (ii) the joint model for POS tagging, morphological tagging, and dependency parsing, and (iii) the named entity recognizer. However, one potential concern is the large memory usage of the pre-trained transformer model, particularly when processing multiple languages simultaneously. To address this issue, we introduce a novel plug-and-play mechanism with Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020a,b) that significantly reduces memory usage and training time.\n\nAdapters are small networks injected inside all layers of the pre-trained transformer model, allowing us to learn language-specific features for tasks while sharing a single pre-trained transformer across components and languages. During training, the shared pre-trained transformer is fixed while only the adapters and task-specific weights are updated. At inference time, depending on the language of the input text and the current active component, the corresponding trained adapter and task-specific weights are activated and plugged into the pipeline to process the input. This mechanism not only solves the memory problem but also substantially reduces the training time.\n\nOverall, Trankit is a comprehensive NLP toolkit that addresses the limitations of existing toolkits and achieves state-of-the-art performance for various NLP tasks, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on multilingual NLP applications."}}

They were still capable of going on walks, despite their advanced age, but our male bulldog had developed some breathing issues, making each step a laborious effort that required patience and care. He was always eager to explore new territory, and on this particular day, Ralphie and KC's carefree spirits were palpable as they bounded ahead, their little legs moving rapidly as they discovered the wonders of the forest. We were walking in the woods, expecting a casual twenty- to thirty-minute stroll, but the terrain's rugged beauty belied its unforgiving nature, and we found ourselves facing a more demanding excursion than anticipated. I was certain Ralphie and KC could handle the challenging terrain, but they turned out to be less agile than I had envisioned, their paws struggling to navigate the dense underbrush and uneven terrain as they fought to keep up with me. As we wandered deeper into the woods, I soon realized that we had strayed into unfamiliar territory and were lost, the forest seeming to stretch out endlessly in every direction, with no clear path in sight, and an unsettling sense of vulnerability settled over me. The only difference this time was that Ralphie and KC were panting and breathing heavily, their labored breathing heightening my anxiety, and the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and leaves that clung to their coats like a damp shroud, a stark contrast to their usual vibrant spirits. I had no idea how long we had been wandering through the woods, my sense of direction faltering as I tried to use my intuition to guide us back home, the trees seeming to blur together in a dizzying array of greens and browns that swirled around me like a vortex. As fear began to set in, I spotted a series of letters 'P' hanging from random tree branches\u2014a surreal and inexplicable sight that sent a shiver down my spine\u2014and I wondered if this was a sign from above, a message scrawled across the canvas of the forest like a cryptic work of art.

We were finally emerging from the woods and getting closer to home, where the warm sunlight and familiar sounds of the house brought relief to our weary souls, and a sense of comfort washed over me like a soothing balm, as I repeated the words \"almost there\" like a beacon of hope. Ralphie and KC were exhausted, their little bodies trembling with fatigue, as I stood there frozen in a mix of fear and hope, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum that threatened to burst free, overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment. We finally reached our destination, home, where the warmth and comfort of familiar surroundings brought relief to our weary souls, and a sense of comfort washed over me like a soothing balm, a welcome respite from the challenges we had faced in the forest. I spent the next hour picking at least a dozen ticks off each dog, and a gentle reprimand from my stepdad about taking them on long walks served as a reminder of the importance of taking care of our furry friends, and the love and concern that shone in his eyes was a balm to my frazzled nerves.

While they're both mid-aged and still capable of going on walks, Ralphie, in particular, struggles with breathing issues. Despite his limitations, he's always eager to explore unfamiliar territory. This particular walk was meant to be a casual stroll, lasting no more than twenty to thirty minutes. I was confident that both dogs could handle it, but my confidence quickly waned as we delved deeper into the woods and unfamiliar terrain.\n\nAs we walked, the trees seemed to close in around us, and the sound of nearby streams created an eerie atmosphere. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were lost, and the only reassurance I had was the presence of my two furry companions. However, even they seemed to be struggling, panting heavily and moving with a slowed pace. My anxiety grew, and I found myself questioning our route and the time we'd spent in the woods. I was starting to feel a sense of fear, and my internal sense of direction was failing me.\n\nIt was at this point that I received a sign that I never could have anticipated. Amidst the dense foliage, I spotted small pieces of felt hanging from tree branches, bearing the letters \"P\" and \"9.\" The sight seemed surreal and out of place, but something about it struck a chord within me. I took it as a sign from God and the angels, indicating that I should head in the direction indicated by the letters \u2013 to the left, roughly at the 9 o'clock position. With newfound hope, I urged my dogs forward, and we continued walking.\n\nHalf an hour passed, or so it seemed, and my dogs were nearing the end of their endurance. Ralphie and KC were exhausted, and their heavy breathing was a constant reminder of their struggles. However, with each step, I could sense that we were getting closer to familiar territory. \"Almost there!\" I kept telling myself and my dogs, trying to muster what little energy they had left. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we emerged from the woods and found ourselves back home.\n\nAs we returned, I was relieved to be safe and sound, but I was also aware of the toll the walk had taken on my dogs. I carefully removed at least a dozen ticks from each of them and received a minor scolding from my stepfather about taking them on long walks. While it wasn't my intention, I knew that we'd been given a blessing that day \u2013 a divine intervention that had guided us back home."}}

This phenomenon can manifest in various forms, ranging from overt derogation, where victims are likened to animals such as \"dogs\" or \"monkeys\" (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capacity for experiencing pain to certain individuals (Deska et al., 2020). The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997).\n\nDespite its significance, dehumanizing language has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature. This study evaluates the capability of leading pre-trained NLP models, specifically GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a), in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we assess the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content.\n\nOur findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, particularly for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees.\n\nFollowing our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, i.e., explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GPT models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models. Specifically, even the top-performing model achieved a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other hate speech types. This finding underscores the fact that annotating nuanced tasks like dehumanization still necessitates the expertise of human annotators.\n\nIt also highlights that the annotation of large-scale corpora with dehumanization labels represents an important and pivotal future direction for fostering collaboration between the fields of natural language processing and social science, enabling comprehensive research into this profoundly significant social phenomenon.\n\nI made minor adjustments to improve clarity, grammar, and formatting.

In general, all these models are initially pre-trained on massive data by unsupervised learning, and they often require additional training for two primary scenarios: continual pre-training on new data, as the pool of available pre-training data continuously expands (Gupta et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2023). Supervised Fine-Tuning, which involves training LLMs on labeled data to enhance their capacity to follow human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023; Ansell et al., 2024), is another crucial aspect of their development. In contrast to initial pre-training, additional training demands relatively less time and computational resources.

However, additional training is often required in two primary scenarios: (1) continual pre-training on new data as the available pre-training data continues to expand (Gupta et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2023), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on labeled data to enhance the model's ability to follow human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023; Ansell et al., 2024). In contrast to initial pre-training, additional training demands relatively less time and computational resources. Nevertheless, it remains challenging due to the substantial parameter count (Zhao et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2023).\n\nFortunately, researchers are exploring methods to save additional training costs. One such approach is Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods (Ansell et al., 2024; Lialin et al., 2023), which is commonly employed in SFT scenarios but not in continual pre-training. To address this gap, we aim to accelerate additional training scenarios for LLMs by leveraging the structural sparsity inherent in pre-trained models.\n\nResearchers have observed that slower-activated (important) neurons exhibit sparsity in each forward iteration (Zhang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2023). By omitting the calculation of inactive (unimportant) neurons, we can accelerate training. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which depicts a compact and efficient neuron importance assessment module that evaluates the activation status of neurons in advance. By discarding inactive neurons, training speed is enhanced.\n\nHowever, disregarding inactive neurons poses three additional challenges: (1) determining the method of neurons to discard, (2) assessing whether omitting neurons harms model performance, and (3) evaluating the effectiveness of the approach in real additional training scenarios. To address these challenges, we borrowed and extended several famous neuron importance evaluation metrics (Liu et al., 2023; Han et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2023) within the context of transformer pruning. We conducted extensive experiments on TinyLlama-1.1B (Zhang et al., 2024) to determine the optimal approach, including using maxip (a neuron importance metric) to assess neuron importance, adopting sampling (versus top-k) neuron selection strategy, and introducing a ladder omission rate scheduler.\n\nWe separately conducted experiments over Llama-2 (7B and 13B) in both standard and sparsity-accelerated manners for both continual pre-training and SFT scenarios. Evaluation results on several benchmarks show that our approach, called Structural Acceleration Technique (SAT), achieves comparable or even better performance compared to normal training. Moreover, SAT can obtain about 45% throughput improvement for continual pre-training and 38% speedup in elapsed time for SFT.\n\nThis work contributes to the following three aspects: (1) designing a novel ladder omission rate scheduler to alleviate the overfitting problem of SAT, (2) developing a neuron importance evaluation metric that assesses the importance of neurons, and (3) introducing a sampling-based neuron selection strategy that outperforms the top-k approach.\n\nChanges made:\n\n1.

To make the most of your time, consider setting your alarm to go off at least ten minutes earlier than normal, allowing you to complete the de-icing process without feeling rushed, which will, in turn, give you a sense of accomplishment and a head start on your day. However, if you're in a pinch and don't have access to a professional de-icer, there are a few household ingredients you can use as a homemade substitute, but only use those as a last resort and be aware of their potential limitations, including the risk of damaging your vehicle's paint and other surfaces. For the best results, opt for a product specifically designed to de-ice your vehicle without causing any damage, such as a propylene glycol-based de-icer, and always stock up on some professionally-made de-icer before winter arrives to ensure you're prepared, taking into account the importance of having a reliable and effective de-icer on hand. De-icer can be easily found online, at auto parts stores, and in the automotive sections of stores like Walmart and Target, so you can stock up and stay prepared for the winter months, and it's a good idea to check the product's instructions and reviews before making a purchase to ensure you're choosing the best de-icer for your needs. To effectively de-ice your windshield and other windows, start by giving them a generous spray of your de-icer, covering the entire surface to ensure a thorough de-icing process, and make sure to wear protective gloves and eyewear to avoid exposure to the de-icer's harsh chemicals. Begin at the top and work your way down to the bottom, allowing the de-icer to run down the windows and cover more ice without wasting excess product, and use a gentle, even motion to prevent streaks and marks on the glass, which can be achieved by applying a consistent amount of pressure and moving the scraper in a smooth, sweeping motion. When it comes to removing the ice, it's essential to use an ice scraper, as other tools can damage your windows, and use a sharp, sturdy scraper to prevent scratching the glass and ensure a smooth removal process. Apply plenty of pressure with each stroke, and scrape as far as you can reach in one long, continuous motion, taking care not to chip away at the glass underneath, and make sure to scrape in a direction that follows the curve of the glass to avoid creating scratches. Use the scraper's brush end (or a separate brush if it doesn't have one) to clear the loose ice off the window, and if the ice is being stubborn, spray it with more de-icer to loosen it up instead of hacking away at it, which can cause damage to the glass and surrounding surfaces. If your reach is short, choose a scraper with a nice long handle to extend it further, making it easier to clear the ice without straining yourself, and look for a scraper with a comfortable grip and a sturdy handle to reduce fatigue, which can be caused by using a heavy or unwieldy scraper. Resist the urge to leave the passenger-side of your windshield and all the other windows as they are, and instead, fight that urge and take the time to remove all the ice, ensuring a clear field of vision when driving, which is essential for your safety and the safety of others on the road. Keep in mind that local laws may require you to clear all windows, including side mirrors, and even if they don't, it's essential to comply with safety regulations and clear all windows to maintain clear vision while driving, which can help prevent accidents and reduce the risk of fines and penalties. Don't limit your field of vision when driving by neglecting to clear all windows, including side mirrors, as this can pose a significant risk to your safety on the road, and make sure to check your rearview and side mirrors as well to ensure they are clear of ice and snow. Now that all the ice has been cleared from the windshield, make sure the wipers haven't frozen to them, and if necessary, spray them with de-icer to loosen any stubborn ice, and check the wipers' blades for any signs of damage or wear.

Set the wipers back down into place, and when you start the car, turn them on to make sure they function normally, ensuring a safe and smooth driving experience, and check the wipers' blades for any signs of wear or damage before embarking on your journey. Your windows are the most obvious things that need to be cleared, but don't forget that local laws probably state that other areas, such as tail lights, headlights, turn signals, and license plates, also need to be de-iced, and make sure to check your vehicle's owner's manual for specific instructions on how to clear these areas. Once the big job is done, take a moment to scan your car to see if ice or snow is blocking anything else that needs to be uncovered, such as tail lights, headlights, turn signals, and license plates, and take the necessary steps to de-ice these areas as well, and make sure to check your vehicle's mirrors and other exterior components for any signs of damage or wear.

A crucial aspect of this is recognizing the diacritic marks above the letters a, e, i, o, and u, which indicate long and short vowels. In Latin, short vowels are represented by \u0103, \u0115, \u012d, \u014f, \u016d, while long vowels are represented by \u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b. These diacritical marks are not part of the spelling of the word, but rather serve to indicate the correct pronunciation. When writing Latin, you wouldn't include these marks.\n\nTo pronounce \"love\" in Latin accurately, focus on the correct pronunciation of long vowels. \n\n- \u0101: pronounced like the 'a' in \"father,\" not the '\u00e6' in \"fat\" or the '\u0259' in \"apart.\"\n- \u0113: pronounced like the 'e' in \"they,\" but longer, not like the 'ei' in \"they,\" the '\u0259' in \"apart,\" or the 'i:' in \"ecology.\"\n- \u012b: pronounced like the 'i' in \"sheep,\" not like 'ai.'\n- \u014d: pronounced like the 'o' in Italian \"amore.\"\n- \u016b: pronounced like the English word \"root,\" not like the 'ju:' in \"you\" or the French/French \"u\" or German \"\u00fc.\"\n\nThe infinitive form of the Latin verb \"to love\" is \"am\u0101re,\" which serves as the basis for conjugating the verb to find its other forms. Latin grammar can be complex, with many conjugations affecting the word greatly. Here are the main conjugations for the present tense to get you started:\n\n- First person singular: \"am\u014d.\"\n- Second person singular: \"am\u0101s.\"\n- Third person singular: \"amat.\"\n- First person plural: \"am\u0101mus.\"\n- Second person plural: \"am\u0101tis.\"\n- Third person plural: \"amant.\"\n\nThere are six tenses in Latin: present, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, future, and future perfect. The imperfect tense describes actions continuing in the past, the perfect tense describes actions completed in the past, and the pluperfect tense is used to describe something that happened before other actions in the past. Here's how you say \"love\" in the first person singular, second person singular, third person singular, and first person plural in these tenses:\n\n- Imperfect: \"am\u0101bam\" - \"am\u0101b\u0101s\" - \"am\u0101bat\" - \"am\u0101b\u0101mus.\"\n- Perfect: \"am\u0101v\u012b\" - \"am\u0101vist\u012b\" - \"am\u0101vit\" - \"am\u0101vimus.\"\n- Pluperfect: \"am\u0101veram\" - \"am\u0101ver\u0101s\" - \"am\u0101verat\" - \"amaveramus.\"\n\nLatin has two tenses for things happening in the future: the future tense and the future perfect tense. The future perfect tense is used to describe things that will be finished sometime in the future, whereas the future tense is used to describe actions taking place in the future. Here's how you say \"love\" in the first person singular, second person singular, third person singular, and first person plural in these future tenses:\n\n- Future: \"am\u0101b\u014d\" - \"am\u0101bis\" - \"am\u0101bit\" - \"am\u0101bimus.\"\n- Future Perfect: \"am\u0101ver\u014d\" - \"am\u0101veris\" - \"am\u0101verit\" - \"amaverimus.\"\n\nIn addition to the six tenses and three persons (first person, second person, and third person), Latin verbs also have four moods (indicative, infinitive, subjunctive, and imperative) and two voices (active and passive). If you want to study Latin verb grammar in more detail, you'll need to spend time getting on top of these variations, as they are at the heart of what makes Latin the language it is. To get to grips with Latin stylistics, you'll also need to study verbal modifications.\n\n\"Love\" is not only a verb but also a noun, and it's a masculine noun with the nominative singular form \"amor\" in Latin. As with the verbs, the noun has variations that change depending on the case and whether it's singular or plural. Here are the forms for the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, and vocative cases:\n\n- Singular: \"amor\" - \"amoris\" - \"amori\" - \"amorem\" - \"amore\" - \"amor.\"\n- Plural: \"amores\" - \"amorum\" - \"amoribus\" - \"amores\" - \"amoribus\" - \"amores.\"\n\nNote: There are minor changes in punctuation and a few minor changes in word order and additional commas to improve clarity."}}

Don't assume your body has the same skin type as your face either. Sometimes the skin on your body is drier or more acne-prone than the skin on your face, which is why determining your body's distinct skin type is crucial. To effectively moisturize and care for your body, look for lotions that include the best ingredients for your skin type, and that's exactly what you should do after identifying it. This is why it's especially important to first determine your body skin type, since assuming it is the same as your face could mean applying ingredients that could damage the skin or cause breakouts, which can have adverse effects. Now that you know your body skin type, here are some key ingredients to look for in your lotion. For normal skin, consider thicker lotions or moisturizing creams that include ingredients like vitamin C to help manage antioxidant damage and vitamin E to hydrate the skin, as well as licorice, which can help reduce any pigmentation damage. For oily skin, use lightweight, non-greasy formulas, especially those that are fast absorbing or contain witch hazel, which is a great natural ingredient for reducing excess oil production and body acne by unclogging pores, and avoid thick, greasy products or those that contain alcohol or petrolatum. For dry skin, look for thick cream-based lotions or healing ointments that contain shea butter or coconut oil, two intensely moisturizing ingredients that repair the skin's moisture barrier, and steer clear of products that contain alcohol, which will dry out the skin further. For sensitive skin, consider products that contain soothing ingredients like Echinacea to calm the skin and avocado oil, which contains fatty acids and tons of vitamin B to moisturize the skin and regulate cell function, and avoid products that contain chemicals, dyes, or perfumes. For combination skin, look for oil-free formulas containing panthenol, zinc oxide, and lycopene, and avoid thick creams and water-based gels, which will be too heavy or drying for the combination areas. When applying lotion to your body, start by warming it up in your hands, then apply it gently to your skin, focusing on areas that are particularly dry, like the knees and elbows, and before exiting the steamy bathroom or putting on clothes, allow the lotion about 5 minutes to fully absorb into your skin."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 20.570261001586914, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -1.8595095872879028, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Choosing the right body lotion is crucial for maintaining healthy and hydrated skin.

The humidity will keep your pores open, allowing the lotion to penetrate faster and hydrate your skin more effectively.

English song and movie titles are often directly embedded in Chinese responses due to the increasing popularity of Chinese subtitles, the rising demand for bilingual entertainment content, and the desire of users to access a wide range of content in multiple languages. A straightforward approach to building a bilingual TTS system is to collect speech data from bilingual speakers, as this provides a more natural and authentic representation of language patterns and nuances that are characteristic of multilingual individuals, allowing developers to capture the complexities of language use in multilingual contexts and create more accurate and engaging voice assistants. However, mixed-lingual corpora are scarce because they require a large number of speakers who can produce high-quality speech samples in multiple languages, which is a challenging and time-consuming task that demands significant resources and expertise, making it difficult to collect and annotate the necessary data. Another approach is to utilize monolingual speech data from various speakers, which allows for the collection of a large amount of data with minimal resources and effort, enabling developers to leverage existing data sources and reduce the burden of collecting new data. Generally, each speaker speaks only one language, leading to speaker and language characteristics being highly correlated because the acoustic properties of speech are closely tied to the speaker's linguistic background and individual characteristics, such as accent, tone, and pitch, which can result in language-specific patterns and variations. Using only monolingual corpora for bilingual or multilingual TTS easily leads to heavy accent carry-over in synthesized speech or inconsistent voice between languages, as the model may struggle to capture the unique characteristics of language use in multilingual contexts and may produce speech that sounds unnatural or stilted. Actually, a bilingual corpus helps deal with the problem of accent carry-over and inconsistent voice by providing a more balanced and accurate representation of language use in multilingual contexts, allowing developers to create voice assistants that can adapt to different languages and cultural backgrounds. To address the challenge of capturing language nuances in multilingual contexts, we propose embedding a mask to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and phonology embedding for focusing on expression between different phonology of English, which enables the model to capture the unique characteristics of language use in multilingual contexts and improve the overall user experience by creating more natural and engaging speech patterns. Our experiments show that the static and dynamic components in ESM can control different attributes of phonology, such as tone, pitch, and stress, which enables the model to generate more nuanced and accurate speech patterns in English and cater to the diverse needs of users who speak multiple languages by allowing the model to adapt to different language styles and cultural backgrounds. Phonology decomposition and control can make a significant contribution to more standard spoken English expression and better performance in different scenarios by allowing the model to capture and generate the unique characteristics of language use in multilingual contexts and create voice assistants that can interact with users in a more natural and engaging way.

For instance, it is common for Chinese responses to directly include the names of English songs and movies. A straightforward approach to building a bilingual TTS system is to collect speech data from bilingual speakers. [1] proposed a shared hidden Markov model (HMM)-based bilingual TTS system, utilizing a Mandarin-English corpus recorded by a bilingual speaker. [2] presented a TTS system using a speaker and language factorized deep neural network (DNN) with a corpus of three bilingual speakers. However, mixed-lingual corpora are scarce, whereas large numbers of monolingual corpora are readily available. Another viable approach is to leverage monolingual speech data from different speakers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. [5] proposed a polyglot synthesis method that adapts the shared HMM states to the target speaker, trained on monolingual corpora. [6] suggested factorizing speaker and language based on an HMM-based parametric TTS system. [7] utilized a combined phonetic space in two languages to build a codeswitched TTS system based on HMM. [8] mapped senones between two monolingual corpora in two languages with a speaker-independent DNN ASR output based on HMM TTS.\n\nEnd-to-end TTS systems have also been extended to multilingual tasks using monolingual speech [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. [13] employed Unicode bytes as a unified new language representation for multilingual TTS, utilizing 125 hours of speech and achieving the ability to read codeswitching text despite speaker inconsistency when cross-language. [14] trained with designed loss terms that preserved the speaker's identity in multiple languages based on the VoiceLoop architecture [17]. The trained speech was recorded by 410 monolingual speakers from English, Spanish, and German. [15] used an adversarial loss term to disentangle speaker identity from the speech content, which was trained with 550 hours of speech from 92 monolingual speakers. Limited by corpus size, [16] proposed tone embedding and tone classifier for tone preservation to generate utterances in a proper prosodic accent of the target language.\n\nHowever, using only monolingual corpora for bilingual or multilingual TTS can lead to heavy accent carry-over in synthesized speech or inconsistent voice between languages. Bilingual corpora can help alleviate this issue. [18] trained a TTS system that transformed speaker embedding between languages from a bilingual speaker to other monolingual speakers for a high degree of naturalness. In this paper, we aim to utilize scarce bilingual corpora to acquire more standard spoken English from a monolingual speaker, which is highly correlated with phonology learning.\n\nFor example, in mixed-lingual utterances, the pronunciation of English by a non-native speaker, such as Chinese, is strongly influenced by their native language and is often different from the standard English pronunciation [19]. Mandarin derives pronunciation directly from the spellings of the word with different tones, which have a high grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) correlation. In contrast, English is an alphabetic and highly non-phonemic language. Native phonemic language speakers, whose pronunciation is influenced by the spelling of the word, often pronounce English words differently from standard English speakers [20]. In mixed-lingual utterances, these speakers, despite being qualified bilingual speakers, generally replace some English phonemes with the closest phoneme in their native language, resulting in mispronunciation and differences in phonology like articulation change and intonation variation [21].\n\nGiven these challenges, building a state-of-the-art bilingual TTS system requires special designs to handle the English differences in phonology between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances. In this paper, our contributions include:\n\n1.  Introducing phonology embedding to capture the English differences between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances;\n2.  Proposing an embedding mask to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and phonology embedding for focusing on expression between different phonology of English;\n3.  Designing an embedding strength modulator (ESM) to capture the dynamic information of language and phonology, which helps to generate more standard spoken English speech;\n4.  Experiments showing that static and dynamic components in ESM can control different attributes of phonology.\n\nPhonology decomposition and control can make a significant contribution to more standard spoken English expression and better performance in different scenarios.\n\n**Figure 1.** Overview of the proposed bilingual architecture with specially designed modules marked in yellow color."}}

This proficiency is attributed to their training on vast corpora composed of texts from various languages (OpenAI, 2023; Shi et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023). However, these datasets often have an English-centric bias, with English content dominating the majority of the data (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Workshop et al., 2023). This imbalance can hinder the models' proficiency in other languages, leading to suboptimal performance in non-English contexts (Ahuja et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b).\n\nTo address this issue, researchers have explored strategies to enhance the performance of English-centric LLMs in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One effective approach involves translating training or test data into English (Conneau et al., 2018; Ponti et al., 2020; Artetxe et al., 2023; Moghe et al., 2023). Recent studies have expanded this idea by incorporating translation into the intermediate stages of prompting LLMs (Huang et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Etxaniz et al., 2023) for multilingual NLP tasks.\n\nFor instance, Shi et al. (2022) demonstrated that translating test questions into English enhances performance on multilingual reasoning tasks, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). Similarly, Huang et al. (2023) and Etxaniz et al. (2023) showed that prompting LLMs to first translate or comprehend questions in English, then solve them step by step, improves performance. However, the effectiveness of translation on multilingual task performance remains underexplored, particularly in real-world user requests in various languages.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, we hypothesize that English-centric LLMs generally perform better with English translations of prompts, while \"Multilingual LLMs\" excel with native prompts, particularly for tasks highly dependent on language. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the utility of translation with large language models for various scenarios. Firstly, we compare translating multilingual tasks into English with an optional step of translating responses back into the original languages (i.e., the \"translate-test\" method) against several baselines on multilingual NLP tasks. Secondly, we extend the evaluation to real user queries, which are more likely to contain knowledge related to culture and language. Thirdly, we broaden the scope of LLM evaluations to include non-English-centric models to explore how they differ in behavior from English-centric LLMs.\n\nOur results demonstrate that simply translating queries into English can already achieve the best results in multiple NLP task categories. For real user queries, the effect of translation depends on the languages and the LLMs. When working with advanced LLMs and certain languages, employing prompts in native languages appears to be the more effective strategy. The non-English-centric LLMs also behave differently from English-centric LLMs, where prompts in the native languages yield superior results by capturing the nuances related to culture and language.\n\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We compare various multilingual prompting strategies in NLP tasks, finding that translation remains a strong baseline even for LLMs. Our study also identifies factors that affect performance in multilingual tasks.\n\u2022 We broaden our multilingual evaluation to encompass actual user queries and LLMs that are not primarily centered on English, thereby addressing the limitations of previous works.\n\u2022 Our study reveals the shortcomings of current multilingual evaluations, underscoring the need for more comprehensive assessments that broaden the range of benchmarks and diversify the types of LLMs considered.\n\nChanges made:\n\n1.

When our son Jackson started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately, which set the stage for the difficulties to come and raised serious concerns about his academic and social development. He struggled to remain seated during circle time and had trouble regulating his impulses, which led to persistent issues with keeping his hands and feet to himself, causing disruptions to his classmates and teachers alike. This behavior was also evident in his tendency to flit from one activity to the next, hastily scribbling on a piece of paper before abandoning it in favor of something else, leaving a trail of unfinished work and disappointed teachers in his wake. He struggled to maintain focus long enough to complete his work, and the effects of his inattentiveness were compounded by his tendency to misplace his belongings, forget assignments, and struggle to follow instructions, which created a significant amount of stress for both him and his teachers. Unfortunately, his disruptiveness during church services became increasingly embarrassing, leading us to eventually stop attending due to the noise and commotion he caused, which was a difficult decision for us as a family but ultimately necessary to maintain a sense of peace and respect for others. Despite our best efforts to discipline him, set boundaries, and accommodate his misbehavior, we felt like we were failing him, and the resulting stress and anxiety took a profound toll on our relationship and overall well-being, causing us to question our ability to provide a stable and supportive environment for him. That was four months ago, and my husband and I are still grappling with the weighty decision of whether or not to medicate our son Jackson, a choice that will have a profound impact on his future and one that weighs heavily on our minds, filling us with a mix of hope and trepidation as we consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this life-changing decision. I've spoken to numerous friends and family members who either have ADHD or have children with the disorder, and their experiences have provided us with valuable insights into the complexities of this condition, which has helped us better understand the challenges that Jackson faces and the potential benefits of treatment. Parents I've spoken to almost universally praise the positive effects of medication, citing improved focus, concentration, and reduced need for redirection, but also acknowledge potential drawbacks, such as a loss of appetite that can be as distressing as it is inconvenient, a trade-off that they've found to be worth it in the end. Feedback from those with ADHD who have taken medication has been mixed, with some reporting feelings of depression and others citing a lack of appetite as the most significant side effect, which has left us wondering how our son Jackson would respond to treatment. They all agree, however, that medication has helped them stay focused, complete tasks, and interact more easily with peers, a reality that has left us wondering if the same benefits would extend to our son Jackson, who is still struggling to find his footing in school and in life. My husband and I remain undecided about whether medication would be beneficial for Jackson, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks, and considering the profound impact it could have on his life, which is a difficult and emotional decision that we're not taking lightly. Do the benefits of medication outweigh the costs, and are we prepared to take the risk of altering Jackson's brain and mental state for the potential benefits, or will we choose a different path, one that is filled with uncertainty and doubt but also with the promise of a more stable and secure future for our son?

My husband and I had long recognized that Jackson had difficulty occupying himself at home, a challenge that led us to stop attending church due to his disruptiveness during services.  He would often crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and yawn loudly during sermons.

However, the feedback from those who have ADHD and have taken medication has been more mixed.  Some have reported experiencing depression once their medication regime began, while others have identified decreased appetite as the worst side effect.

This burgeoning search paradigm casts the information-seeking process into multi-turn dialogues with conversational agents, which are designed to facilitate the exploration and gradual narrowing down of the search scope to relevant information items (Aliannejadi et al., 2021; Schneider et al., 2023). A fundamental aspect of these agents is their ability to access data stored in knowledge bases with an inherent semantic structure, such as relational databases or knowledge graphs. Consequently, a key challenge lies in bridging the gap between natural language utterances, where users express their information needs, and corresponding formal representations, such as logical forms or executable queries.\n\nIn the field of natural language processing (NLP), the task of semantic parsing focuses on this problem by deriving machine-readable meaning representations given linguistic inputs. Conversational question answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs is a specialized facet of conversational search that revolves around responding to user queries in a dialogue given an underlying knowledge graph. Through semantic parsing mechanisms, dialogue utterances are transformed into executable queries to retrieve answer triples from a graph. Semantic parsing regarding question answering has been extensively studied over numerous years, with approaches ranging from rule-based to supervised neural network-based techniques.\n\nWith the advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), the field of NLP has witnessed a significant shift in methodologies. Unlike conventional supervised learning approaches that rely on annotated datasets, LLMs are trained in a self-supervised manner, predicting tokens within vast amounts of unlabeled data. Combined with scaling up model size and training corpora, this approach has demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities of LLMs and their prowess in multi-task learning (Radford et al., 2019). Given a carefully defined input prompt, LLMs have the advantage of prompt-based learning, or in-context learning, which allows them to perform a range of generative tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, or semantic parsing (Liu et al., 2023).\n\nOwing to their contextual language understanding and versatile language generation capabilities, LLMs have experienced rapid adoption in applications related to conversational search, such as personal voice assistants, web browsers, or enterprise chatbots. There has been a growing interest in optimizing LLMs for conversational interactions using instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (OpenAI, 2022). Although LLMs offer tremendous potential, it is crucial to acknowledge their inherent limitations, such as the risk of hallucinating or omitting information and a lack of accountability in high-risk scenarios, with limited transparency of the information sources from which they derive their outputs (Ji et al., 2023).\n\nTherefore, it becomes imperative to ground their generated outputs in verifiable facts contained in knowledge bases, which can be facilitated through semantic parsing. The goal of our study lies in investigating how LLMs perform in semantic parsing of dialogues for CQA over knowledge graphs. To answer this question, we systematically compare generated outputs from LLMs of varying sizes and training objectives, with a primary focus on models optimized for conversational interaction.

A firm but not crushing handshake is a good way to make a positive impression.\n- Stand in a \"power pose.\" This involves standing with your legs slightly apart, hands on hips, and arms bent out slightly at the elbows. This stance can help you feel more confident and assertive.\n\nAnother important aspect of being classy is showing genuine interest in others. This can be achieved by:\n\n- Giving sincere compliments. However, be mindful of the type of compliments you give. Instead of focusing on physical features, compliment people on their accomplishments or personality traits. For example, \"You look so elegant today!\" or \"I heard you just landed a promotion; congratulations!\"\n- Paying attention to details about people's lives, such as their birthdays, interests, or accomplishments. This shows that you value and appreciate them as individuals.\n\nWhen interacting with others, it's essential to be charismatic but not dominating. Give others a chance to speak and ask them questions to show that you care about what they have to say. Some examples of questions you can ask include:\n\n- \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" or \"What's your favorite hobby?\"\n- \"Have you traveled anywhere exciting recently?\" or \"What are some places on your bucket list?\"\n- \"What do you like to do to relax?\" or \"Do you have any fun plans for the upcoming weekend?\"\n\nWhen engaging in conversations, take things slow and be genuine. A classy individual starts by asking how the other person is doing and then moves on to natural topics of conversation. For instance, if you're at a wedding, you could start by asking the person next to you if they're enjoying themselves. Ask questions, like \"So is this your first time in the area?\" to show you are interested in them.\n\nIf you're taking someone out, make them feel special by going out of your way to show you appreciate them. Here are some tips:\n\n- Call your dates instead of just texting them. This shows that you're willing to take the time to talk to them.\n- Be on time for dates. If there's something causing you to run late, let them know as soon as possible.\n- Make a plan for the date instead of just meeting up and saying \"So what do you want to do?\"\n- Don't push your date into doing anything they don't want to do.\n\nIn a long-term relationship, showing classiness is just as important. Here are some tips:\n\n- Make time to listen to your partner. Ask them how their day was, for starters.\n- Remember big dates like birthdays and anniversaries. Try to do something special for them.\n- Go for the little everyday gestures that mean a lot, such as writing love notes, picking up their favorite dinner, or surprising them with tickets to their favorite concert.\n\nBy following these tips, you can become a more classy and charismatic individual who attracts people to you without trying too hard."}}

Cloth measuring tapes are typically found in sewing kits and craft stores, where they're often soft and flexible, measuring up to five feet. You can find sewing kits at most big box stores and drug stores, or print a tape measure off the internet with a simple online search, and then use it to create a usable tape by cutting it apart, aligning the edges, and gluing or taping them together carefully. To ensure an accurate measurement, use flexible materials that will hold their shape, and avoid stiff materials that can distort the tape. To get an accurate reading, wrap the tape around your body tightly enough that you can only fit a finger underneath, then check in the mirror to ensure the tape is straight and not twisted. Once you've measured your hips, record the measurement and save it for later, along with your bust, waist, and inseam measurements, depending on the project you're working on, and remember that skin-tight clothing would be difficult to move in. This is because you need to add inches to your measurements to achieve a wearable and comfortable fit, taking into account the desired design and the amount of stretch in the fabric. When adding inches to your measurements, consider the desired design and the amount of stretch in the fabric, as most patterns will provide guidance on this, and if you have a curvier figure, you may also want to add extra inches for a more comfortable fit."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 19.332317352294922, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.027973651885986, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's a polished version of the text:\n\nTo measure your hips, follow these steps:\n\n1. Hold one end of the tape measure on one hip. It doesn't matter which side you start with. For ease, you can also pull the tape measure closer to your middle if that's more comfortable for you. Make sure you hold onto the end as you bring the other end around.\n\nYou can use a cloth measuring tape, which is a soft and flexible tool found in sewing kits and craft stores. Most measuring tapes have a range of 5 feet or so. If you can't find a cloth measuring tape in stores, you can also print one off the internet. Simply cut the printed tape apart, align the edges, and glue or tape them together. When using a printed tape measure, be careful not to stretch or rip it, as it can be prone to damage. However, avoid using cardstock as it may be too stiff to provide an accurate measurement.\n\nMetal measuring tapes, often used for DIY projects, are not suitable for body measurements. They are too rigid and will not give you an accurate reading.\n\nTo measure your hips, wrap the tape measure around your backside, ensuring it doesn't twist. You can start by holding both ends of the tape measure and stepping over it to position it on your backside. This can be helpful if you have trouble wrapping the tape measure around your body.\n\nOnce you've wrapped the tape measure around your hips, check your reflection in the mirror to ensure it's parallel to the floor and not twisted. Make sure it looks even, and you may need to shift your position to check the back side of the tape measure.\n\nWhen measuring, the tape measure should be snug around your hips, but not constricting your circulation. You should be able to fit no more than one finger underneath the tape measure. To find your measurement, locate the point where the end of the tape meets a number as the tape measure comes around.\n\nWrite down your hip measurement for future reference, as you'll need to take other measurements, such as your bust, thigh, waist, and inseam, to make clothing.\n\nTo measure your thigh, locate the thickest part of your leg and wrap the tape measure around it. The inseam is the distance from your crotch to where you want your pants to fall. If you have a pair of pants that fit this length, you can measure the inseam on the pants rather than your body.\n\nWhen creating clothing, you won't use your exact measurements, as this would result in skin-tight garments that are difficult to move in. Instead, you'll add a few inches to make the clothing more wearable.\n\nThere are two reasons to add inches: to create a design and to make the clothing more wearable. For instance, if you want a flowing, poofy skirt, you may add more inches at the hip than for an A-line skirt. The amount of stretch in the fabric also affects how many inches you add. If the fabric is particularly stretchy, you may not need to add as many inches.\n\nMost patterns will guide you on how many inches to add. However, if you're creating clothing from scratch, you can add 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10 cm), depending on the desired fit. If you're curvier, you may want to add more inches to allow for better movement."}}

The text representations learned by these models transform text into a high-dimensional semantic space (Mikolov et al., 2013). In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals, such as EEG and fMRI signals, have been widely recognized to represent a snapshot of cognitive representations of language in the human brain (Xu et al., 2016). These signals record human brain activities during the cognitive processing of language and play a crucial role in revealing the internal workings of human language cognition (Friederici, 2011). It is natural to ask: how similar are these two different modalities of language representations (LLMs representations and cognitive language processing signals in the brain)? Or do LLMs mirror human cognitive language processing? Answering these questions may facilitate our understanding of LLMs from a cognitive science perspective.\n\nPrevious studies have explored the assessment of consistency between representations learned by pre-trained language models and cognitive processing signals (Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Hollenstein et al., 2019a; Abnar et al., 2019). Recent studies have compared human neuroimaging data with representations learned by pre-trained language models that are smaller than 1B-sized LLMs, revealing that language models with stronger predictive abilities for the next word exhibit greater alignment with the human brain (Schrimpf et al., 2021). However, current LLMs have scaled up their model size by hundreds of times (e.g., LLaMa3-400B+ (Meta, 2024)), and have been strengthened by alignment training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). These factors contribute significantly to the enhanced capabilities of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023b). Nevertheless, it is yet to be tested whether the latest LLMs with scales of 7B and above maintain consistency with human cognitive data. Additionally, the impact of pre-training data size, alignment training, prompts, and other training strategies on LLM-brain similarity has not been investigated.\n\nThis paper aims to assess the extent to which LLMs mirror cognitive language processing activity and subsequently analyze the impacts of different factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training) on such LLM-brain alignment. Specifically, we adopt functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals as human cognitive language processing signals, and RSA (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), widely used in neuroscience (Connolly et al., 2012; Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017), to compute similarity scores between LLM representations and human cognitive language processing signals. The framework for LLM-brain similarity computation is depicted in Figure 1. Our experiments comprise 23 open-source LLMs, trained with various pre-training data sizes, scaling, and training strategies (i.e., pre-training, SFT, RLHF), to investigate the impact of these factors on LLM-brain similarity. We further analyze the impact of prompts on the human intention understanding abilities of LLMs and the consistency between LLM sentiment and human sentiment. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between the capability of LLM evaluations and LLM-brain similarity.\n\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We employ human cognitive language processing signals to assess the resemblance between LLMs and human cognition. By analyzing the similarity of 23 LLMs to human cognitive language processing, we investigate the impact of various factors, such as pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts, on the LLM-brain similarity.\n\u2022 We find that explicit-prompts result in a higher LLM-brain similarity compared to no-prompts, indicating that explicit prompts can enhance the alignment of LLMs with human intentions.\n\u2022 Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high similarity to brain cognitive language processing in positive sentiment, suggesting that LLMs may encode more positive sentimental text during training.\n\u2022 We observe a high degree of consistency between the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) and LLM-brain similarity, indicating that the LLM-brain similarity holds substantial potential to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs.\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n- Improved sentence structure and grammar\n- Added transitions and connections between ideas\n- Clarified the purpose and significance of the study\n- Used more precise and technical language in the field of natural language processing and cognitive science\n- Standardized citation formatting\n- Reformatted the text to improve readability"}}

The incorporation of these models into solutions and products has led practitioners to eagerly explore their potential in tasks such as powering conversational agents and text classification, as well as public health applications, driving innovation in areas like medical diagnosis and patient engagement. However, understanding the internal processes of large language models remains a complex challenge, which is closely tied to the next issue, a significant hurdle that researchers are still working to overcome.

Primarily, considering the enormous volume and scale of data used to train LLMs, the likelihood of these bias-testing templates being included \u2013 even inadvertently \u2013 in subsequent LLMs is high. Moreover, human biases are non-ergodic; they evolve over time, further undermining the effectiveness of template-based approaches.\n\nThis paper presents a method that minimizes dependency on templates, identifying the stereotypes LLMs are familiar with and evaluating biases in the models' knowledge base. Given the copious amounts of text utilized in training LLMs, it is inevitable that they have been exposed to historical biases, and understanding the specific biases embedded during training is crucial. The first contribution of this study is a methodology for mapping the stereotype knowledge inherent in an LLM. We propose an approach for automatically constructing knowledge graphs that capture the biases present within any arbitrary LLM's knowledge. This approach enables the identification and representation of biases that an LLM contains about specific groups, and represents those biases in a knowledge graph. This system is indifferent to the type of group \u2013 be it gender, race, or social class \u2013 and can automatically construct a knowledge graph for any category.\n\nExposure to bias does not necessarily mean that an LLM will internalize or \"believe\" those biases. In other words, it may possess knowledge about these biases but may not necessarily apply them in its output. The second contribution of this study lies in examining the biases within the extracted LLM knowledge. We propose an automated strategy that assesses the outputs concerning any set of groups.

Many such algorithms learn complex, black-box mappings between input and output, which can be challenging to interpret and understand.

It is challenging to quantify the confidence of a mapping across different inputs, which can lead to a range of issues and limitations, including overfitting and underfitting. We need systems that can learn accurate mappings and quantify uncertainty in their predictions, making them essential for making reliable and informed decisions. Uncertainties arise in various situations when applying machine learning models, especially when the collected data is noisy or incomplete. One approach to quantify uncertainty associated with model parameters is Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which represent model weights as probability distributions over possible values, making it easier to estimate uncertainty. This approach has been successfully applied in various real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential for improving model performance and reducing uncertainty. According to Blundell et al.

However, it is challenging to quantify how confident a certain mapping is with respect to different inputs, resulting in de\ufb01ciencies that lead to AI safety and social bias issues, such as the failures of auto-piloting systems. Therefore, we need systems that can not only learn accurate mappings but also quantify con\ufb01dence levels or uncertainties of their predictions. With uncertainty information available, many issues mentioned above can be effectively handled.\n\nThere are many situations where uncertainties arise when applying machine learning models. First, we are uncertain about whether the structure choice and model parameters can best describe the data distribution, which is referred to as model uncertainty or epistemic uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) (Buntine and Weigend 1991; Denker and Lecun 1991; MacKay 1992; 1995; Neal 2012) are one approach to quantify uncertainty associated with model parameters. In a BNN, all model weights are represented as probability distributions over possible values, rather than fixed scalars. In this setting, the learned mapping of a BNN model must be robust under different samples of weights. We can easily quantify model uncertainties with BNNs by, for example, sampling weights and forward inputs through the network multiple times. This approach learns potentially better representations and predictions due to the ensemble nature of BNNs, as shown in (Blundell et al. 2015). It was also found to be beneficial for exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) problems, such as contextual bandits.\n\nAnother situation where uncertainty arises is when collected data is noisy, which is often the case when we rely on observations and measurements to obtain the data. Even when the observations and measurements are precise, noises might exist within the data generation process. Such uncertainties are referred to as data uncertainties in this paper and are also called aleatoric uncertainty (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen 2009). Depending on whether the uncertainty is input-independent, data uncertainty is further divided into homoscedastic uncertainty and heteroscedastic uncertainty. Homoscedastic uncertainty is the same across the input space and can be caused by systematic observation noise. On the other hand, heteroscedastic uncertainty is dependent on the input. For example, when predicting the sentiment of a Yelp review, a single-word review \"good\" might have 3, 4, or 5-star ratings, while a lengthened review with strong positive emotion phrases is likely to be a 5-star rating. In the rest of the paper, we also refer to heteroscedastic uncertainty as input-dependent data uncertainty.\n\nRecently, there have been an increasing number of studies investigating the effects of quantifying uncertainties in different applications (Kendall, Badrinarayanan, and Cipolla 2015; Gal and Ghahramani 2016b; Kendall and Gal 2017; Zhu and Laptev 2017). In this paper, we focus on exploring the benefits of quantifying both model and data uncertainties in the context of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, we study the effects of quantifying model uncertainty and input-dependent data uncertainty in sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling tasks. Our results show that there is a potential performance increase when including both uncertainties in the model. We also analyze the characteristics of the quantified uncertainties.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n1. We mathematically define model and data uncertainties via the law of total variance.\n2. We explore the benefits of quantifying both model and data uncertainties in NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling.\n3. We analyze the characteristics of the quantified uncertainties and show that there is a potential performance increase when including both uncertainties in the model.\n\nNote that I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and readability of the text, including:\n\n* Using a more formal tone and avoiding contractions\n* Reorganizing some of the sentences for better flow and coherence\n* Adding transition words and phrases to improve the connections between ideas\n* Changing some of the sentence structures to improve clarity and concision\n* Adding a few words to make the text more precise and accurate\n* Changing the formatting to make the text more readable"}}

For instance, LLMs have shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities, enabling them to generalize across various domains and adapt to new, unseen data by generating responses that are informed by the context in which they are deployed, which is particularly useful in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. A significant challenge in LLMs is their propensity to produce hallucinations, which are instances where the model generates information that sounds plausible but lacks factual basis due to its tendency to fill in gaps in its knowledge with fictional information, potentially leading to inaccuracies and misinformation. To mitigate this issue, researchers have employed various methods to ground statements in responses generated by LLMs in supported evidence. Specifically, these methods aim to ensure that the generated text is accurate and reliable by incorporating external knowledge sources and fact-checking mechanisms. However, existing works primarily focus on the retrieval stage (Ye et al., 2023b) and the evaluation process (Yue et al., 2023), with limited exploration of other aspects, such as the generation process and the adaptability of LLMs to new tasks and domains. Optimizing the generation process is crucial as it reduces hallucinations in the original answer, which can be achieved through various techniques such as data augmentation, knowledge distillation, and regularization. Fine-tuning LLMs after pre-training can also significantly improve performance for users' downstream tasks by adapting the model to specific tasks and domains using various fine-tuning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and supervised fine-tuning, which leverage the pre-trained knowledge and adapt it to the task at hand. One such method is supervised fine-tuning, which involves training the model using standard likelihood-based training and positive examples of correct behavior to refine its performance, and has been shown to be effective in various applications such as language translation, question answering, and text classification. However, these methods often suffer from expensive data collection processes, which can be time-consuming and require significant resources, highlighting the need for more efficient and cost-effective approaches to fine-tuning LLMs."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 48.968788146972656, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.606459617614746, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's a polished version of the text:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent abilities and have gained widespread application in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022; Anil et al., 2023). One of their notable capabilities is in-context learning, which has been observed across a variety of domains and tasks (Dong et al., 2023). However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has also highlighted a significant issue: they often produce hallucinations in certain situations (Ye et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023). This phenomenon, where LLMs generate information that sounds plausible but is nonfactual, limits their applicability in the real world. To mitigate this issue, researchers have resorted to grounding statements in responses generated by LLMs to supported evidence, either by providing rationales or by adding citations to the statements (Li et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). Recent works have utilized external knowledge sources, such as retrieved documents and knowledge graphs, for attribution (Shuster et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023c).\n\nThese works can be broadly categorized into two types: (1) the model generates an answer with citations based on the retrieved documents (Li et al., 2023b), and (2) an answer is first generated, then modified again to add attribution references by retrieving with query and initial answer (Gao et al., 2023a). However, these approaches primarily focus on the retrieval stage (Ye et al., 2023b) and the evaluation process (Yue et al., 2023). Considering the vast knowledge and capabilities of LLMs, it is more essential to optimize the generation process, not only reducing the hallucination of the original answer but also avoiding the hallucination of the attribution process.\n\nFine-tuning LLMs after pre-training can also significantly improve performance for users' downstream tasks. Standard likelihood-based training can be performed using positive examples of correct behavior (Brown et al., 2020). Alternatively, methods such as unlikelihood training on negative examples (Welleck et al., 2020) or RLHF-PPO (Ziegler et al., 2019) can be used for learning, given positive and negative examples. However, these methods usually suffer from expensive data collection processes, reward model training, sparse reward, and text degeneration problems, making them difficult to use in practical applications (Azar et al., 2023).\n\nIn this paper, inspired by the citation mechanisms in human scholarly writing (Brooks, 1986; Teplitskiy et al., 2022), we address these challenges by conceptualizing the attribution task for LLMs as preference learning and proposing an Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework, as shown in Figure 1. Initially, we assemble a curated dataset comprising 6,330 examples sourced and refined from existing datasets for post-training. This step familiarizes LLMs with the basic format and requirements of attribution. Considering the substantial cost and time-consuming nature of preference pair annotations, we introduce an automated approach to generate attribution preference data, yielding 95,263 pairs.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the human process of citation and direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023), we propose a progressive preference optimization method with experience replay, bypassing the need for explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5) and demonstrate that APO surpasses compared baselines across all datasets with improved citation F1 and higher response quality.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n*   We are the first to apply preference learning for attribution tasks and show that our method can be applied under synthesized preference scenarios.\n*   We establish a full data collection pipeline for attribution tasks and will open-source our authorized data after publication for future research.\n*   We propose a progressive preference optimization method to alleviate the sparse reward problem by leveraging fine-grained information and benchmark existing direct preference optimization methods for attribution tasks.\n\nChanges made:\n\n*   Improved sentence structure and grammar for clarity and coherence.\n*   Added transitions to connect ideas between paragraphs.\n*   Removed redundant words and phrases.\n*   Standardized formatting and citations.\n*   Provided more detailed explanations for complex concepts.\n*   Added a summary of the paper's contributions.\n*   Made minor adjustments to sentence length and complexity for better readability."}}

Ask your doctor about any questions you may have, such as the best ways to quit, the benefits and risks of different treatment options, and how your drinking habits affect your health. Inpatient alcohol detox occurs in a rehab facility, where doctors and staff are available 24/7 to help you through your recovery, providing constant support and guidance. Inpatient detox can take anywhere from 5-14 days and is most suitable for people with severe alcoholism and withdrawal symptoms, such as delirium tremens, which require close monitoring and care. You can recover in a calming facility, escaping the pressures of daily life and focusing on your health and well-being. Some people can detox well in a facility but struggle when they return home, making it essential to have a solid support system in place. Having the support of family and friends can make this transition a little easier and provide a sense of belonging and encouragement. Inpatient detox can be quite expensive, so ask your insurance if they offer coverage, or inquire at the center to see if there's a payment plan that allows you to pay the fee over a few months. You must see a doctor before heading to an inpatient detox facility, who will determine whether it's the right course of action for your recovery and provide personalized guidance. Outpatient detox treatment requires daily visits to a detox clinic for several days to two weeks, where professionals will closely supervise your medications and recovery progress. You won't have to stay overnight at the facility, but your care will still be closely monitored by the professionals there, providing a balance between freedom and support. Outpatient detox offers the benefit of being able to live at home and have more freedom, as well as being less expensive than inpatient detox, but it also makes it easier to relapse and start drinking again. However, this is particularly challenging if you have a difficult home life or if another family member is an alcoholic, making it essential to have a strong support system. Outpatient detox is only suitable for those with mild to moderate symptoms of alcoholism, who haven't been drinking heavily or for a very long time, and requires careful consideration and evaluation. You must see a doctor before heading to an outpatient detox facility, who will determine whether it's the right course of action for your recovery and provide personalized guidance. If you're chemically dependent on alcohol, quitting or cutting back can be very challenging, but fortunately, there are medications available that can make the process easier. Fortunately, there are medications available that can make the process of quitting or cutting back on alcohol easier, such as Disulfiram (Antabuse), Naltrexone (Revia), and Acamprosate (Campral). Disulfiram (Antabuse) discourages drinking by interacting with alcohol to produce unpleasant physical reactions like nausea and headaches, but it can also be addictive and requires close doctor supervision. However, Disulfiram (Antabuse) can also be addictive and should only be taken with very close doctor supervision, making it essential to carefully weigh the benefits and risks. Naltrexone (Revia) prevents you from feeling the pleasant \"buzz\" that alcohol normally produces and also comes in an injected version called Vivitrol, which provides a longer-lasting effect. Naltrexone also comes in an injected version called Vivitrol, which provides a longer-lasting effect and can be administered by a healthcare professional. Acamprosate (Campral) reduces alcohol cravings, helping you to stay on track with your recovery goals. Delirium tremens are similar to alcohol withdrawal shakes, but they affect your whole body and are much more severe, making it essential to seek medical attention immediately. If you experience severe whole-body tremors after you stop drinking, along with other symptoms such as hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, and seizures, seek medical attention immediately and undergo diagnostic testing, such as blood work, to determine the underlying cause. You may need blood drawn to see if liver damage is to blame, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. If you find yourself in the position of dealing with someone else experiencing delirium, it can be difficult to know what to do, so it's essential to educate yourself on how to care for someone with delirium. Read up on how to care for someone with delirium, including providing a safe and supportive environment, managing symptoms, and seeking medical attention when necessary. Cirrhosis of the liver occurs when scar tissue builds up on the liver and makes it difficult for it to function, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Severe cirrhosis is life-threatening, but when caught in the early stages, liver damage can be treated and limited, though not cured, making it essential to seek medical attention right away. If you notice any symptoms, such as fatigue, easy bleeding and bruising, yellow discoloration in your skin and eyes, spidery blood vessels, swelling in your legs, or redness on your palms, see a doctor right away to undergo diagnostic testing and develop a treatment plan. Behavioral therapy, or addiction counseling, can help you develop healthy coping strategies and attainable goals as you work toward quitting or cutting back your alcohol use. This type of therapy can also help you uncover and work through underlying issues that may be contributing to your drinking habits, which can be a powerful tool in your recovery journey. Ask your doctor to recommend a therapist who specializes in addiction or substance abuse, who can provide personalized guidance and support. Getting support from others who understand what you are going through is an important component of dealing with alcohol dependency, providing a sense of belonging and encouragement. People in your support group can provide sympathy and friendship, as well as help hold you accountable or offer assistance if you find yourself in crisis or struggling with setbacks. Ask your doctor to recommend group therapy or peer-led support groups in your area, which can provide a sense of community and support. Do some research to see what groups are available, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, which can provide a structured and supportive environment for recovery. Your family and friends can play a key role in helping you successfully recover from alcohol abuse by providing emotional support and encouragement.

These approaches are generative in nature, aiming to estimate a probabilistic model of the document generation process through a framework that captures the underlying dynamics of document creation. Generative document models, such as simple unigram mixture models, incorporate information from both the background collection and a specific document, enabling more accurate predictions and improving information retrieval systems. The primary challenge in document language modelling lies in parameter estimation, which has led to the development of various smoothing approaches that aim to better estimate the parameters of the document models given a collection of documents. In information retrieval, documents can be ranked by the likelihood of their document model generating the query, also known as the query-likelihood approach, which provides a more accurate ranking system by matching documents with the user's search query. Recently, document language models that exhibit a self-reinforcing property, via a multivariate P\u00f3lya process, have been shown to significantly increase retrieval effectiveness, offering a more nuanced understanding of word frequency patterns. This approach captures word burstiness in a document-specific way, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of word frequency patterns and enabling the development of more accurate information retrieval systems. In this paper, we take this approach further and outline a general process for statistical document modelling, one that encompasses a number of existing document language models as well as a number of novel variants, providing a more comprehensive framework for information retrieval. Our approach outlines a general model of document generation in terms of an urn scheme, which models the dynamics of document generation using a matrix M, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the document generation process.

Let u0 be an initial state of the urn, containing |u0| balls in total, where each ball represents a distinct word-type, and v denotes the number of distinct word-types. Starting at time i = 0, a ball is drawn with replacement from the urn, and a number of additional balls (possibly of different word-types) are added to the urn according to a replacement matrix M, defining the process's dynamics and shaping the word distribution. Each row of this matrix determines the number of additional word-types of each colour to add to the urn and is selected according to the word-type of the ball drawn from the urn. Now, if d = {ti} is a sequence of observations indexed from i = 0 to i = |d| - 1 drawn from the urn, then the state of the urn can be described as a recurrent process as follows: ui+1 = ui + eti \u00b7 M, where eti is a standard basis vector, and M is the replacement matrix. At a particular time i and for an observation ti, the process essentially selects row ti of the matrix M and combines it with the ith state of the urn ui, imbuing the urn with a reinforcing property that enables the development of more accurate information retrieval systems. This property results in the traditional P\u00f3lya urn scheme in specific cases, offering insights into the process's behaviour and enabling the development of more accurate information retrieval systems. The generalised P\u00f3lya process is thus defined by both the replacement matrix M and the initial parameters u0, and the likelihood of seeing a specific sample d can be written as p(d|u0, M). One can interpret u0 as completely defining the probability of seeing a particular word-type on the first draw and can interpret M as defining the dynamics of the urn, shaping the process's behaviour and enabling the development of more accurate information retrieval systems.

This approach captures word burstiness in a document-specific way. \n\nIn this paper, we take this approach further and outline a more general process for statistical document modeling, encompassing existing document language models and novel variants. Our general model of document generation is based on an urn scheme, which models the dynamics of document generation using a matrix M. This matrix is critical in determining the generative distribution of the model.\n\nIn Section 2, we outline the general model of document generation in terms of an urn scheme, which uses the matrix M to capture the dynamics of document generation.

Section 5 describes our experimental setup. The results of a number of experiments are reported in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude with a discussion and outline some future work.\n\n2 Generalized Polya Process\n\nLet $u_0$ be an urn initially containing $|u_0|$ balls in total, where each ball represents one of $v$ distinct colours. Starting at time $i = 0$, a ball is drawn with replacement from the urn, and a number of additional balls (possibly of different colours) are added to the urn according to a replacement matrix M. Each row of this matrix determines the number of additional balls of each colour to add to the urn, and the row is selected according to the colour of the ball drawn from the urn. The dynamical nature of this random process is defined by the $v \\times v$ matrix M. \n\nIf $d = \\{t_i\\}$ is a sequence of observations indexed from $i = 0$ to $i = |d| - 1$ drawn from the urn, then the state of the urn can be described as a recurrent process as follows:\n\n$$u_{i+1} = u_i + e_{t_i} \\cdot M$$\n\nwhere $e_{t_i}$ is a standard basis vector (a.k.a. a one-hot vector). At a particular time $i$ and for an observation $t_i$, the process selects row $t_i$ of the matrix M and combines it with the $i$th state of the urn $u_i$. This imbues the urn with a reinforcing property, and in specific cases, results in the traditional Polya urn scheme. The generalized Polya process is thus defined by both the replacement matrix M and the initial parameters $u_0$. The likelihood of seeing a specific sample $d$ can be written as $p(d | u_0, M)$. \n\nOne can interpret $u_0$ as completely defining the probability of seeing a particular coloured ball on the first draw, and interpret M as defining the dynamics of the urn. These types of models are well-suited to modeling natural language, where different coloured balls represent different word-types [7], and the number of balls of each colour in the urn is proportional to the probability of generating a specific word.\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Improved sentence structure and grammar for clarity and readability\n- Added headings and section breaks to improve organization and flow\n- Corrected typos and formatting errors\n- Improved mathematical notation and formatting for better readability\n- Clarified and simplified some technical explanations\n- Added minor revisions to improve sentence flow and grammar."}}

The GPT series models represent cutting-edge language models that have achieved impressive strides in natural language processing, exhibiting capabilities that were previously unimaginable due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within language. Scholars have observed that as the parameter count of GPT language models increases, their natural language understanding capabilities become correspondingly more powerful, leading to a surge in the quality of generated content as a result of the models' ability to learn from and generalize across vast amounts of data. Notably, GPT-3 boasts 170 billion parameters, a staggering number that underscores the significance of its design in enhancing natural language understanding capabilities, a crucial aspect of modern AI systems, where the ability to comprehend and respond to human language is critical.

The natural language understanding capability is a critical factor limiting the effectiveness of question-answering systems, a significant challenge that must be addressed to improve the overall performance of these systems, which are designed to provide accurate and informative responses to user queries. Question-answering systems face significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where linguistic diversity often leads to questions and answers mismatching problems, a common issue that affects the accuracy of these systems, which struggle to adapt to the vast and ever-changing landscape of human language. In such scenarios, the training set typically cannot encompass all possible user question inputs, leading to issues with question-answering system performance, a significant limitation that must be addressed through the development of more robust and adaptable systems.

Causal discovery methods, which are crucial in this process, estimate causal structures from observational data and generate causal graphs to visualize causal relationships between observed variables, enabling researchers to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through other means. A causal graph is a directed diagram that visualizes causal relationships between observed variables, with each node representing a variable and each edge representing a causal relationship, which is essential for understanding the underlying structure of causal relationships and facilitating the identification of potential interventions. However, verifying the causal graph estimated by causal discovery methods can be challenging, particularly when the methods are unsupervised, as it requires experts to manually verify the validity of the graph, often by conducting controlled experiments, which can be time-consuming and costly due to varying ethical concerns across fields. To address this challenge, experts must manually verify the validity of causal graphs, which can be expensive and infeasible due to varying ethical concerns across fields, because conducting controlled experiments is often required, and this process can be further complicated by the need to consider the potential consequences of their findings. In an example of a causal graph, such as the \"L C, v96.02\" graph, the relationships between variables are visualized, and this visual representation can be a helpful tool for understanding the underlying relationships and facilitating the identification of potential patterns and trends. Work on this topic was conducted during an internship at Fujitsu Limited by Nina Holsmoelle, where she likely encountered various challenges in verifying causal graphs and gained valuable experience in applying causal discovery methods to real-world problems. Another approach to verifying a causal graph is to utilize external knowledge from text sources, which can assist human experts in verifying its validity, but verifying a causal graph with a large number of variables becomes increasingly difficult due to the rapid growth of text sources, which can lead to information overload and decreased accuracy. To address this challenge, natural language processing technologies, such as large language models, can be used to verify causal graphs by predicting causal relations between node pairs based on the textual context and assist human experts in this task, which can potentially reduce the time and cost required for manual verification and improve the accuracy of the results.

Being kind, approachable, and willing to provide feedback will help students feel supported and valued. Providing constructive feedback on written assignments and in-class responses will show that you're invested in their individual growth and success.\n\nFinally, acknowledging your students' efforts and appreciation on the last day of class can make a lasting impression. Bringing a special treat or writing a heartfelt note will show that you value their presence in your classroom and have enjoyed their company. This positive ending will leave a lasting impression and reinforce your reputation as a caring and effective classroom leader."}}

Tilt the clinometer until you can see the top of a tall object through the straw or paper tube. You can use this method to measure the angle between you and the top of the object or the object's height. Keep the clinometer steady in that position until the string becomes still. To find the angle, subtract the string's position on the protractor from the midpoint (90\u00ba). For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is 90 - 60 = 30\u00ba. If the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150 - 90 = 60\u00ba. The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba, and the answer will always be positive. If you subtract the larger number from the smaller and get a negative number, simply remove the minus sign to get the correct answer. For example, if you calculate that 60 - 90 = -30\u00ba, the actual angle of elevation is +30\u00ba. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the triangle formed by the three points is you, the base of the object, and the top of the object. The opposite side from this angle is the height of the object, and the adjacent side is the distance between you and the object's base. You can use a calculator, online tool, or chart to find the tangent of the angle. To calculate the tangent on a calculator, press TAN and enter the angle you found. If the answer is below 0 or above 1, set your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again. To find the object's height, you'll also need to know the distance between you and its base. Measure this distance using a tape measure. If you don't have one, count the number of steps it takes to get to the object and then measure the length of one step. The total distance is the number of steps multiplied by the length of one step. Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge, which can help with calculations. Remember that the tangent of your angle is the object's height divided by the distance between you and the object. Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll find the object's height. For example, if the angle of elevation was 35\u00ba and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 times the tangent of 35\u00ba, or 31.5 units.

When the water level is too high, water constantly drains into the overflow tube. Resolve this problem as soon as possible to prevent water from spilling out onto the floor and causing major water damage if the toilet becomes clogged. \n\nTo diagnose the issue, with the water running and the tank full, inspect the overflow tube. This is the open tube in the middle of the tank that connects the tank and the toilet bowl. Check if water is continuously draining into the tube. If that's happening, you can adjust the water level by lowering the float. \n\nThe fill valve, which brings water into the toilet tank, has a float on it that rises or lowers with the water level. The float height tells the fill valve to shut off when the tank is full. To lower the water level in the tank, you can adjust the height of the float. There are two main types of floats:\n\nA float ball fill valve features a long arm attached to the fill valve, with a rubber ball-shaped float at the end. Shake the float ball to determine if there's water inside it. If so, replace it. A float cup fill valve has a small circular cylinder wrapped around the body of the fill valve. The cylinder, or float cup, slides up and down on the fill valve shaft, and its height determines the water level.\n\nTo adjust the float on both types of valves, locate the screw attaching the float arm to the fill valve. Use a screwdriver to turn the screw a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float. \n\nFlush the toilet and let the water in the tank refill. Check the water level. Ideally, the water level should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8\u00a0cm) below the top of the overflow tube. Continue adjusting the screw by quarter turns until the water level is right. The process is similar for adjusting the float on a float cup fill valve. Locate the adjustment screw on top of the fill valve and turn it a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float. \n\nFlush and refill the toilet tank, then check the water level. Make another quarter-turn adjustment if necessary until the water level in the tank is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8\u00a0cm) below the top of the overflow tube.\n\nAdditionally, ensure the refill tube is always above the water line to prevent intermittent running.

There are a few different lengths commonly available, but the best options for making a mixtape are 60 minutes (30 minutes on each side) or 90 minutes (45 minutes on each side). It's best to avoid 120-minute cassettes, as their sound quality is significantly lower.\n\nOrganizing Your Music Collection\n--------------------------------\n\nTo make a mixtape, you'll need to organize your music collection. Start by stacking your recorded music so that you can work your way through the stack from top to bottom. This will help you keep track of your project and avoid losing your place.\n\nIf possible, label each track with its length. This will help you plan your mixtape and ensure that you can fit all the songs you want to include. Additionally, if you're using a mixtape with two sides, labelling the track lengths will help you plan for the break that comes halfway through the tape.\n\nWorking with Digital Music Collections\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf your music collection is primarily digital, don't worry \u2013 you can still make a cassette mixtape. To do this, burn the songs you want to use onto blank CDs using your computer's optical recording drive. Then, record the songs onto the tape from the CDs.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a way to run your MP3 player's audio through your stereo, you can record directly from it onto the tape. However, be aware that sound quality may be compromised if you use this method compared to recording from a CD.\n\nUsing an Integrated Setup\n---------------------------\n\nIf you have a stereo or hi-fi system with a built-in cassette recorder, consider using it. Most systems manufactured over the last few decades have this feature. Look for the tape deck with an extra button, usually marked with a red dot. Let the tape play for a few seconds until the sound changes to a smooth hiss, and then stop it.\n\nRecording from Your Music Collection\n----------------------------------------\n\nTo start recording, put the first album you're copying a song from into the appropriate player on the stereo or hi-fi. For CDs, pause the playback and skip tracks until you reach the track you want. For other cassettes, fast-forward to the song, and then stop or pause the tape. For LPs, leave the dust cover up and wait for a moment.\n\nNext, push the \"record\" button on the recorder deck. This will automatically start the recording process and ensure that none of the song gets clipped off at the start. If you're recording from an LP, drop the needle just before the song you want to record, and once the record reaches the silent space between tracks, push \"record\" on the tape deck.\n\nStopping the Recording\n----------------------\n\nAs soon as your song is finished, push the \"stop\" button on the recorded deck. This will stop the recording process. You can then stop the first album and switch it out for the next song on your mixtape list.\n\nCompleting Your Mixtape\n-------------------------\n\nWhen your cassette reaches the end of the first side, it's time to flip it over and continue on the back. Listen to your mixtape through to make sure everything recorded correctly. If a song didn't come out right, record over that part of the tape until you're satisfied.\n\nAdding Finishing Touches\n-------------------------\n\nFinally, consider adding cover art, decorations, or other finishing touches to make your mixtape truly special."}}

However, meaningful change doesn't happen overnight; it takes time and effort. Changing even a single bad habit can be a significant challenge, but it's a crucial first step towards making progress by acknowledging the areas that need improvement and taking responsibility for your actions. It's perfectly fine to take baby steps towards making meaningful changes in your life by becoming aware of your habits and taking action to change them. The first step towards real change is becoming aware of where your problems lie and acknowledging the areas that need improvement, being honest with yourself and shining a light on your habits. Simply being aware of your habits isn't enough; you must take action to change them, and to build confidence in your self-improvement project, start small and focus on making progress in one area at a time by working towards tangible results. Work in one area until you've seen significant improvement, then move on to a new area, as you make positive changes in one area, you may find that they have a ripple effect and improve other areas of your life. To fix your life, take a closer look at the factors that are holding you back and contributing to your current situation. Recognizing this gives you the power to make changes and improve your life. Think about the behaviors you repeatedly engage in that leave you feeling dissatisfied with life, including negative thought patterns, such as self-defeating talk. Self-defeating talk often manifests as saying things like 'I can't' or 'I'm not good enough.' Ruminating negatively about the past involves dwelling on past events. Assuming the worst means looking at life through a negative lens or expecting the worst in every situation. Comparing yourself critically to others can lead you to view others as better, more attractive, or wealthier than you. Playing the victim means viewing yourself as weak or incapable of dealing with challenges. Struggling to forgive yourself involves dwelling in guilt over past mistakes. Blaming means attributing your misfortunes to others rather than taking responsibility for your actions. Fearing failure or mistakes can lead to perfectionism and an inability to take risks. If your life is currently undesirable, you may need to reassess your relationships by distancing yourself from those that drain you or contribute to unhealthy habits, and create space to form more positive connections, as ideally you want to surround yourself with people who are positive, supportive, and uplifting, as such relationships are crucial for happiness and well-being; however, if your relationships consistently drain you, demotivate you, or contribute to unhealthy habits, it's likely time to re-evaluate them and take action as an adult to make positive changes and prioritize your own well-being."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 16.94758415222168, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.501999378204346, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's a revised version of the text, made more fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct:\n\nMaking significant changes in your life can be a daunting task. It's essential to understand that meaningful change doesn't happen overnight. Even addressing a single bad habit can be a challenging and time-consuming process. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that taking small steps towards improvement is not only acceptable but also expected.\n\nThe first step towards creating lasting change is awareness \u2013 understanding where your problems lie. Being honest with yourself and acknowledging your habits is a crucial step in fixing these issues. To build confidence in your self-improvement project, start small and focus on one area at a time. Work exclusively on this area until you see noticeable improvement, and then gradually move on to another area. You may find that the positive changes you make in one area of your life trickle down into other areas without you even trying.\n\nTo break free from a rut, you need to identify the factors contributing to your stagnation. It's often difficult to acknowledge that we are the ones standing in the way of our happiness, but recognizing this gives you the power to make changes. Take a closer look at the behaviors that repeatedly leave you feeling dissatisfied with your life. Research has shown that people who are chronically unhappy often share similar habits, including:\n\n- Playing the victim\n- Using substances or other addictive behaviors to cope\n- Feeling powerless to change their emotional state\n- Neglecting their health\n- Having rocky relationships\n\nIt's common to experience negative thoughts from time to time, but if your life is constantly disappointing you, your thought patterns might be to blame. The thoughts that run through your head on a daily basis have the power to either empower or cripple you. Here are eight negative thought patterns commonly found in chronically unhappy people:\n\n- Self-defeating talk: Engaging in negative self-talk, such as \"I can't...\" or \"I'm not good enough...\"\n- Ruminating negatively about the past: Dwelling on past events, especially those that were stressful or traumatic\n- Assuming the worst: Presuming the negative in all situations or viewing life through a \"glass half empty\" lens\n- Comparing yourself critically to others: Viewing others as more attractive, wealthier, or having better lives\n- Playing the victim: Choosing to see yourself as weak or incapable of dealing with challenging people or situations\n- Struggling to forgive yourself: Dwelling on guilt over past mistakes\n- Blaming: Attributing your misfortunes to others\n- Fearing failure or mistakes: Setting unreasonably high standards and being perfectionistic\n\nIf your life is undesirable right now, it may be time to assess your social circle. Ideally, you want to surround yourself with people who are positive, uplifting, and who see your value as a person. Such relationships are essential to happiness. However, if your relationships drain you, de-motivate you, or contribute to maintaining unhealthy habits, it may be time to re-evaluate them. As an adult, you must take responsibility for your role in any toxic relationships. Remember that you alone have the power to break free. If you choose to remain in such a relationship, acknowledge that you're doing so at the expense of your own well-being."}}

Always check the packaging for the correct serving sizes, as the amount of food can vary significantly depending on these factors. A consistent diet is essential for maintaining your dog's digestive health. If you decide to change your dog's food, introduce the new kind gradually by mixing it with the old food to prevent digestive upset.\n\n**Feeding Schedule and Portion Control**\n\nProper feeding is just as crucial as the type of food you feed your dog. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, increasing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. To prevent this, establish a regular feeding schedule, ideally once or twice a day, to provide your dog with a sense of routine. Monitor your dog's treats and adjust their normal food intake accordingly. If you give your dog a bone, reduce the amount of kibble they receive for dinner.\n\n**Hydration and Water Quality**\n\nHydration is critical for your dog's nutrition, digestion, and joint health. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh, clean water, even at night. When traveling or on outings, bring water for your dog. Regularly clean your dog's food bowl and water dish to prevent the buildup of mold, dirt, and bacteria.\n\n**Oral Hygiene and Dental Care**\n\nRegularly brushing your dog's teeth and using canine dental products, such as hard biscuits and dental chews, can help improve their oral hygiene. Choose toys that allow your dog to chew, like rope or nylon bones, to help keep their teeth clean and gums healthy. Brush your dog's teeth daily to prevent bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Use an angled brush specifically designed for dogs and canine toothpaste, as human toothpaste contains fluoride, which is poisonous to dogs.\n\n**Monitoring Food Intake and Preventing Obesity**\n\nIt's essential to monitor your dog's food intake and ensure they receive an appropriate amount for their size and ideal weight. While it may seem cruel to deny your dog food, letting them become obese is more cruel, as it compromises their health and well-being. If your dog is overweight, consult with your veterinarian to develop a diet plan to help them achieve a healthy weight.\n\n**Common Household Items That Are Toxic to Dogs**\n\nMany common household items are poisonous or lethal to dogs, including raisins, grapes, mushrooms, onions, macadamia nuts, caffeine, chocolate (especially dark chocolate and baking chocolate), alcoholic beverages, dairy products, and citrus fruits. Only administer medicines explicitly prescribed or approved by a veterinarian, as human drugs can be toxic to dogs.\n\n**Canine First Aid and Medical Care**\n\nAssemble a canine first aid kit with basic supplies, such as a pet first-aid book, self-cling bandages, gauze pads, antibacterial ointment or antiseptic wipes, disposable gloves, scissors, and tweezers. Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations can help prevent diseases like rabies and kennel cough, as well as parasites like fleas and heartworms.\n\n**Choosing a Veterinarian and Regular Check-Ups**\n\nWhen selecting a veterinarian, choose one nearby with good online reviews. Regular check-ups will help ensure your dog remains healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations and parasite control. The frequency of visits will depend on your dog's age and health. Puppies require multiple appointments in their first year, while adult dogs can usually receive annual check-ups, and senior dogs should visit their vet at least twice a year.\n\n**End-of-Life Care and Responsible Pet Ownership**\n\nWhen your dog is suffering from incurable illness or old age, seek your veterinarian's guidance to end their life humanely. Responsible pet owners control their pet's reproduction by neutering or spaying their dog as recommended by their veterinarian. Alternative options, such as Vasectomy, Neutering, Tubal Ligation, and Ovary-Sparing Spay (OSS), are available and may come with fewer long-term health risks than spaying and neutering."}}

The truth is, those who truly matter won't mind your choices, and those who do mind are probably not worth your time.\n\nFind your passion and pursue it with all your might. With a passion, you will be better equipped to tackle life's challenges. And if the world mocks you for it, then know that you're in the right place. You're at your best when you're happy, so don't let anyone dull your spark. Seek out your passions, no matter what others think, say, or do. Being selfish in a positive way is an art. It's the ability to discern what's best for you, while also considering the situation at hand. It's knowing when your desires are justified and when it's just about being content with your life.\n\nFor example, refusing to let your friend choose the movie you go to is being controlling and selfish. On the other hand, not attending her dance recital because you need to work another shift to pay the bills is being logical and responsible. Know the difference. This isn't just about your relationships with others; it's also about being true to yourself.\n\nThere will be times in your life when you should be selfish and times when you shouldn't. For instance, do you really want to move in with that guy you met online who lives on the coast of Australia, or should you take the opportunity to work with Habitat for Humanity and earn a scholarship for college? Sometimes what's best for you might not be what you want in the moment, but it will be what you want in the long run.\n\nIt's also essential to take time for yourself. Sometimes, all you need is a moment of solitude to recharge. Take a few minutes each day to do something that makes you happy, whether it's meditating, practicing yoga, or simply going for a walk. Even if you can't take a break, take 10 minutes at your desk to daydream. This downtime will give you the energy and focus you need to tackle your obligations.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of humility. We're often taught to downplay our achievements and attribute them to others. Don't do it. If someone offers you a compliment, accept it and be proud of yourself. You've earned it, and you deserve to feel good about your accomplishments.\n\nIt's also okay to say no to others when it's not in line with your goals or values. For example, if your friends are planning a night out, but you promised yourself you'd go to the gym, it's okay to decline their invitation. You have plans, and you shouldn't feel guilty about keeping them. Similarly, if you're a vegetarian and your friends are ordering pizza, speak up and tell them you want a veggie supreme. Your dietary restrictions are just as important as their desires.\n\nIn the end, it's about being true to yourself and living a life that's authentic to who you are. Don't let the world dictate what you should or shouldn't do. You have the power to make your own choices, and it's time to start using it."}}

Expanding the number of entity types can be beneficial, but it often requires labeling additional datasets. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has introduced a new era for open-type NER by enabling the identification of any type of entity using natural language instructions. This shift signifies a significant departure from the inflexibility of traditional models. However, powerful LLMs typically consist of billions of parameters and thus require substantial computing resources. Although some LLMs can be accessed via APIs (OpenAI, 2023), using them at scale can incur high costs.\n\nRecently, researchers have explored the fine-tuning of open-source language models, such as Figure 1: BiLM for Open NER, which aims to address the limitations of traditional models. Previous models, such as UniNER (Zhou et al., 2023) (Fig. a), approach the task of open-type NER by prompting LLMs with natural language instructions in a multi-turn dialogue style. Our proposed GLiNER model utilizes small bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs) and treats the NER task as a matching problem between entity types and textual spans in a latent space. LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023) has also been applied to named entity recognition tasks. Wang et al. (2023) introduced InstructUIE, a fine-tuned FlanT5-11B (Raffel et al., 2019; Chung et al., 2022) model on existing information extraction datasets, achieving excellent performance in zero-shot settings. Additionally, GoLLIE (Sainz et al., 2023) was introduced as an extension of InstructUIE work by fine-tuning a CodeLLaMa (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) using detailed annotation guidelines, resulting in significant performance improvements.\n\nAnother recent proposal by Zhou et al. (2023), called UniversalNER, involves the fine-tuning of LLMs using diverse data from various domains annotated with ChatGPT, rather than relying on standard NER human annotation. This approach enables the replication and even surpassing of the original capability of ChatGPT when evaluated in zero-shot on several NER datasets. However, these works present certain limitations that we seek to address: they use autoregressive language models, which can be slow due to token-by-token generation; they employ large models with several billion parameters, limiting their deployment in compute-limited scenarios; and they treat NER as a text generation problem, which requires several decoding steps and does not allow for parallel prediction of multiple entity types.\n\nIn our work, we propose a model that addresses these problems. Instead of relying on large autoregressive models, we utilize smaller-scale Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or deBERTa (He et al., 2021). The core concept of our model involves treating the task of Open NER as a matching problem between entity type embeddings and textual span representations in latent space, rather than as a generation task. This approach naturally solves the scalability issues of autoregressive models and allows for bidirectional context processing, which enables richer representations.\n\nWhen trained on the dataset released by (Zhou et al., 2023), which comprises texts from numerous domains and thousands of entity types, our model demonstrates impressive zero-shot performance. Specifically, it outperforms both ChatGPT and fine-tuned LLMs on zero-shot NER datasets (Table 1). Our model's robustness is further evident in its ability to handle languages not even encountered during training. Specifically, our model surpasses ChatGPT in 8 of 10 languages (Table 3) that were not included in its training data.\n\nHere are some additional suggestions to improve the text:\n\n1. Break up long sentences into shorter ones for better readability.\n2. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs.\n3.

On Monday, she underwent an MRI, which gave the doctors a much clearer picture of what was happening, revealing the extent of the cancer, and the results showed that the cancer was more advanced than initially thought. They called her in for a consultation on Friday, where I accompanied her to offer support, and we were initially greeted in the waiting room of a new hospital, where we were asked to fill out paperwork and wait to be called for the consultation. A nurse took some preliminary readings and then a doctor came in to discuss the situation with my mother, explaining their plan to address the cancer and reassuring her that they were there to help. I sat quietly in the corner, observing the scene and nodding in agreement as the doctors explained the situation and answered my mother's questions. The team was present, consisting of experts in radiation, chemotherapy, and recovery therapy, as well as those specializing in throat and neck diseases, who were all working together to develop a treatment plan and provide my mother with the best possible care. At this point, the room was crowded, and I was aware of my position off in the corner, observing the healthcare professionals as they worked together to develop a treatment plan for my mother. I was trying to stay out of the way and give the healthcare professionals enough space to work, allowing them to focus on my mother's care and make informed decisions about her treatment. They inserted a small camera into her nostril to examine her vocal cords, which were affected by the cancer, and assess her condition. As the camera was in place, the medical team asked her to perform breathing and vocal exercises, swallow water, and then applesauce, to assess her condition and gather more information about her symptoms. It was a bit difficult for me to watch as they examined her vocal cords and assessed her condition, but I tried to stay calm and support my mother throughout the process. After a few seconds, the healthcare professionals began explaining their findings and walking her through their plan, outlining the treatment options and reassuring her that they were there to help. Apparently, the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs and was growing rapidly, which explained the severity of her symptoms and the need for prompt treatment. The plan was to start with two weeks of radiation as soon as possible, followed by chemotherapy, to combat the cancer and help my mother feel better. The overall outlook was not promising, with the cancer having spread to multiple areas of her body, but the doctors assured us that they would do everything they could to help her. This wasn't the only information we received at that moment, but rather it was just the beginning of a long and difficult process that would unfold over the next few weeks. It was a moment of clarity, but it also brought a sobering realization about the severity of the situation and the challenges that lay ahead. The doctors explained their roles in the treatment process, introduced themselves, and then left, giving us time to process the information and ask any questions we may have had."}, "llama3": {"score": {"ppl": 26.09946060180664, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.134589672088623, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Here's an improved version of the text:\n\nThe event I'll be recounting took place just yesterday, although the unfolding of the situation spanned the entire week.

Their focus was on throat and neck diseases, and the room quickly became crowded. I moved to the periphery, trying to avoid drawing attention to myself.\n\nThe team then inserted a small camera into my mother's nostril to examine her vocal cords.

Fine-tuning Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) like BERT for specific downstream tasks has become an essential step in real-world implementations (Alt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, achieving significant performance gains in fine-tuning PLMs necessitates the availability of task-specific data for fine-tuning (Zhou and Chen, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Unfortunately, obtaining high-quality labeled datasets for this purpose poses significant challenges due to the expensive, complex, and labor-intensive nature of the annotation process (Yu et al., 2019; Bae et al., 2022).\n\nOne major challenge is the presence of noisy labels in large-scale datasets, often derived from web-crawling (Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) or crowd-sourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2021). Prior research has shown that PLMs are prone to overfitting and generally deliver subpar performance when fine-tuned on datasets containing label noise (Arpit et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021c; Wang et al., 2023a). The presence of noisy labels can mislead the training process and significantly impede the efficacy of PLMs (Zhu et al., 2022).\n\nTo address the problem of noisy labels, researchers have proposed various methods, such as separating clean samples from noisy ones in the training set for model training (Han et al., 2018) and pseudo-labeling noisy samples based on model predictions (Berthelot et al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2020). However, these methods are challenging to apply to PLMs, which tend to easily memorize noisy samples early on during the fine-tuning process due to their large size of parameters.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the problem, showing that PLMs exhibit similar prediction confidences for both clean and noisy samples. This results in two challenges when utilizing existing methods: (1) Existing approaches often rely on confidences generated by models trained on potentially noisy samples (Li et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2022), which can lead to inaccurate distinctions between clean and noisy samples. (2) Existing methods are susceptible to erroneous information during pseudo-labeling, as they directly utilize model predictions as pseudo-labels, which can be detrimental when the predictions are inaccurate.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LAFT, that harnesses the power of Large LAnguage Models (LLMs) for Fine-Tuning PLMs. We leverage LLMs trained on extensive corpora and fine-tuned with human instructions, such as GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023), to obtain external guidance in the form of confidence values. Our approach addresses the first challenge by utilizing LLM-generated confidences for each class of all training samples, which allows us to categorize them into three disjoint subsets: the Easy Clean (EC) Set, the Hard Clean (HC) Set, and the True Noisy (TN) Set.\n\nRegarding the second challenge, we propose a novel method to incorporate LLM-generated confidence scores as robust supervision information for all samples to ensure that PLMs learn useful information from them. As LLM-generated confidences are not affected by label noise, they can provide potentially relevant labels that are useful even if they are not entirely accurate.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\n* We are the first to explore the potential of leveraging supervision information (i.e., confidence scores) generated by LLMs to tackle the noisy label problem in fine-tuning PLMs.\n* We propose a novel framework LAFT that can effectively separate clean and noisy samples and learn from noisy labels, based on the LLM-generated confidences.\n* We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our framework in fine-tuning PLMs with noisy labels.\n\nChanges made:\n\n* Simplified sentence structures and wording\n* Improved coherence and flow of ideas\n* Corrected grammatical errors\n* Standardized formatting and punctuation\n* Added transition words and phrases to connect ideas\n* Clarified complex sentences and concepts\n* Removed unnecessary words and phrases\n* Improved clarity and concision of the text"}}

Don't wait for someone else to come and change your life - take charge and make things happen for yourself. Princess Zhao of Pingyang, a true heroine from ancient China, is an inspiring example of this. Born into a humble family, she rose to prominence by joining her father's army and even commanding her own troops. She proved that with determination and courage, anyone can achieve greatness, regardless of their birth or background.\n\nWe are all the same, with the same hopes and dreams, yet many of us are treated unfairly and denied their basic rights. You have the power to fight for those who are less fortunate. Be like Princess Lakshmibai, the brave Indian queen who defied the British Empire and led her people to freedom. She showed that even in the face of adversity, one person can make a difference and create change.\n\nDon't let anyone define what you can or cannot do. You are unique, and your passions and interests are what make you special. Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana of Thailand is a shining example of this. She is a skilled fashion designer and athlete, who refuses to be limited by traditional expectations of what it means to be a princess. You too can pursue your dreams and interests, no matter what others say.\n\nThe world needs people who are willing to challenge the status quo and fight for what is right. Princess Sikhanyiso Dlamini of Swaziland is a true feminist who refuses to be silenced by the outdated rules of her culture. She inspires others to be brave and speak out against injustice. You can make a difference in your own community by volunteering, fundraising, or simply lending a helping hand.\n\nYou don't have to be a princess to be a force for good. Princess Diana, the beloved mother of Prince William and Prince Harry, dedicated her life to making the world a better place. She worked tirelessly to help those in need, from AIDS patients to homeless people. Her compassion and kindness inspired millions, and she proved that even the smallest act of kindness can make a big difference.\n\nIn times of hardship, it's easy to lose hope, but it's precisely in those moments that we need to stay optimistic and keep working towards a better future. Queen Elizabeth, the current monarch of Britain, is a shining example of this. During World War II, she brought hope to a nation in crisis by speaking on the radio and supporting the war effort. We can all be like her, by speaking out against injustice and working towards a more equitable world.\n\nYou have the power to create change, no matter where you are in the world. Princess Ameera Al-Taweel of Saudi Arabia is a vocal advocate for women's rights, using her platform to promote equality and justice. She shows us that we all have a responsibility to use our voices and our actions to make the world a better place.\n\nNever be afraid to be smart, to learn and grow, and to challenge the norms. If someone doesn't like your brains, they're not worth your time. Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco is a brilliant example of this. She earned a degree in engineering and worked with computers before becoming a princess. Her intelligence and determination inspire us all to pursue our passions and never give up.\n\nIn conclusion, you have the power to shape your own destiny and make a difference in the world. Don't be afraid to be different, to speak out against injustice, and to pursue your dreams. You are a force for good, and your actions can change the world."}}
