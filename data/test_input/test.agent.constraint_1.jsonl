Keep the word 'that' unchanged:\n\nThere are virtually countless reasons why your Internet might not be performing as you expect it to, but a few common reasons include the following:  Old software or hardware Too many other computers or mobile items on the network Ongoing downloads Signal interference from walls or other appliances Low Internet speed from your Internet Service Provider . You pay for a certain amount of Mbps (megabits) per second of upload and download speed; checking your actual upload and download speed will give you an approximate idea of how close you are to the advertised speed.  Many Internet Service Providers advertise speeds of \"up to\" a certain number, meaning that the top speed itself isn't guaranteed. Most of the time, your computer's highest upload or download speed will be a little bit lower than the advertised speed. If the actual speed is close to the advertised speed, your ISP isn't the problem. Check your service plan to see what speed you are paying for, then compare that number with the actual speed that you found. If the speeds aren't anywhere close to each other, you'll need to call your ISP.  If you haven't upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to find faster internet for lower prices. Check all of the providers in your area. Don't fall for the megabit/megabyte trap. ISPs advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual transfer speed. If you are connected to the internet via a Wi-Fi router, you'll find that your Internet speed drops as you move further away from your router. Stay as close as possible to your router for maximum Internet speed. Make sure that your router and your computer have plenty of room all the way around to prevent overheating. If your router's signal has to travel through even one wall or appliance (e.g., a refrigerator), its signal will be weakened. A good rule of thumb is to have your router visible from where you're using your computer or mobile at all times. If your router is on a different floor than you, you may not even be able to receive a signal. Like a freeway, your Wi-Fi network can only handle a certain amount of traffic before it slows down. If possible, make sure that your computer is the only connection to your router; this will give you the best Internet results. It isn't always feasible to limit Internet access to one computer, but you can turn off and unplug things like smart TVs, extra computers, video game consoles, and anything else (e.g., an extra smartphone or tablet) that maintains an Internet connection even when turned off. instead of Wi-Fi. Most computers can plug directly into the back of the router using an Ethernet cable, which removes the lag time between the router's signal departing and your computer receiving the signal.  If you use a Mac computer, you'll most likely need an Ethernet to USB-C adapter if you want to plug your computer into the router. You cannot connect mobile platforms (e.g., smartphones and tablets) to Ethernet.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'that'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "that", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["detect_keyword(\"that\")", "word_count_check(2500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

The first color listed is your main house color, and the second color is your accent house color.  Gryffindor: Red and Gold Hufflepuff: Black and Yellow Ravenclaw: Blue and Bronze (books) or Blue and Silver (films) Slytherin: Green and Silver This design will create alternating thick and thin stripes. Your first stripe will be a thick one, using your main house color. The main house colors are listed below as such:  Gryffindor: Red Hufflepuff: yellow Ravenclaw: Blue Slytherin: Green You can use a stockinette stitch or a garter stitch. The stockinette stitch is alternating rows of knits and purls. It is knit on one side, and bumpy on the other. The garter stitch is knitting on each row. It will give you a bumpy texture on both sides. to the accent house color. Once you reach the end of the row, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Set the yarn aside, and pick up your accent color. The accent colors are as listed below:  Gryffindor: Gold Hufflepuff: Black Ravenclaw: Bronze (books) or Silver (films) Slytherin: Silver(films) Use the same stitch as you did for your main house color: stockinette or garter. Be sure to leave behind a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail when you start knitting. Once you reach the end of the second row, cut your accent color down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Pick up your accent color. Once again, leave a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail at the start of the first row and the end of the second one. This will create a distinctive double-stripe seen on the house scarves in the later films. Most scarves are about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Repeat the pattern listed below:  20 rows in your main color 2 rows in your accent color 2 rows in your main color 2 rows in your accent color Knit two stitches onto your right needle. Use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Slip that first stitch of off your right needle. Keep knitting a stitch, then using your knitting needle to pull the previous stitch off the needle. Stop when you have one stitch left. Once you reach the of the row and have one stitch left, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Thread it through the last stitch, then back through the loop. Make a tight knot, then use a yarn needle or a tapestry needle to weave the tail back into the scarf. Trim off any excess yarn. Go back over your scarf where you had the color changes. Tie the tail ends together, then weave them back into the body of the scarf. You can do this with a yarn needle or a tapestry needle. Trim off any excess yarn. Wrap some yarn around your palm three times. Cut the excess yarn off, then snip the bottom of the loop. Use a crochet hook to pull the folded part of all three strands through the bottom corner of your scarf. Pull the tail end of the strands through the loop. Tug on the tail ends to tighten them. This makes one tassel.  You can match the tassels to the stripe you are weaving them into. You can also use the other color. Consider alternating the tassels between your two house colors. Space the tassels about 2 stitches apart.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

Sign language processing (SLP) (Bragg et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2021) is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that is intertwined with computer vision (CV) and sign language linguistics. SLP spans the tasks of sign language recognition (Adaloglou et al., 2021), translation (De Coster main/examples/MMPT Figure 1: Illustration of SignCLIP, comprising a text encoder and a video encoder jointly trained on pairs of text and multilingual signing examples. Every sign is articulated in diverse languages and contexts with subtle differences in hand shape, movement, place of articulation, etc. The screenshots of the videos are from Spreadthesign and the matrix part is taken from CLIP. et al., 2023), and production (Rastgoo et al., 2021). Typical datasets, equipped with spoken language text and sign language glosses in addition to videos, that support SLP research are RWTH-PHOENIXWeather 2014T, in German Sign Language (DGS), introduced by Forster et al. (2014); Camgoz et al. (2018); and CSL-Daily, in Chinese Sign Language (CSL), introduced by Zhou et al. (2021). However, advances on a specific task/dataset/language are often limited and non-transferable to more generic and challenging settings (M\u00fcller et al., 2022, 2023) due to the small, domain-specific vocabulary (1,066 and 2,000 signs, respectively) and data size (11 and 23 hours, respectively). Recent sign language corpora of a thousand signing hours have emerged for relatively high-resource sign languages, e.g., BOBSL (Albanie et al., 2021) for British Sign Language (BSL) and YouTube-ASL (Uthus et al., 2024) for American Sign Language (ASL). In the meanwhile, outside the world of SLP, there is great progress in deep pretrained models of different modalities, GPT (Achiam et al., 2023) for text, \u2026house<American SL>house<British SL>house<Japanese SL>I painted my house gray.<American SL>I am a housewife.<lithuanian SL>\u2026SignCLIPVideoEncoderSignCLIPTextEncoder            \fmasked autoencoders (He et al., 2022) for images, and wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) for speech, to name a few. They are commonly pretrained on a huge amount of data (e.g., over 15 trillion tokens for Llama 3, Touvron et al. (2023)) with very little or weak supervision, but present striking multilingual and multi-task ability, for zero-shot prediction, fine-tuning, and representation learning. Ideally, the visual aspect of sign languages, i.e., larger lexical similarity due to iconicity (Johnston and Schembri, 2007) (illustrated in Figure 1) and smaller grammatical variation (Sandler and LilloMartin, 2006) than spoken languages, makes transferring between different sign languages easier than the text of different spoken languages or even scripts. The latter faces unfair tokenization issues (Petrov et al., 2024) and out-of-vocabulary errors. At the same time, unlike discrete text tokens (see the comparison in Table 1), the dense continuous video signal is expensive to process computationally and seems daunting for the above-mentioned self-supervised training approaches. Since SLP tasks and datasets usually involve both the text and visual/signed modalities, we take inspiration from OpenAI\u2019s CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021) but use contrastive learning to connect text with sign language videos instead of images. For video understanding, follow-up work such as VideoCLIP (Xu et al., 2021) mainly deals with tasks including action recognition (Zhu et al., 2020) and VideoQA (Xu et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018). However, both CLIP, VideoCLIP, and other existing multimodal models understand visual content on a coarse-grained level and generic domain and do not address the intricacy of sign language. We show the lack of sign language understanding in contemporary AI models both intuitively (Figure 3 in Appendix A) and empirically (Table 2). This work uses sign-language-specific data to train a CLIP-like model for SLP. We first validate the approach\u2019s feasibility on fingerspelling, a subsystem of sign language, by a model named FingerCLIP (\u00a74), which correctly understands the fingerspelling of individual letters. We then curate the Spreadthesign3 dictionary as a large-scale pretraining dataset consisting of \u223c500 hours of signing, as well as diverse public downstream task datasets to run comprehensive pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation on full-fledged sign languages.

Help them to read these whole stories by encouraging explicit phonics use, and recognizing vocabulary. As their word recognition increases, they\u2019ll be able to more fully understand story plots and meanings. Allow your child to look at the pictures - it doesn\u2019t count as cheating if they do. Image and word association is a helpful aspect of building vocabulary. After every reading session, have your child describe what the story was about to you. Try to get them to be detailed, but don\u2019t expect an elaborate response. An easy and fun way to help encourage this is to use puppets who represent characters in the story, so your child can describe it to you through them. Similar to when you were reading stories to your child, every time your child reads ask them questions about what they\u2019ve just read. At first it will be difficult for them to think critically about meanings of words and the buildup of character development and plot (or the semblance of those things in the most basic of stories), but over time they will develop the necessary skills to answer questions.  Make a questions list that your child can read; their ability to read and understand the provided questions is nearly as helpful as answering the questions themselves. Start with direct questions, such as \u2018who was the main character in the book?,\u2019 instead of more abstract questions like \u2018why was the main character upset?\u2019 Reading is a necessary precursor to writing, but as your child develops reading skills have them practice their writing in conjunction. Children learn to read faster and easier if they learn to write at the same time. The motor memory of the letters, listening to their sounds and seeing them in writing will reinforce new learning. So, teach your child to write letters and words. You\u2019ll notice an enhanced reading ability as your child learns to spell by decoding and sounding out words. Work slowly though, and don\u2019t expect perfection. Just as you taught your child the joy of reading before they knew how, you should continue to promote reading by reading to/with them on a daily basis. They\u2019ll develop a stronger phonemic awareness when they can see words as you read them, rather than struggling to do both at the same time themselves. You\u2019ll be given a better idea of your child\u2019s reading ability when they read out loud, and they\u2019ll be forced to slow down their reading to correctly sound out words. Avoid stopping your child to correct them while reading though, as doing so can interrupt their train of thought and make comprehending what they\u2019re reading more difficult. Reading out loud doesn\u2019t have to be limited to stories; whenever you are around words, have your child sound them out to you. Road signs are a great example of something your child sees on a daily basis, and can practice reading out loud to you.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

Each sentence should contain more than seven words:\n\nRolling your tongue into a tube is one of the most common tongue tricks. To do this, roll the outer edges of your tongue up and around so that edges of your tongue touch each other. Stick your tongue out of your lips to keep the tube shape.  To get the edges of your tongue to meet, push the edges upwards with your fingers from underneath. Make an \"O\" with your lips, and hold your tongue in the shape. Do this until you can roll your tongue without the aid of your fingers. Another way to make the shape with your tongue is to pull the middle of your tongue muscle down. This should pop the sides of your tongue upwards. Try to catch the edges of your tongue along the edges of the roof of your mouth. Then, push your tongue out between your lips while holding the shape. This is also called making a taco, a tongue roll, or a loop. 65-81% of people can roll their tongues; females are more likely to than males. Recent research has started to debunk the myth that tongue rolling is a genetic trait. Several studies in children showed that tongue rolling can be learned. For this trick, you are basically folding your tongue in half. Start by placing the tip of your tongue behind your teeth. Push forward with your tongue, keeping the tip of your tongue in place. It should fold in half. Open your mouth wider as you complete this. It helps you see how your tongue has been folded over. Turn your tongue over in your mouth. Either turn clockwise or counterclockwise, whichever is more comfortable for you. Press your tongue against your bottom teeth while using your top teeth to press the tongue flat. Poke the tip of your tongue out from your lips. You should see the bottom of your tongue. To help train your tongue to do this, use your fingers. Take your tongue and turn it over. Hold it there. Let it go, and try to work up to being able to hold your tongue there without any help. This trick might be difficult depending on the length of your tongue and the length of your nose. Start by sticking your tongue out. Point the tip of your tongue upwards. Stretch your tongue as far as you can towards your nose.  For some people, it might be helpful to pull your top lip over your teeth. For others, it might be helpful to stretch your top lip as close against your teeth as possible above the teeth near the gumline. This gets it out of the way so your tongue doesn't have as far to travel. Try flattening your tongue as you stretch it upwards. This might give you a better stretch than keeping your tongue pointed. As you work on stretching your tongue to touch your nose, use your finger to guide it towards your nose. This simple trick only requires you to make a depression with your tongue. Start with your tongue flat and your mouth open. Pull the middle of your tongue down while the edges curl upwards. Curl the tip of your tongue inwards. This should make a round edge to your tongue that looks like a spoon.  When you are finished with this trick, your tongue will be out of your mouth. The bottom of your tongue will be pressing against your bottom lip. If you are having trouble getting the round shape, try making a roll with your tongue at first. Then lift up your tip. Or try using your finger to make a depression in the middle of your tongue. This simple trick relies on lip placement. Cover both your lower and upper teeth with your lips. Press your tongue as flat against the roof of your mouth as possible. Make sure the edge of your tongue can be seen past your lips. The spaceship is made by the round edge of your tongue and the thin line of the skin below.  If you're struggling to get the right form, get your tongue into position against the roof of your mouth before moving your lips. Use your finger to help you push your tongue into position if you can't get it to press against the roof of your mouth.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

Each sentence contains more than 12 words:\n\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) developed significant interest in natural language processing (NLP) across academia and industry. LLMs are known for their language generation capabilities that are trained on billions or trillions of tokens with billions of trainable parameters. Recently researchers have been evaluating LLMs for various NLP downstream tasks, especially question answering (Akter et al., 2023; Tan et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023), reasoning (Suzgun et al., 2022; Miao et al., 2023), mathematics (Lu et al., 2023; Rane, 2023), machine translation (Xu et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2023), etc. Most of the existing works on the evaluation of LLMs are on resource-rich languages such as English. However, the capabilities and performances of LLMs for low-resource languages1 for many NLP downstream tasks are not widely evaluated, leaving a notable gap in the linguistic capabilities of low-resource languages. The most widely spoken yet low-resource languages of South Asia2 such as Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, several researchers are handling the scarcity of datasets and other resources in NLI (Aggarwal et al., 2022), Sentiment analysis (Hasan et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Koto et al., 2024) and Hate speech detection (Khan et al., 2021; Santosh and Aravind, 2019). However, the amount of work that uses LLMs is still very few, mainly due to a few constraints such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and research gaps associated with low-resource languages. These constraints of low-resource languages require more attention, alongside a focus on high-resource languages, to enhance the applicability of LLMs to general-purpose NLP applications. To fill the aforementioned gap, we comprehensively analyze zero-shot learning using various LLMs in English and low-resource languages. The performance of LLMs shows that GPT-4 provides comparatively better results than Llama 2 and Gemini. Moreover, the English language performs better on different tasks than low-resource languages such as Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu. The Key contributions are as follows: \u2022 To address the limitation of publicly available datasets for low-resource languages, we present datasets for sentiment and hate speech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, thereby facilitating research in lowresource language processing. 1Refers to the scarcity of datasets and other resources rather than limitations in LLM capabilities.             \f\u2022 We investigate and analyze the effectiveness of different LLMs across various tasks for both English and low-resource languages such as Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, which suggest that LLMs perform better when evaluated in English. \u2022 We apply zero-shot prompting using natural language instructions, which describe the task and expected output, enabling constructing a context to generate more appropriate output.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 12 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 12}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(12, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(12, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"more than\")"]}}}

Ensure the output contains fewer than 24 sentences:\n\nIf you want to respect yourself, then you should stop demeaning yourself, especially in front of others. It's one thing to laugh at yourself, but it's another thing to say things like, \"I look so fat today,\" or \"Why would anyone want to talk to me anyway?\" If you put yourself down, you are encouraging others to do the same. The next time you have a negative thought about yourself, write it down instead of saying it aloud. If you say it aloud, you'll be more likely to think it's really true. Try to focus on doing things that will make you proud of yourself, not just things that get cheap laughs or short-term attention. Stay away from regretful behavior, such as getting too drunk and acting sloppy in public, or hooking up with someone at a bar just for the attention. Try to maintain a consistent image of yourself. It will be hard for people to respect you as the smartest guy in class if you were dancing around with a lampshade on your head at a party the night before. It's okay to lose your cool from time to time, but if you're losing your cool too often and over little things, it will help your self-respect to deal with life's little stresses more efficiently. Try going for a walk to cool down, take deep breaths, and come back to the situation when you are calmer. Dealing with life's situations with a calm mind rather than when emotions are running high will help you feel more in control and better about the way you handle your daily situations, which in turn will help your self-respect. If you feel yourself getting angry, excuse yourself and go for a short walk, get some fresh air, or call someone who can help you feel grounded. You can also try meditation, writing in a journal, or talking it out with someone. . If you truly want to respect yourself, then you have to be able to know when you've made a mistake. If you've messed up, let people know in a way that shows that you're truly sorry and that you've put enough thought into the situation to avoid doing the same thing again in the future. Taking responsibility for what you do and doing your best to make amends for it will help you move past feeling bad about making the mistake, which will help your self-respect, because you will know and be proud of the fact that you did your best even though things didn't go as perfectly as you would have hoped. Give yourself and the people around you enough respect to be able to admit that you're only human. If you learn to admit that you're wrong, people will have much more respect for you and will be able to trust you more. Being around people who make you feel terrible about yourself is guaranteed to lower your self-respect, because you'll feel bad not only because of what that person says, but deep down, you'll also be mad at yourself for letting that person hang around you. Find people who make you feel positive, good about yourself and the world, and who actually take the time to listen to you and to help you sort out your feelings. This is especially true for relationships. It will be close to impossible to have true self-respect if you're dating someone who makes you feel worthless. . Some people think that bragging about their accomplishments will make people like them more. Doing this, however, will actually make you look insecure. If you really want people to respect you, practice modesty and humility, letting other people recognize for themselves how awesome you are.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"respect\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"respect\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"]}}}

Having a digital copy of your medical records will protect you in the event that your paper copies are damaged or lost \u2014 this is of particular concern for people who live in areas that have high risk of flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  Most printers have the ability to scan documents, so no other equipment is typically required. Once you scan the hard copies into your computer, create a \"Medical Records\" folder and then a few subfolders for each medical provider. Drop the scanned files into the applicable folders. As an alternative, you can input the data from your hard copies into your computer by hand (by typing), but that's a lot more time consuming then scanning them. If you have word processing software you're familiar with, that's great, but realize that there's also software specifically designed to organize your personal medical records. You'll still have to scan the physical documents, but the special software will do virtually all of the organizing for you.  The cost of new software typically ranges from $25 to $75, and may include some sort of online technical support as well. Search online for the software that best suits your budget and level of computer expertise. Some companies may offer free trials for limited periods of time. Regardless of how your files are organized on your computer, they should be backed up onto a physical CD, external hard drive or portable flash drive. Some healthcare providers, hospitals and insurance plans offer online records that you can access remotely. In other words, they place your medical records online (with your permission and on a secured database), so you can conveniently access them from your computer at home or even from your phone. If that's the case with your caregivers, then that might save you the time and hassle of scanning your hard copies.  You may need special apps and/or programs in order to access and navigate your online health records. Ask your primary caregiver (or their staff) for recommendations. If you're worried about security of your personal information online, you can request that your caregiver/medical facility not store any of your files online. Another electronic option is to store your personal health records on a secure third-party Internet site (or on the \"cloud\") once you've scanned the documents into your computer.

Ensure each sentence contains fewer than 24 tokens:\n\nIf you suspect that there are bees in your chimney, do not start your fireplace under any circumstance. Beeswax is highly flammable, and you may risk an explosion if you turn it on. Even if a major blast doesn\u2019t occur, the hot wax may eat through your grout and masonry, potentially causing extensive damage. On top of that, bees are good for the environment! You may be able to have them peacefully removed without killing any bees in the process. If you see dead insects in the pit of your fireplace or there are bugs flying around your chimney, see if you can confirm that they\u2019re bees. Bees always have fur, while wasps and hornets have smooth exteriors. In addition, hornets and wasps have longer, thinner thoraxes while bees tend to be round.  If you have hornets or wasps in your nest, call an exterminator and seal your chimney immediately. Hornets and wasps can be very aggressive towards humans, and if they think your home is their home, you could have a nasty situation on your hand. If you have an allergy to bees, do not get close to them. Bees are typically non-aggressive, but they may sting if they think you\u2019re trying to harm them. Rent an infrared camera from a construction supply store. Turn the camera on and point it at the fireplace. Slowly raise it up towards your roof while monitoring the screen. If there are lots of little dots flying around, you have bees. If there is a large, white mass on the screen, you have a hive.  An infrared camera will cost around $50-80 to rent for a day. If the bees haven\u2019t established a hive, it will cost considerably less to have the bees removed. The contractor will likely use a vacuum to extract the bees and take them elsewhere. This will usually cost anywhere from $50-200. If you have an established hive, it will cost a little more. The contractor will need to use a grinder to cut the hive out and remove it. This can cost $200-1,500, depending on the size of the hive and the chimney. Get an inflatable chimney plug from a construction supply store. Inflate the plug halfway by blowing into the tube. Then, slide it up the pit until it\u2019s at least 1\u00a0ft (30\u00a0cm) above the base of the chimney. Next, blow it up as much as you can to expand the plug and block the chimney. This is the best way to keep bees, wasps, or hornets from flying down into your home.  The damper, which is the hatch that closes the opening to the chimney, is not nearly enough to keep bees out. They can usually squeeze through the opening between the plates. Chimney plugs are also known as balloon plugs. Alternatively, hold a contractor\u2019s bag over the chimney and press long lengths of duct tape into the seam where the bag meets the masonry. Then, add more tape along the groves in the grout so it overlaps the seam where the first layer of tape meets the masonry. Do this 2-3 times to create an airtight fit.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 24 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"beeswax, \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bees\", 4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(9, \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")"]}}}

The seven manuscripts of the series cover the activity of the court during the years 1385, 1390-1392, 13971398, 1398-1399, 1400-1401, 141429, respectively, resulting in the delivery of approximately 3,000 criminal sentences1 discussed in the presence of the Milanese judges, pronounced by the podest\u00e02 and publicly recorded by the notaries who worked at the court in the Loggia degli Osii3. Although, as evident, the chronological span of each Liber varies considerably according to the length of time each podest\u00e0 was in office, the structure, the material aspect and even the form employed in the drafting of these manuscripts present elements of a certain homogeneity and uniformity. This is due to the fact that the notaries in charge of assisting mayors and judges during trials recorded the sentences according to a pattern that is repeated almost unchanged in all manuscripts. 1Throughout the article, the term \u201csentence\u201d will be used with its meaning of a punishment that a judge gives to someone who has committed a crime. 2A chief magistrate of a medieval Italian town. 3A historical building of Milan, from whose balcony sentences and edicts were proclaimed by the Milanese judges. Each verdict, preceded by the verbal invocation In nomine Domini, amen4 - is pronounced by the podest\u00e0 in accordance with the seigniorial decrees and statutes of the municipality of Milan. It contains the names of the accused, the narration of the legal proceeding, whether it was an inquisitio or an accusation, with the salient phases of the trial and the final pronouncement. In addition to the sentences, whose pattern is formally identical for all defendants, there are also numerous subsequent interventions: e.g. annotations relating to receipts for full or partial payment of penalties or cancellations of sentences. The Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani are pivotal sources for law historians, like all Medieval and Early Modern trial outcomes preserved in the European archives: they allow us to measure the distance between the discipline established by statuta and ius comune and its actual application before the courts of medieval cities (PadoaSchioppa, 2017). Indeed, the seven Libri photograph the complex balance of social and political forces that characterised the city of Milan during the Visconti rule (Gamberini, 2014). This documentary typology constitutes a source of great importance for historians of medieval law (Storti, 2021; Valsecchi, 2021; Bassani, 2021; Isotton, 2021; Bianchi Riva, 2021; Minnucci, 2021), meanwhile fulfilling the same function for medievalists tout court. It provides inspiration for those who deal with political and institutional history, since it allows one to investigate in practice the dynam4In the name of the Lord, amen. 22 r p A1 ] L C . s c [ v22.02 : v i X r a             \fics of the exercise and management of power, the men, the methods and timing through which justice is administered, including through the selection of judges (Pagnoni, 2021); at the same time, a collection of sentences issued by a city lord provides very useful elements for the study of society and economy, through the analysis and reconstruction of the type of crime, its scene and circumstances, the weapons used, the profiles of the people involved, including their reputation, qualification and profession. In this article, we present the LiMe dataset, an annotated Latin corpus consisting of 325 judicial documents from the first volume of the Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani. We illustrate the process undertaken for digitizing the documents and annotating them with detailed information, such as entities and relations, in order to make the  accessible and valuable to researchers.

Explore these options in depth realizing they may help you seize opportunities. Studies have shown that various forms of treatment you might encounter in therapy, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), are helpful in managing specific phobias like acrophobia. . There are numerous schools of psychotherapy, ranging from the traditional psychoanalytic method to existential and alternative approaches. The goal of any therapy program should be to help you safely and gradually lessen your fear while teaching you how to control your anxiety. Therapy may or may not be coupled with medicinal treatments. Ultimately, you must decide which type of therapy is the best option for you. But, there are things you should consider when choosing a therapist, including:  Accreditation. Before beginning a therapy program, look into the education and certification of those therapists and counselors you are considering. Try to find a therapist or counselor who is licensed in his or her field, and with some type of expertise in phobia/anxiety treatment. Experience. Try to find a therapist who has been in practice long enough to generate a number of happy, healthy former patients. If you can, talk to some. Ask them how effective and comfortable their experience was and whether they would recommend their therapist. Think twice about therapists who seem inexperienced or are unable to back up claims of success. Method of treatment. Most reputable therapists use modern, scientific techniques that have been subjected to peer review in legitimate medical publications. But, holistic and alternative methods have been researched and are widely effective for some people. Once you think you've found a suitable therapist, schedule a meeting and see if the therapist is a good fit. Different therapists may take different approaches to tackling your fear. But, nearly all will first ask you to describe your fear, asking questions about how long you've had it, any problems it's caused you, etc. Be completely honest with your therapist. The more information you can supply, the easier it will be to treat you. Also, be sure to communicate with your therapist as to what techniques do and do not seem to be working. You'll probably learn how to confront and control your anxiety. This doesn't try to remove your anxiety, but to make it more manageable. With a therapist, you'll learn to cope differently and begin to master your thoughts and feelings. Eventually, you'll learn to be more at peace with what you can and what you must learn to accept. One way that some (but not all) therapists approach phobias is to desensitize patients by gradually increasing their exposure to the stimuli that cause the fear, starting with relatively small experiences and slowly increasing sensation so that the patient develops a tolerance. For example, you might simply imagine standing at the edge of a cliff. Then, when this becomes manageable, you might look at a picture taken from a high vantage point. In recent years, virtual reality has offered therapists many exciting possibilities for safely letting patients overcome a fear of heights gradually in a controlled environment. Eventually, when the patient has made significant process, the patient may take a plane flight or some other act that initially would have caused great fear. Many therapists will assign take-home readings and exercises to reinforce mental and physical techniques you have been taught. You will be asked to challenge your own negative thought patterns and work on coping strategies on a day-to-day basis. Homework may include activities like breathing exercises, thought experiments, and more.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 29th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [29]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([28], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"fear\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"therapy\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Since I was 12 years old, I was in near constant pain from my menstrual cycle that no doctor was willing to diagnose properly or do any more than throw some ibuprofen in my face and walk away. It's the woman's burden (what are we in 17th century Europe?), or you'll grow out of it. Well, I am now in my 30's and if wasn't for chemotherapy to suppress my hormones, I wouldn't be able to walk or work. Thankfully, I met my savior shortly after turning 30. My mom passed away and I had a lot of feelings to work through; so I began seeing a delightful woman as my psychologist who recommended a doctor that she used and had sent many other women for treatment; even women who were scared of the obgyn. I wasn't scared, I just wanted someone to listen, someone to care and Dr. O**a turned out to be all of that and funny too. She truly cared and searched for reasons for my pain. After ultrasounds, MRIs, blood tests, exams, finally we found out what I'd said all along...I have crappy lady bits. :P Fibroids, PCOS, Adenomyosis, Endometriosis; you name it, my uterus probably had it. And I knew I just wanted it out; I never wanted to have children, and I said if I changed my mind, I'd adopt. But, I was young, so she tried other things, all while making sure to keep my pain in check. After multiple attempts at birth control and hemorrhaging twice, requiring blood transfusions and hospital stays; we finally agreed something more drastic had to be done. We started lupron and then waited. It blocked all of my sex hormones and prevented the pain. But, it's a form of chemo so I couldn't be on it forever. After a year of lupron, we shook on it, I would have my hysterectomy. It was scheduled right away, but she was unfortunately diagnosed with MS and couldn't operate. I had to wait some more. But the end was in sight. She introduced me to another surgeon in the practice and we scheduled the surgery. After three long months of waiting, it's finally here. I will finally remove the uterus that has ruined most of my adult life and kept me from enjoying most things would be tossed in the trash bin, where it belonged.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"]}}}

You could say, \"I'm bisexual, which to me means that I'm romantically attracted to people regardless of gender.\" Make it clear whether this will change your relationship or not. You could say, \"I want you to know that this doesn't change how I feel about you. I don't want to explore other relationships. This is an important part of who I am, though, so I wanted you to know.\"  Listen to your partner and answer their questions honestly. Be patient with them. They might need time to process this information, and that's okay. . Find a good time to talk to your parents, and then be honest with them. You can say, \"Mom, I'm bisexual. I've started dating a girl/I have a crush on a girl, so I wanted you to know that.\" Explain to them what being bisexual means to you, and that you have thought carefully about your sexuality. Your parents might indicate that they had already figured this out, or the conversation might get pretty emotional. Be prepared for your parents to react in these ways:   Asking what they did wrong Crying or grieving Asking if you are sure Asking if you just need more attention If you are a minor, you\u2019re probably still living at home. Even if you\u2019ve moved away to college, you might still be financially dependent on one or both parents. If you have any concerns that your parents might not be supportive, you might want to wait to tell them that you are bisexual. You don\u2019t want to risk no longer having a place to live or losing out on help with your tuition (such as money for college).  This is also something to consider if you live with your partner. Before telling them, you might want to take steps to make sure you are capable of being financially independent. Before you tell anyone at work, check your employer's non-discrimination policy. Make sure that you are protected from workplace discrimination. Then, you can talk to your co-workers in the same way that you talk to a friend. You could say, \"I just wanted to let you know that I'm bisexual. We've become work friends, and this is an important part of who I am, so I wanted to let you know.\"  Don't feel like you have to come out at work. Only do so if you are pretty certain you will find support. Even if your workplace has a non-discrimination policy, you may want to consider the people who are your supervisors. Do they support these non-discrimination rules or have they given you reasons to think they don\u2019t? It's essential that you are open with your doctor about your bisexuality. Bisexual women, in particular, often face health risks that are less common in cisgender straight people or lesbian women.

Do not modify the 5th and 21st sentences:\n\nChoose a magazine/file holder made of plastic, wood, metal wire, or sturdy cardboard and secure it in place with 2-4 screws. Most standard hairdryers fit perfectly into this spot. Alternatively, use several removable adhesive strips instead of screws. These take up much less space, since each hook can hold 2 large towels. The towels may also dry faster than if you use towel rods that are stacked one in front of the next. Buy peel-and-stick magnetic strips, or use removable adhesive strips to secure the magnets in place. Use the magnetic strips to hold tweezers, bobby pins, cosmetic brushes, and other magnetic objects. Check to see how many of your personal care items are magnetic before trying this. Instead of relying on elbow grease alone to scrub a tub or toilet, let your drill do the hard work! Look for different types of scrub brush attachments where cleaning supplies are sold.  Set the drill to its lowest speed first, then increase it as needed. Follow the brush attachment\u2019s instructions carefully. Don\u2019t use the attachment to clean fiberglass, laminate, wood, stone, or other surfaces unless the brush is specifically marketed for that purpose. Place the bucket on the floor directly in front of the sink. Place the larger end of the dustpan under the faucet so that the pan\u2019s handle is resting over the front edge of the sink. When you turn on the water it will flow through the channel in the handle, go over the edge, and fall like a waterfall into the bucket. Have some towels handy the first few times you try this. It may take a bit of practice to get the placement and water flow just right. This is a great hack if you have a bunch of similar-looking keys on your key ring. Gel nail polish adheres best to metal keys, but any type of polish will do. Hang or attach the shoe hanger to the back of a closet or pantry door, then fill the pockets with your cleaning bottles. Choose a shoe hanger with mesh or clear plastic pockets so you can easily differentiate the cleaning bottles.  If you have a hanging rod in the closet, get a shoe hanger with hooks. For safety, add a lock to the door if there are kids around. Different DIY removers may work better for different materials. Give the following a try:  For fabric, try hand sanitizer. For your skin or for wood surfaces, try rubbing alcohol. For painted walls, try hairspray or toothpaste. For ceramic or glass, mix 1 part white toothpaste and 1 part baking soda. After 30 minutes, use a wire brush or paintbrush cleaner to remove the loosened paint. Then, wash the brush with soap and water, rinse it, and let it air dry. If you heat the vinegar to nearly boiling in a pot on the stove, you can reduce the soaking time to 10 minutes. When painting a room, stir in 1\u00a0US\u00a0tbsp (15\u00a0ml) of vanilla extract per 1\u00a0US\u00a0gal (3.8\u00a0L) of paint. The vanilla will mask the unpleasant odor of the paint. Essential oils like peppermint work as well. This hack doesn\u2019t work on oil-based paint, since the vanilla extract or other essential oil creates a solution with the oils in the paint\u2014which may negate the pleasant scent you\u2019re aiming for or make the paint smell even worse. The oils aren\u2019t soluble with water-based paint, though, so they remain separate and help mask the paint odor.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 5th, and 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [5, 21]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.1818181818181818, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 5, 21], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"a\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 12, 15, 18], \"change\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"magnetic\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([5, 21], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}}

Aerobic exercise also releases endorphins, which will leave you feeling happier and more confident after a good sweat session. Feeling good will help you get through these 2 weeks since you\u2019ll be cutting calories and moving a lot more\u2014it can be tiresome but don\u2019t give up!  Always talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. If you are new to exercise, start slow and easy until you can work your way up to 30 or 40 minutes. For instance, start by jogging for 15 minutes and walking for the remaining 15 minutes. Then, after the first week, jog for the full 30 minutes, upping your speed and intensity. Picking something you enjoy is going to make the next 2 weeks a lot easier. Swimming, kickboxing, dancing, and various sports will count toward your daily 30 minutes (minimum) of aerobic exercise. Whatever activity you choose, make sure to get your heart pumping for at least 20 to 30 minutes so you work up a good sweat.  Swimming is a great low-impact option that won\u2019t hurt your joints. Take a dance class with friends or family members to up the fun factor! Lifting weights will build lean muscle, which is necessary to rev your metabolism and burn fat throughout the day. A combination of strength training and aerobic exercise is more effective to lose weight faster than just doing one or the other.  Strength training doesn\u2019t count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If you don\u2019t know the proper form for dumbbell exercises, use the weight machines. If you plan to weigh yourself every few days, keep in mind that muscle weighs more than fat. But don\u2019t worry, those muscles will help you blast more belly fat for the next 2 weeks! Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, lateral raises, and chest presses. Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. You should use enough weight so you can maintain good form for the full set but also need to rest between sets. HIIT elevates your heart rate and keeps your muscles guessing. It\u2019s also more effective at blasting more calories in a shorter period of time (as opposed to low intensity training with little to no variations). Work in HIIT at least 3 or 4 times a week (or you can do shorter HIIT routines every day in addition to aerobic exercise).   For example, perform 30 to 60 second sprints while jogging. Recover with 2 to 4 minutes of jogging at a moderate pace before the next burst. Even walking can be adjusted for an HIIT workout by changing your speed and adding hills. Walking is a great alternative if you have bad knees or other joint problems. Try this 20 minute treadmill routine:  3 minute warmup at 5% incline 3 minute brisk walk at 7% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 2 minute moderate walk at 7% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 2 minute slow to moderate walk at 15% incline 1 minute moderate walk at 10% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 3 minute cool down at 5% incline every day to increase strength, toning, and balance. Working your core will help build and tone your abdominal and back muscles. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cspot\u201d training, but the more you engage your core, the more lean muscle you\u2019ll build, and the more calories you\u2019ll burn throughout the day.  As a plus, your posture will improve after just a week of core training (making you look leaner)! Try some common yoga moves like planks, warrior twists, and cobras to stretch and tone your core. . Make an effort to take the stairs or walk around more for the next 2 weeks. Take a 10 to 20 minute walk after eating to help your body digest, burn extra calories, and keep your metabolism running.  Get off the bus or subway a few stops early and walk the rest of the way. Run errands on foot if you live close to your regular shops. If possible, walk or bike to work. Climb the stairs instead of using the elevator or escalator.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 39 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 39}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(39, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain fewer than 55 tokens:\n\nThe continual expansion and evolution of artificial intelligence have provided a fertile ground for the proliferation of large language models [Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Ethayarajh, 2019; Lewis et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022], thereby effecting a transformative shift in the landscape of natural language processing across diverse domains. This sweeping change has engendered keen interest in the potential application of these models in the financial realm. It is, however, evident that the acquisition of high-quality, relevant, and up-to-date data stands as a critical factor in the development of an efficacious and efficient open-source financial language model. Utilizing language models in the financial arena reveals intricate hurdles. These range from difficulties in obtaining data, dealing with diverse data formats and types, and managing data quality inconsistencies, to the essential requirement of up-to-date information. Especially, historical or specialized financial data extraction proves to be complex due to varying data mediums such as web platforms, APIs, PDF documents, and images. In the proprietary sphere, models like BloombergGPT [Wu et al., 2023] have capitalized on their exclusive access to specialized data to train finance-specific language models. However, the restricted accessibility and transparency of their data collections and training protocols have accentuated the demand for a more open and inclusive alternative. In response to this demand, we are witnessing a shifting trend towards democratizing Internet-scale financial data in the open-source domain. In this paper, we address these aforementioned challenges associated with financial data and introduce FinGPT, an endto-end open-source framework for financial large language models (FinLLMs). Adopting a data-centric approach, FinGPT underscores the crucial role of data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing in developing open-source FinLLMs. By championing data accessibility, FinGPT aspires to enhance research, collaboration, and innovation in finance, paving the way for open finance practices. Our contributions are summarized as follows: \u2022 Democratization: FinGPT, as an open-source framework, aims to democratize financial data and FinLLMs, uncovering untapped potentials in open finance. \u2022 Data-centric approach: Recognizing the significance of data curation, FinGPT adopts a data-centric approach and implements rigorous cleaning and preprocessing methods for handling varied data formats and types, thereby ensuring high-quality data. \u2022 End-to-end framework: FinGPT embraces a full-stack framework for FinLLMs with four layers: \u2013 Data source layer: This layer assures comprehensive market coverage, addressing the temporal sensitivity             \fof financial data through real-time information capture. \u2013 Data engineering layer: Primed for real-time NLP data processing, this layer tackles the inherent challenges of high temporal sensitivity and low signal-tonoise ratio in financial data. \u2013 LLMs layer: Focusing on a range of fine-tuning methodologies, this layer mitigates the highly dynamic nature of financial data, ensuring the model\u2019s relevance and accuracy. \u2013 Application layer: Showcasing practical applications and demos, this layer highlights the potential capability of FinGPT in the financial sector.

Ensure that the output contains fewer than 31 sentences:\n\nMake sure that your head is in line with your spine, and that your shoulders, neck, and jaw muscles are relaxed. Maintaining a neutral posture will ensure you are using your body most efficiently, while also preventing any added stress to your body. Square your shoulders and hips in the direction of your sprint, and brace your core muscles. Point your toes forward as well, and avoid turning them outward, as this will interfere with your stride. Keep your eyes looking down on the track approximately 20 meters (65.6\u00a0ft) in front of you. The power in your legs will serve as the force behind your sprint. Take your first stride by pushing off with your toes and extending your dominant knee until it reaches a locked horizontal position above the hips. The angle between your shin and your foot should be at least 90 degrees, and your thigh should be parallel to the ground. At the peak of your stride, when the knee of your lead leg has reached a horizontal position above your hips, the joints of your supporting leg - in your ankle, knee, and hip - should all be fully extended. Stand on the ball of the foot of your supporting leg with your heel slightly off the ground. Aim to keep your landing foot about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10\u00a0cm) in front of the hip to apply force on contact \u2013 more than this and you will break, too little and you will lose stability. After you land, drive your heel to your buttocks as your other leg drives forward, repeating the motions from the previous step. Alternating these strike-and-land steps will bring you to a stride. Executing these moves while gathering up as much energy as possible from your legs, arms, and core will bring you up to sprinting speed. Avoid striking your heel, or overstriding. Overstriding is inefficient for sprinting and can lead to serious foot or lower-leg injuries. Your wrists should be straight. At the peak of your stride, your hand should approach the height of your nose; when your arm drives backward, your hand should pass your buttocks.  Try to extend your fingers in order to increase the lever of your arm. Don\u2019t ball your hands into fists or move them as fast as possible \u2013 this can disrupt your arm swing. All of your arm movement should drive forward from the shoulder joints. Keep your shoulders relaxed, and swing your arms smoothly. The power and frequency of your arm movements will directly impact the speed of your strides. Your arms and legs should be balanced: when your lead leg moves forward, the arm on that same side should move backward. When your arms swing forward, they should stay close to your body, and when they swing backward, they can swing to a more open position. Avoid flailing your arms, as this will throw off your balance and waste energy. The mechanics of sprinting are very detailed, and may feel unnatural at first. Take some time to learn the form while you\u2019re still a beginner in order to get faster on the track and avoid stress-related injuries.  Use your warm-up as an opportunity to go through proper form at a slower pace. If possible, working with a trainer will help you learn proper form. Especially as a beginner, even one or two sessions will go a long way in helping you internalize the right movements. Try videotaping your sprint sessions and watching them after your workout to analyze your form and look for ways to improve.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain fewer than 14 words:\n\nJust as you\u2019ve been getting used to the cold outside, you should be making an effort to get acclimated to the cold inside as well. People most often keep the temperature in their homes in the low- to mid-seventies, as this is most hospitable to the body\u2019s equilibrium. Try turning yours down a few degrees at a time until you can stand living in a cooler space. Toughing out a cold house is also a great way to save on the cost of utilities during the winter. Just check with your family or roommates first if you don\u2019t live alone. The next time you get chilly and you\u2019re tempted to grab a cozy throw blanket or pair of house shoes, don\u2019t. Instead, bear it, and do something to take your mind off the chill if you need to. The idea is to break yourself of the need to always be covered up with warm layers when it\u2019s cold and instead learn to cope with it on your own. If you\u2019ve gotten used to living in cooler temperatures and have been taking cold showers routinely, this step should be a breeze.  If you find yourself having a hard time resisting that comforter or quilt, fold it and put it away on the top shelf of a closet. You\u2019ll be less likely to reach for it if it\u2019s put away and you have to go to the trouble of getting it out again. Your body temperature naturally drops slightly when you sleep, so if you want a crash course in developing willpower, train yourself to sleep without a blanket! Make ice water your go-to drink of choice, even in the dead of winter. Ingesting an icy beverage lowers your internal temperature ever-so-slightly, which will force your body\u2019s adaptive responses to compensate for the change. Whereas most people turn to coffee or hot chocolate in the colder months to get warm, you should be doing the opposite. Eventually, you\u2019ll no longer even feel the need to warm up. In addition to being a useful tool for building up your cold tolerance, ice water is also usually free and can be found almost anywhere. Desensitizing yourself to the cold doesn\u2019t have to be all stern-faced discipline. Take up an outdoor winter sport like sledding, skiing or snowboarding and give yourself a fun way to get outside while everyone else is huddled up indoors. You\u2019ll become one with the cold much faster, and you\u2019ll also have an enjoyable way to pass the cold months instead remaining cooped up.  Take a camping trip in the late fall or winter for a head-first approach to dealing with cold.

Each sentence contains more than one token:\n\nAfter being dumped, you may find yourself wanting the person even more. You might beg your boyfriend not to leave or resort to a variety of embarrassing tactics to prevent him from going through with the break-up. Research shows that emotional pain can often resemble a physical pain. You will do virtually anything to make it stop. This is a common reaction after a sudden break-up. Therefore, you must set a few precautions to prevent any dramatic actions on your behalf.  Avoid your boyfriend at all costs until you have fully come to terms with being dumped. Refrain from showing up at his doorstep and questioning his motives. If you must, delete his cell phone number and email address from your contacts list. Sure, you may remember them by heart, but the simple action of pressing \"delete\" can bring you some closure. Plus, the shock of scrolling through your contacts and not seeing him listed may be just what you need to remind you that you shouldn't be reaching out. When someone breaks your heart, and you don't see it coming, you are bound to experience a range of emotions. You may have a desire to push these emotions away. You may tell yourself \"He's not worth my tears\". Having loved someone at all means you should, at least, allow yourself to properly grieve the relationship. There are seven stages you can expect to go through while grieving.  Questioning - You are consumed by a desire to understand what happened or what went wrong. You may try to seek out your ex. You may argue with friends and relatives. You may even consult absolute strangers to find clarity about what happened. Denial - You have trouble accepting that your relationship has truly ended. You may continue to hope that your love together can be saved. You may refuse to believe otherwise. Bargaining - You offer up any and every solution just as long as you two can stay together. You promise to change. You will be the perfect girlfriend. You try to take responsibility for the entire relationship. Relapse - You manage to convince your ex to give the relationship another shot, only to go through the same break-up process all over again. Afterwards, you are finally convinced that it cannot be saved. Anger - This stage occurs when you have released some of your fears about being single and can now recognize that you deserved better than what you got. Your anger may be directed at yourself, your ex, or the circumstances. Initial acceptance - At this point, you are \"going along\" with the break-up because you have no choice. You are starting to see that the two of you just aren't meant to be. You finally stop trying to resolve things. Redirected Hope - As you come to accept the circumstances, you start to assess the possibility that you may be okay on the other side of the break-up. You begin to feel some level of hope that your future--whatever it includes--will be brighter. When a relationship ends, you often feel resigned to just get by in life. You may lie around in sorrow. Eat your share of junk foods. Rewatch your favorite TV shows or movies. Yes, you have to grieve, but recognize that the wallowing isn't a requirement. Set a precise deadline for yourself--it can be a week, two weeks, or a month (depending on the seriousness or the length of the relationship). Tell yourself, after that deadline, you will no longer sit around wasting your days in misery. Make an active choice to lead a meaningful life, alone for now. As you are trying to successfully grieve your relationship it's a good idea to temporarily purge your life of any reminders of your doomed relationship. Holding on to personal items basically demonstrates that you expect him to come back some day. Toss these out in order to move on with your life. Getting rid of these things doesn't have to mean throwing them away. Toss pictures, gifts, love notes, and such in a box to tuck away in storage or in an attic. Later, when you have fully grieved and come to terms with the loss of the relationship, you can decide what to do with these items.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 1 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 1}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.16666666666666669, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")", "word_count_check(1, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"you\", 1, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"the\", 1, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ex\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"him\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"the\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3], \"change\")"]}}}

These advanced computational models have revolutionized various domains, including robotics, where LLMs are increasingly employed to bridge the communication gap between humans and machines. This allows robots to execute tasks based on complex human instructions. However, as LLMs are widely used in robotics applications, an increasing number of challenges arise in accurately interpreting humans\u2019 natural language commands that are ambiguous or contain their personal preferences, which are unknown to the robots. Our research is motivated by growing concerns about hallucination and inconsistency in LLMs as reported in recent literature [8]\u2013[10]. Hallucination refers to generating false or misleading information that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the input provided. This is particularly problematic in robotic applications, as LLMs can misinterpret humans\u2019 instructions or generate unsafe commands when they hallucinate, ultimately impeding the applicability of LLM-integrated systems. Additionally, the inconsistency, referring to the phenomenon of LLMs producing different responses to the same query, The work was supported by funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and the SDAIA-KAUST Center of Excellence in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (SDAIA-KAUST AI). Abugurain and Park are with Electrical and Computer Engineering Program, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). {mohammed.abugurain,  further complicates the use of LLMs in scenarios where reliability of the robotic systems is crucial. These issues limit the functional scope of robots and raise concerns about safety, especially in environments where human-robot interaction is frequent. In this work, we address these limitations by enhancing the reliability of LLMs for robot motion planning and execution. We propose a framework that effectively detects and corrects misinterpretation and inconsistencies, thereby bridging the gap between the potential of LLMs and their practical, reliable application in robotics. Our framework, which can be integrated into existing robotic systems using LLMs, minimizes ambiguity in human natural language instructions, enabling robots to understand and execute the instructions with improved reliability. This is challenging because human natural language is inherently ambiguous, where meanings are frequently implied rather than explicitly stated. For instance, given an instruction \u201cGo to the room where I forgot my keys\u201d, the robot must understand where the user forgot their keys to plan and execute the navigation command. Furthermore, the robot needs to determine whether a given human instruction contains all the information about their preferences required to execute the instructed task. To illustrate, consider an instruction \u201cGo to the room I like the most\u201d. The instruction appears unambiguous as there is exactly one room the user likes the most, but it does not indicate which room they like the most. In this example, the robot must detect that the instruction is incomplete and ask the user for more information about their preference. Drawing from these two examples, we consider ambiguity as the uncertainty in a sentence\u2019s meaning that allows for multiple, equally probable interpretations. Instructions with unspecified preferences, though not ambiguous, are regarded as incomplete, necessitating additional information on the preferences to complete the task. This paper posits that ambiguity is a universal phenomenon, not specific to any particular user, while preference is user-specific. As our main contributions, we develop a framework capable of resolving ambiguity in natural language instructions and clarifying them through meaningful queries. Additionally, it can detect whether the instructions contain all the necessary information regarding user preferences, query the users whenever additional details are required to complete the task, and also retain this information for future use.

For example, one is conducting a conversation about commonsense scenarios. However, our interaction with LLMs has led us to observe that the models tend to emphasize the normal flow of events and seem to struggle with questions involving a negated form of verbs, such as not or cannot. An example of that is in Figure 1. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on demonstrating the issue and then suggest an approach to remedy the problem. To better clarify the problem statement, we start with an example and then formalize it using elements of the set theory. Let us look at the scenario in Figure 1; the standard question is \u201cWho PersonX can be?\u201d. The answer to this question is Santa Claus. The answer to the negated complementary question \u2013 \u201cWho PersonX cannot be?\u201d \u2013 should be all valid answers which are not the answer to the standard (can be) question. A valid answer fits the scenario described. In this case, we Figure 2: Venn diagram of answer sets: U is the universal set of answers; V is the set of all valid answers that includes two sets \u2013 correct answers to a standard question A, and correct answers to its negated complementary version NC . ask about a person, so a non-person cannot be a valid answer. To better illustrate the concept of a negated complementary question, we refer to the basic notion of the complement of a set, Figure 2. Furthermore, we define a set of correct answers to a negated complementary, Equation 1. NC = V \u2229 A\u2032 = {x | x \u2208 V \u2227 x /\u2208 A} (1) where NC represents answers to the negated complementary question, V is the set of all valid answers, A is the set of correct answers to the standard question, and A\u2032 is the complement of A under the universal set of all answers (U ). We focus our efforts on commonsensical ques22 l u J 1 ] L C . s c [ v96.02 : v i X r a GPT-3PersonX is wearing red and white clothes and is going down a stranger\u2019s home\u2019s chimney.Who PersonX cannot be?Santa ClausPersonX is not Santa Claus.PersonX cannot be Santa Claus.Santa ClausSanta ClausInstructionsExamplesLogicGPT-3Santa ClausSanta ClausBurglarBurglarBurglar\u2705\u2705\u2705\u274c\u274cPostProcessBurglarBurglar\u2705\u2705Burglar\u2705\u274c\u274c\u274c\u2795\u26a0 \u26a0 UNCAV            \ftions as the uncertainty of results depends on the context and experiences of people answering the questions. As defined in (LeCun, 2022), commonsense is a collection of world models representing what is likely, plausible, or impossible. In light of that, our goal is to assess the ability of LLMs to answer plausible questions that could be refuted or accepted in a given context. Given their pre-training nature, we hypothesize that LLMs have an inherent bias towards likely scenarios, which are the most repeated in the common text. Most of the text available on the web contains information supporting answers to \u2018positive\u2019 questions, like, how to do things or where to go, not to questions such as how things could not be done or where not to go. It results in an imbalance of the training datasets due to the sparsity of plausible or impossible scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs have difficulty answering negated complementary questions, which results in responses representing plausible, but not impossible, answers. Although LLMs are shown to have this shortcoming, we claim that enough instructions and examples, especially showing reasoning processes, can guide the LLMs into the right path to answer negated complementary questions with commonsense context. Our contributions are as follows. (1) We present an analysis exposing the shortcomings of LLMs when it comes to negated complementary questions in commonsensical scenarios. (2) We propose a novel methodology to improve the performance of the GPT-3 model when negated complementary questions are asked; compare the results with the results obtained using conventional methods.

Instead, describe your work and education history, as well as what you've done to make you a great fit for the position.  Specify your past accomplishments, specifically the ones that are related to the job you're applying for.  Practice providing a summary about your work and educational background before your interview. Say, \"After I finished my MBA, I spent two years working for a start-up where I learned how to start and expand a business.\" No matter why you're on the job search, speak positively of your past jobs. The interviewer will be looking for red flags in your answer that could indicate that you'll be a problem for the organization. Use your answer as a way to show that you are a better fit for the job you're interviewing for than for your old job, which you've outgrown.  Avoid complaining about your old job or coworkers. Don't lie about your job. Instead, just focus on the positive details. If you've had a rough time at your current job, make a list of the positive aspects of the job, what you've learned there, and how you've contributed to the organization so that you're ready to give answers. Say, \"In my current position, I've been on the ground floor of a growing business. While I've enjoyed learning how to build a thriving company, I'm looking for a role in a more established firm.\" Your interviewer will want to know how well you work with others. They may ask you questions like, \u201cHow would you describe your work habits,\u201d \u201cCan you tell me about a time that you worked with a team to accomplish a project,\u201d or \u201cWould you rather work alone or with a team.\u201d It's important that you show them that, while you can work well independently, you're also able to work well with others.  Provide specific examples of how you've successfully worked on a team.  Prepare a list ahead of your interview so that you're ready to prove you're good at working with others. Say, \"While I'm definitely a self-starter who can work alone, my current position often involves team work. On my last project, I worked with a committee to implement a growth plan.\" You will most likely be asked about a time you've had a conflict with a coworker, supervisor, or professor. The interviewer wants to know that you can see an issue from multiple points-of-view and work collaboratively toward a solution. This is your chance to explain that you can negotiate a compromise and understand where others are coming from.  Before the interview, brainstorm a good example that you can provide to show a time you successfully worked through a issue. This doesn't have to be the biggest conflict you've had. Write out your point-of-view on the incident, what the other person seemed to think, and how you resolved the conflict. Say, \"In grad school I had a classmate that scheduled project meetings at times she knew I couldn't meet because she was worried that there were too many people working on our project. I contacted her to talk about what I could offer the group, and we were able to work out a schedule that suited everyone. In the end, she and I were the lead authors on the paper we produced.\" Everyone has conflicts, so telling the interviewer that you haven't will be a red flag. Most interviewers ask you to identify a weakness. The interviewer wants to know if you are able to acknowledge areas where you need improvement, and how open you are to receiving professional development. Your goal is to show that you are a \u201clifetime learner\u201d who is passionate about receiving performance feedback and seeking growth.  Say, \"In the past I've struggled with assertiveness, which has affected my work performance. However, I've gone to two assertiveness seminars on my own time, and the techniques I've learned have helped me tremendously.\" Resist the temptation to give a strength as a weakness, such as \u201cI work too hard,\u201d or \u201cI'm too dedicated to my work.\u201d Your interviewer will see through this, and you'll lose the opportunity to show that you are growth-minded, which is what the interviewer wants to see. Some HR interviewers will ask you what your references will say about you, so talk to them ahead of time to find out what they might say. At the very least, think about what you think they may say before you go into the interview so that you won't be caught off-guard. Say, \"My references will likely say that I'm dependable and resourceful.\"\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}}}

Kicking a well-inflated ball is important to keep the ball from getting wrecked and your foot from getting bruised. Soccer balls, kickballs, footballs, and foam-style Nerf balls are all appropriate for kicking off the ground. You can use this to take shots, American football kickoffs, and other plays in sports that involve kicking a round or oblong ball off the ground. Do not kick basketballs. When you kick a ball, most of the time you'll want to do it with your dominant foot, usually the foot on the same side of your body that you write with. This is your kicking foot and the other foot is your plant foot. Practice on your non-dominant foot too, to become a better kicker. Even if you're not playing an organized sport, being an ambidextrous kicker is a cool trick. For soccer especially, learning to kick with both feet is desirable. Taking a few pre-kick steps helps to increase the power behind your kicks as well as your accuracy. Learning to coordinate your steps, plant your foot, and approach the ball properly is one of the most important parts of kicking a ball. Using the right technique will always allow you to kick a ball farther than a super-strong leg. To approach the ball properly:  Lead with your non-kicking foot. Take a few steps back from the ball and step toward it with your non-kicking foot. Take one more step with your kicking foot, lining it up behind the ball. Your last step will be with your non-kicking, or \"plant\" foot, just beside the ball you're about to kick. A common mistake a lot of kickers make is taking too many steps back to kick the ball. 15 steps won't give you more power than three, if you use the right mechanics, but it will make it more likely that you'll stumble, or whiff the ball. Your other foot should be planted a few inches to the side of the ball you're about to kick, with your kicking leg cocked back behind you and ready to strike.  Plant your foot forward to keep the ball low. If your plant foot is slightly ahead and to the side of the ball, you'll be able to put lots of power behind your kick, and it'll stay low to the ground. Plant your foot behind the ball to chip it up. If your plant foot is slightly behind and to the side of the ball, you'll be able to put a little more air into the kick, but perhaps slightly less power. The power from a kick comes from your hip. Your kicking leg should be cocked back behind you when you plant your other foot beside the ball, and should extend and swing forward simultaneously to make contact with the ball. Imagine a magnet that connects your foot to the ball, drawing your kicking foot ever closer until you make contact. Whether you're kicking a soccer ball or a kickball, the technique may be basically the same, but you'll need to use a different part of your foot depending on your purposes. Using the laces on the top of your foot, your toe pointed down, helps you to put power behind it, while the in-step of your foot is perfect for accuracy.  If you want power, kick the ball with the hardest part of your foot, the seam that runs just to the side of your laces. Point your toe and strike the ball with the top of your foot. If you want accuracy, use the instep of your foot. You'll need to rotate your ankle to the side slightly to use your foot as a kind of mallet, striking with the arch on the side of your foot. Drive through the ball and extend your kicking leg, pointing your toe where you want the ball to end up. When you're striking the ball hard, it's important to follow through with your kick, rather than stabbing at the ball.  Imagine that you're kicking through the ball, as if you were trying to punch through it, or kick the opposite side of the ball to the one you're actually kicking. Depending on the kind of kick you're taking and the power behind it, you might land on your kicking foot by taking a little hop forward and letting your momentum carry you, or you might hop up and land on your plant foot.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}}}

Recently we have been going to an indoor skatepark where she feels comfortable and has been practicing the two things she wants to accomplish.  She is very close with the ollies and is challenging herself with a rolling or flat practice, instead of on carpet.  We were rotating between the quarter pipes, dropping in and turning, and ollie practice on the flat land last weekend before the park got too crowded.  She was doing well and feeling encourage, telling me she felt good during our water breaks and how close she thought she was on reaching her goals.  On the big drop in, I used a big padded mattress to break her falls and give her some protection as she felt more comfortable with the height and sensation.  After about 10 runs where I moved the pad further and further back and she looked like she had the drop, we decided to run it pad free.  I offered to stand with a hand out in case she needed it and she looked good and confident at the top.  As she dropped, she slapped my hand and made it to the bottom of the ramp and onto the flat, but she was moving pretty fast.  On the flat she lost balance and went down on her back and whacked her helmeted head.  She was stunned and hurt and crying - partially from the pain and some for the shock and embarrassment.   I saw her fall and knew there was no serious injury, so I got her up and walked her to our bench to drink some water and catch her breath.  We took her helmet off and I got her to walk around the park, to walk it off mentally and physically for a few minutes.  When we got back to the bench, she put her helmet back on. I asked her what she was doing - \"going back out there Dad\"I cannot put into words how that made me feel, her getting back on the horse without any real encouragement from me.  It was awesome, she is awesome and I am a very proud Dad.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 19 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain more than 7 tokens:\n\nBeing honest means not lying to or misleading your girlfriend, which should be easy enough. But being open requires you to make yourself vulnerable on some level, which many people struggle with. If being open and honest doesn't come naturally to you, you'll need to work on it with your partner for the sake of your relationship.  Open, honest communication is the foundation of a strong relationship. If you cannot be open and honest with one another, you will inevitably encounter problems down the line. Tell your girlfriend the full truth. Don't hold back or withhold your feelings, because she may be upset if she finds out about it. If you're struggling with being open, let your partner know about the problem and try to explain the reasons why. If she knows you struggle with it, she can be extra supportive, and may learn to ask you prompting questions or request elaborations. Many people are in such a hurry to get all their thoughts/feelings out in the open that they fail to pause and reflect on what's being said. This is true of both speaking your mind in general, as well as speaking in response to something your girlfriend has said.  Think carefully about what it is you want to say before you speak. Be aware of what you're feeling when you talk to your girlfriend. Speak as clearly and directly as possible. If you're responding to something your partner said, give her a second to make sure she's finished talking. Then take a brief second to process what she's said and think about how to best articulate your response. You should always strive to be as respectful as possible in every conversation you have with your girlfriend. Respect may be an obvious requirement for many people, but it's important to be aware of your words, your tone, the subtext of your conversation, and your body language to always convey mutual respect for one another.  Take responsibility for what you say and do during a conversation, even if it escalates to an argument. You should both fully express your thoughts and feelings, but you need to do so respectfully. Validate your partner's feelings. Try to understand why your girlfriend feels the way she does, and at the very least respect the fact that she feels that way.  Convey a respectful posture. Don't slouch, avoid eye contact, or do other tasks while listening to your girlfriend. Face her and give her your full attention. Be respectful in any responses you give. Don't interrupt your girlfriend, and never say that she's wrong to feel a certain way. If there's any kind of misunderstanding between you, don't get mad or upset. Instead, you should calmly ask questions and try to get your girlfriend to clarify what she means. When emotions rise, especially during a fight or after you've been hurt somehow, it's easy to slip into declarative statements (such as \"You are a liar and you hurt my feelings.\"). But psychologists agree that using \"I\" statements are far more effective and cause less tension. Using an \"I\" statement simply means framing your hurt feelings as a way that you feel, rather than as an accusation or an absolute about your partner. A good \"I\" statement should include the following components:  A statement of emotion (\"I feel _____\") A fair and unemotional description of the behavior causing you to feel the way you feel (\"I feel _____ when you ______\") An explanation of why the behavior or conditions at hand cause you to feel the way you do (\"I feel ____ when you _____, because it _________\") If you haven't been dating for a long time, or if you are new to sharing your feelings in general, it's best to take things slowly. You should still work on communicating with one another every day, but you and your partner should have a frank conversation about how comfortable you are with divulging your personal thoughts/feelings, and what kind of time frame you might need to get to that point.  Don't rush into deep, troubling, or difficult conversations. Let them come naturally when you're both ready to talk about such things. Don't rush your partner, and don't let her rush you. Go by what you are both comfortable with, and know that any effort at improving communication will help strengthen your relationship. Self-disclosure statements can be very useful in a relationship, especially if you're new to sharing your feelings or talking about deeply personal things. They're a way for you to reveal yourself incrementally but candidly to your partner, with the assumption that she will talk about herself as well. Try building off of the following self-disclosing cues to get started:  I am a person who _____. One thing I wish people knew about me is _______. When I try to express intimate feelings, _____________.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

The output should contain more than 19 sentences:\n\nCut an avocado in half using a sharp knife and carefully remove the pit. In a clean bowl, mash 1/2 of the avocado with a fork until no chunks remain. You can also spoon the avocado into a blender or food processor and blend for a few seconds until smooth.  Make sure that you use a ripe avocado so that you can easily break down any chunks and mash or blend until smooth. If your hair is very thick and/or long, you might need to use the whole avocado. If you only use half though, you can store the avocado half for future use. For added nutrients, add 1 egg, 1 tablespoon (15\u00a0mL) of plain yogurt, 1 tablespoon (15\u00a0mL) of olive oil, or a few drops of your favorite essential oil, such as peppermint or lavender.\u00a0You can mix all of these at once, or just add one or a few of these add-ins depending on your hair type and desired effect. Use a fork to stir, or add to your blender or food processor until your add-in is completely mixed with the mashed avocado.  Olive oil is highly conditioning and can help prevent breakage and promote hair growth. Yogurt helps strengthen your hair and can make it extra shiny. Eggs contain vitamins A and E, as well as biotin, which help promote healthy growth. Essential oils add nutrients and can help mask any unpleasant smells. Avocado alone is rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and vitamins, so feel free to skip this step if you just want to use a simple avocado conditioner.  If you are using the whole avocado instead of just half, double the add-ins. For example, for a whole avocado worth of paste, you will need 2 tablespoons (30\u00a0mL) of plain yogurt. Using your hands, scoop up a dollop of the avocado paste and massage it into a section of your hair for about 1 minute. Repeat this process until all of your hair is covered and you have used all of the paste.  If you have really thick and/or long hair, you may need to make a bit more of the paste at this point to cover all of your hair.\u00a0 It might be a good idea to wear clothes that you don\u2019t mind staining, or you can wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. This will give your hair ample time to absorb the nutrients from the avocado paste. You can leave your hair uncovered, or you can protect your clothes and surroundings by putting on a shower cap, or by lightly wrapping your hair in a towel. After you have let the avocado paste sit in your hair for 15 minutes, wash it out thoroughly with water. Once the mixture is rinsed out of your hair, dry and style your hair as usual. Your hair should feel extra soft and smooth. Avocado paste alone should not make your hair greasy or weighed down, so you shouldn\u2019t need to use shampoo to get it all out. If you use olive oil or an egg as add-ins, however, you may need to use your regular shampoo to get all of the treatment out. For best results, condition your hair with an avocado paste once every 2 weeks. This will keep your hair moisturized and shiny without weighing it down. Feel free to experiment with different add-ins every 2 weeks until you find what works best for your hair.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 19 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"]}}}

To produce enough steam to help, go into the bathroom and turn on the hot water in the shower, closing the door to keep the steam inside. Remain in the bathroom with the hot water running for three to five minutes. The nasal secretions should be loose and ready to be blown out of your nose after this time. You can also place your head over a large bowl of just boiled water and cover your head with a towel to hold in the steam. Breathe this for about 10 minutes, or until you feel your nasal congestion get better.  If you feel dizziness during either method, step into fresh air, have a seat, and breath normally. This will pass. It is not anything to be alarmed about and will resolve in a few minutes. You can use essential oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint in the bathroom as well. They have shown promise in their natural decongestant properties and may prove beneficial. Eucalyptus oil has been shown to have decongestant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, which should help to clear your sinuses and aid in prevention of a sinus infection. To use, drop five to 10 drops of the oil in the tub or bowl of water. Keep essential oils away from children. They can cause serious problems and possibly death if ingested or used in the wrong way. Sometimes, your sinuses may be really dry, which can add to sinus congestion. Humidifiers can help much in the same way as steam. Keep it on while you are around the house or while you sleep in order for it to increase the moisture level in your nose and help loosen nasal secretions. You can apply around five drops of essential oils such as eucalyptus or peppermint into your humidifier water to help with your congestion. Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial, decongestant, and anti-inflammatory properties that can help your condition. Heat can also help your nasal congestion and drain your sinuses. Take a moist washcloth and place it in the microwave for two to three minutes. The temperature should be hot but tolerable. Place the cloth across your nose and allow it to sit until the heat is gone. Repeat this as needed. It should loosen secretions and permit clearance from your nose with blowing. Use care not to burn yourself as you remove the washcloth from the microwave. All microwaves are different and yours may have heated the cloth too hot. Saline spray is beneficial in loosening nasal congestion. To make your own, mix  8oz of warm water with one half teaspoon of salt in a bowl. To administer it, buy a bulb suction device at the store. Place the long end of the bulb suction device in the bowl of solution, push on it to release water, then let the bulb go so the bulb will fill. Next, place the small end in your nose and administer two sprays into each nostril to add the liquid to your nasal secretions, which will facilitate blowing. You may also buy saline (non-medicated) nasal sprays and drops at the pharmacy. You can use nasal saline sprays every few hours as there is no medicine in them to worry about. Nasal saline drops are very safe and effective even for babies. A neti pot is a miniature tea pot shaped device can cleanse your sinus passages by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. To use, fill the pot with warm water around 120 degrees. Tilt your head to the left and a little bit back and place the spout of the pot at your right nostril. Raise the pot up and pour water into your right nostril. It will drain out the left nostril. Make sure the water is clean and sterile. Boil the water beforehand to warm it and remove all the impurities if you are unsure about the safety of your water supply. There are drinks and food that can help with your sinus issues. Try hot tea, which will have a similar effect to steam. The heat from the tea will heat up your sinus passages and help them drain. Any type of tea you prefer is fine, though peppermint and lavender may have additional benefits with sinus congestion.  Also change up the way you eat. Try hot salsa, hot peppers, hot wings, or any food you prefer that has a spicy kick to it. The added heat to your system will help heat up your sinuses and get your secretions running. Hot soup or broth can also help loosen the sinuses. Although you may not feel like exercising when you have sinus congestion, the physical activity can help increase the flow of the mucus in your sinuses, which will help with the clearance of nasal secretions. Try some aerobic exercise for 15 to 20 minutes to help you. If you are allergic to pollen or other outside substances, try exercising inside at a gym or at home to avoid increases exposure to irritating allergens. Sometimes, you can use your hand to help drain your sinuses. Apply gentle pressure using your index and middle fingers, rotating in a circular motion over the forehead, the bridge of your nose, beside your eyes, and under your eyes. Use an oil such as rosemary oil along your forehead to help open up your sinus passages. This manual manipulation can manually or structurally break up secretions as well as warm the area with the action of your hands.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"]}}}

If either of the mating pair of bulldogs has had to have surgery in order to open up their nostrils, trim back parts of their soft palates, or remove their tonsils, do not breed them. The genetics for a crowded throat will be passed onto the pups and will perpetuate these distressing problems.  Even if your bulldogs haven\u2019t required surgery, you should still avoid breeding them if they struggle to breathe. Do not breed the female during summer months if she has breathing troubles. The hot weather will compound the issue during pregnancy and cause the bitch undue distress. Evidence suggests that the character of the mother is passed onto her puppies. If she is excessively nervous or she is aggressive, her puppies are likely to have similar non ideal behavior patterns. The best bitch to breed from is a calm, friendly, and gentle dog. A calmer female will also make a better mother who is less likely to be snappy or insecure when it comes to her puppies. It is vital to ensure that she has healthy skin and is free from skin parasites. A form of mange caused by the demodex mite can be made much worse by the stress of pregnancy, and she could lose her fur and develop a rhino-like skin. In addition, the demodex mite can be transferred to the pups at whelping, which means they are born with the mite and will go on to have poor coats and skin. Not only is this undesirable but it can make the pups harder to sell, so you are more likely to be left with them on your hands. One full month before you want to breed your English bulldogs,  you should have your veterinarian perform a full physical examination of the female. Ensure that she is up to date on all vaccinations, that she\u2019s free of any worms, and that she does not test positive for brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can cause spontaneous abortion.  You should also have the veterinarian perform a genetic screening. Even healthy bulldogs can still pass on undesirable genetic traits. Responsible breeding should always seek to weed out traits that can lead to health complications associated with the breed.  The stud (male bulldog) you choose should also be tested for brucellosis. Your bulldog will have her first heat sometime after six months of age, but you should never breed a bitch before her second heat, which she will have every six months after her first one.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'should'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "should", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3636363636363636, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword('should')", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"should\", 24, \"equal\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], \"change\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"breeders\", \"remove\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(1200, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should\", \"keep\")"]}}}

You will, however, be able to access the files of the main account. If the user you're trying to hack is a local user (e.g., a user added to the computer by a Microsoft account), you can change their password like you could in previous Windows renditions. You will need a Windows 10 installation medium such as an installation CD in order to perform this method. If you don't have an installation CD, you can create an installation USB drive by doing the following:  Plug an 8 gigabyte (or larger) USB drive into your computer. Open the Windows 10 download page. Click Download tool now  Double-click the downloaded tool. Follow the on-screen prompts to install the tool to your flash drive. Place the installation CD in the disk drive, or insert the USB flash drive into one of the computer's USB ports. .

Your BIOS key will depend on the manufacturer of your computer's motherboard, but common keys include the function keys (e.g., F2), the Esc key, and the Del key. If you don't know which key to press or hold, consult your computer's BIOS documentation by searching for your computer's model, the word \"bios\", and the word \"key\". Again, this will vary depending on your computer's BIOS; you'll usually open the Boot or Advanced tab, use the arrow keys to select your CD drive or USB drive, and press the + key to move the drive up to the top of the list. As with any BIOS problems, you should consult your BIOS documentation online if you have any trouble. Press the \"Save and Exit\" key as specified by your BIOS legend, then confirm by pressing another key if prompted.

I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you\u2019ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one\u2019s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth  manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores.

Ensure each sentence contains fewer than 37 tokens:\n\nThis paper introduces LatinCy, a set of trained general purpose Latin-language \u201ccore\u201d pipelines for use with the spaCy natural language processing framework (Honnibal and Montani, 2023). These are end-to-end pipelines for taking plaintext Latin as input for basic NLP processing including sentence segmentation, word tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition (NER). Three models have so far been trained, named according to spaCy conventions: la_core_web_sm, la_core_web_md, and la_core_web_lg. To clarify, \u2018la\u2019 refers to the language code for Latin, \u2018core\u2019 refers to a pipeline that includes all of the components named above, including speci\ufb01cally NER; \u2018web\u2019 refers to the nature of the training data, speci\ufb01cally that the model is trained primarily on Universal Dependency treebanks; and \u2018sm\u2019, \u2018md\u2019, and \u2018lg\u2019 refer to the \u201csize\u201d\u2014i.e., small, medium, or large\u2014of the models, with \u2018md\u2019 and \u2018lg\u2019 models being larger because they include subword vectors that describe the vocabulary while \u2018sm\u2019 models do not. \u2018tagger\u2019, \u2018morphologizer\u2019, \u2018trainThe current default pipeline consists of the following spaCy components: able_lemmatizer\u2019 (i.e. the EditTreeLemmatizer based on M\u00fcller et al., 2015),2 \u2018parser\u2019, and \u2018ner\u2019.3 Sentence segmentation is trained as part of the dependency parsing task. There are also components included for orthographical regularization (i.e. overwriting the spaCy norm_ attribute); this is done because the \u2018trainable_lemmatizer\u2019 can use norm_ for backoff instead of text. Splitting of the enclitic -que is currently handled by customizing the spaCy tokenizer such that all words that end with -que other than a provided list of exceptions (e.g. neque, atque, quoque, etc.; the full list is provided in the que_exceptions list in \ufb01le scripts/functions.py) are split from their token. The spaCy \u2018tok2vec\u2019 listener is shared by all of the components at training except for \u2018ner\u2019 which is trained with a separate \u2018tok2vec\u2019 \u2217With annotation contributions from Nora Bernhardt (ner), Tim Geelhaar (tagger, morphologizer, parser, ner), Vincent Koch (ner).3The best \u201cdescription\u201d of the pipeline, that is the documentation of all data sources, model parameters, etc. is the project.yml \ufb01le included in the LatinCy project at  The general \u201cdesign\u201d of the spaCy pipeline with reference to the components named here can be found at              \fBURNS | LATINCY - MAY 9, 2023 listener.4 In addition, \ufb02oret vectors (50,000 or 200,000 subword vectors with a length of 300 respectively for the \u2018md\u2019 and \u2018lg\u2019 models) are trained separately and loaded into the pipeline when the training process is initialized and then used in the further training of downstream components. The motivation for training this pipeline is as follows: 1. these are the \ufb01rst end-to-end trained pipelines for Latin in the spaCy \u201cuniverse,\u201d building on contributions from the  language in spaCy,5 and as such make available to Latin-language researchers the work of a large NLP framework and development community; 2. these models make use of the full array of Universal Dependencies treebank annotations available for Latin by synthesizing \ufb01ve separate treebanks with slightly different annotations schemes into one dataset, totaling roughly 54,000 sentences with just under 1M tagged tokens; and 3. since the components are trained and evaluated using the spaCy project infrastructure, accuracy (or precision/recall as appropriate) scores can be reported for all components, and for certain components like morphological tagging and dependency parsing, these scores can be reported at feature level, signi\ufb01cantly aiding with error analysis.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 37 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.2, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(36, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"spaCy\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 10], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Latin\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ensure that each sentence contains fewer than 17 words:\n\nOnce you have a clear picture of all your debts, the next step is to work out how much you can afford to pay each month. Draw up a detailed budget that covers all of your income and expenses and determine what money you have available for your debts. Think about how you can reduce your expenses by making savings and cutting back on non-essentials. If possible, consider how you might also raise your income.  Once you have your budget, you should be able to come up with a realistic and attainable figure that you can set aside each month just for paying off your debts. Join this up to your list of prioritized debts and see how much you can afford to pay. Now you need to contact your creditors to talk about possible ways to restructure and reorganize your debts. If you are able to give them detailed information about how much you are able to pay each month, it may be possible to renegotiate the terms of your loans. For example, you may be able to agree a new repayment plan that reduces the monthly amount you pay, but spreads the payments out over an extended period. It\u2019s important that you are able to reach an agreement with your most troublesome creditors. The others should be easier to pay off once you take care of these creditors and reduce your payments to them. . If you have been unable to negotiate new repayment plans, or all of the information is overwhelming you, be sure to make an appointment with a non-profit credit counseling or debt advice organization. There are number of charities and other non-profits that specialize in giving free and impartial advice to people who find themselves in financial difficulty. Here you will receive advice on what steps to take, and how to deal with creditors.  There is lots of useful information online, but always try to get a face-to-face meeting. Lots of universities, military bases, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extensive service have non-profit credit counseling schemes. Local credit unions, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureaux, and housing authorities may be able to help. Make sure you are visiting a reputable organization with a strong track record. Non-profit doesn\u2019t always mean free. In some cases, a credit counsellor may suggest you enroll in a debt management plan. The counsellor is most likely to suggest this if you are unable to repay your debts. The plans typically involve you paying money to the counseling organization, who then pay it to your various unsecured debts.  Think carefully about this and be sure you have talked it through with your creditors. Only do this if an advisor has looked through your finances thoroughly. In most instances, a counsellor should be able to give you advice on budgeting and managing your debts without resorting to one of these plans. . Debt settlement programs involve working with a company (normally a for-profit company) to pay off principal balances to your creditors, with lump sums that are less than what is owed. Creditors will only do this if they believe it's a better outcome than trying to chase you for payments in the future. The company will make the payment, but you will be required to pay a specific amount of money into a savings account for a long time. This can help pay off your debts, but it can be a risky approach.  If you consider this, be sure you that can make the monthly payments indefinitely. Bear in mind your creditors are under no obligation to come to terms with the debt settlement company. Debt settlement companies generally encourage you to pay them rather than your creditors. As a result, your credit score will suffer and there can be other consequences. If your debts are not being paid you may be incurring extra fees and charges that you wouldn\u2019t if you were paying the creditor directly. There are numerous scams related to debt settlement, and not all companies will live up to their promises. Before you sign-up, do plenty of research on the company and always get free impartial advice for a non-profit credit counseling organization. . You may be able to lower the cost of your debt by consolidating it against a new line of credit, such as by re-mortgaging your home. These plans will generally use your home as collateral, so if your home is not at risk from your debts, think carefully about whether you want to put it on the line.  Be wary of consolidation schemes with variable rates. What might be cheaper to start with can become more expensive if the rate is pushed up. . If your debts are completely unworkable and you cannot find a way forward, it might be time to consider filing for bankruptcy. This is a major decision with long-lasting consequences that should not be taken lightly. Bankruptcy can make it very difficult to access credit or buy a home in the future.  Those filing for bankruptcy can file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler and faster to file and results in the elimination of most debts, but some filers may not qualify for this type of bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy should be considered as a last resort in most cases. In some circumstances, bankruptcy can give a person a fresh start. Talk through your options in detail with a credit counsellor and an attorney specializing in bankruptcy and credit problems before taking any decisions.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

In particular, the \ufb01eld of legal visualization has a long historical tradition of using visualizations to explain complex legal relationships and scenarios [1]. The core advantage of visualization is that it provides a graphical representation of something that would otherwise be di\ufb03cult for humans to understand. It is thus a form of complexity reduction, aiming at human comprehension and understanding. This can include large data sets that are easier for humans to understand in visual formats, and where certain properties of the data can only be discovered through visual means. Examples range from visual representations of business data, as commonly used in statistics and data analytics, to visualizations of medical data, e.g., to discover features in the human body, or visualizations of sensor data and their extrapolations to create animated weather maps [6]. Visualization further includes visual representations of knowledge for facilitating human communication, cf. [3,4]. In contrast to visualizations of data that are typically generated through algorithms, such visualizations are created and curated by humans manually [5]. Based on the intended purpose of the visualization, they may be based on a formal or semi-formal language \u2013 as typically used in conceptual modeling [9] \u2013 or may consist of ad-hoc compositions of shapes and drawings, e.g., as typically found in the area of infographics, cf.[2] or in structural legal visualization [14].             \f2 Fill and Mu\ufb00 The creation of this latter type of visualization typically requires not only a deep understanding of the domain and scenario to be represented but also skills for using appropriate tools and procedures [1,5]. These tools can range from drawing tools that allow the creation of arbitrary shapes or the reuse and adaptation of existing shapes, over modeling tools that require the use of prede\ufb01ned shapes and concepts, to sophisticated dedicated visualization tools, e.g., for the creation of 3D representations cf. [7]. While standard drawing tools are fairly easy to operate, modeling and specialized visualization tools often require signi\ufb01cant training to use them e\ufb00ectively. With the recent emergence of highly capable large language models, this last aspect can be addressed in previously unimagined ways, especially through creating computer code in various languages [11]. At their core, large language models are trained on very large amounts of text so that they represent a probabilistic model of word sequences [10]. Each word in the vocabulary of the language model is thus assigned a probability that can follow a given input sequence or an already generated sequence of words. Recent scienti\ufb01c and technological advances have made it possible to increase the training sets for such language models to hundreds of billions of parameters [13]. In November 2022, the company OpenAI made one large language model publicly accessible in the form of a dialogue system called ChatGPT and a corresponding API. The underlying GPT language models have been trained on more than 175 billion parameters and are not only able to generate text sequences in di\ufb00erent styles based on input sequences in the form of prompts but can also output code of programming languages and may soon be able to process multimodal data as well, e.g. images. Recently, the application of these large language models has been explored in a variety of domains to see how they can support the creation of text and code in various ways \u2013 e.g., [8]. Therefore, in the following, we report on some experiments we have conducted to create visualizations using prompts to a large language model in the form of GPT-4 . The goal of these experiments was to explore which types of visualizations may be generated in this way, with the particular goal of supporting at some point structural legal visualizations as used in legal informatics. Thereby we aim to contribute to the discussion on how novel types of arti\ufb01cial intelligence can support visualizations from a metaperspective [12]. The approach we use in the following targets the generation of visualizations based on graphical primitives, i.e., using vector graphics or programming code. This is in contrast to other approaches of using large language models, for generating pixel graphics as done for example by Dall-E. We structure the experiments according to the following categories: a) twodimensional visualizations, b) simple three-dimensional visualizations for a webbased environment, and c) complex three-dimensional visualizations for dedicated 3D modeling editors. Thereby, the \ufb01rst category aims at structural legal visualizations as typically generated today manually, e.g., in PowerPoint, whereas the second and the third category target real three-dimensional visualizations, which are today being generated for example using programming libraries such as three.js or the open-source 3D modeling toolkit Blender . The latter requires \fVisualization in the Era of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence advanced knowledge of either programming or specialized 3D modeling software. Generating visualizations for these environments without this knowledge seemed to us the most interesting use case.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 55 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 55}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(55, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence has more than seven words:\n\nThe well screen is the most important part of the well: it attaches to the bottom of the long PVC well pipe and lets the water in, filtering out debris and sand. The well screen has hundreds of small slits that filter out the debris, keeping your water clean. There will be a 4 inch (10.2 cm) space between the bottom of the 8 inch (20.3\u00a0cm) PVC pipe where there are no slits. This 4 inches (10.2\u00a0cm) gap will connect to the the PVC pipe. Mark three slits circumferentially around the 8 inch (20.3\u00a0cm) pipe.  The slits should be approximately 7 inches (17.8\u00a0cm) long and should be equally spaced apart.  The gap between each slit should be approximately 1.4 inches (3.5 cm). Make sure your slit does not connect all the way around the pipe. Leave a small gap between the ends of each slit. Draw three more slits two inches above the first set of slits. Again, make sure that the slits don\u2019t wrap all the way around the screen, but instead have a gap of two inches between ends of the slits. Keep drawing sets of three slits, all two inches apart. You can stop when the the screen reaches 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) in length. The length of six feet will allow a great deal of water to come through the pipe and be filtered. Using a hacksaw, cut out the slits according to the lines you drew. Carefully saw each line, making sure not to cut all the way through the pipe. Continue sawing until you have made a slit for every line. You\u2019ll need to find a PVC cap to the end of the well screen. Make sure that it fits the well screen snugly. Any leakage here, and your well will not filter properly. The primer will help hold the end cap onto the screen and prevent any leakages. Apply the primer liberally to avoid any leaks. Once you\u2019ve applied the primer to the end cap, turn to the well screen. Apply the same amount of primer around the mating portion of the well screen. The double portion of primer will help both pieces to hold together. You\u2019ll have to work quickly here, as the cement dries quickly. Paint over the exact area that you primed. Again, work quickly. Hold the end cap onto the screen for fifteen seconds to allow the cement to dry. Let the pipe rest for several minutes to ensure that the glue has dried completely. The foot valve is the mechanism that allows water to be drawn in but does not allow water to escape back out.  There are two-foot valves used in this well.  The first one is at the bottom of the six-inch PVC pipe and the second one is at the bottom of the 4 inch (10.2\u00a0cm) PVC.  These mechanisms will allow the water to be drawn into the 6 inch (15.2\u00a0cm) pipe  on the upstroke of the well, and it will push water through the 4 inch (10.2\u00a0cm) pipe  on the down stroke, when water is pushed out of the well.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

Know that many of the greatest music videos are great for completely different reasons. Some are visually inventive, some have a razor-shop focus, and others just fit the music perfectly. By understanding what made certain music videos particularly influential, you may have a better perspective for how to make your own unforgettable video. Many of the most beloved music videos of all time tell stories that are funny, shocking, tragic, or triumphant. A truly great story stays in the viewer's head for weeks, months, or even years.  Arguably one of the most famous videos of all time, John Landis' video for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" video tells a classic story. This video also greatly overruns the length of the actual song. It works here, but use caution - too little music and too much video can make for a boring combination. The video for Radiohead's \"Just\" directed by Jamie Thraves also tells a great story, albeit one with a drastically different tone. This video uses excellently-cast squares and an open-to-interpretation ending to skewer the inanity of white-collar life - a great match for Thom Yorke's spiteful lyrics. Music videos are great places to showcase visual innovation and trickery. The video can be an opportunity to employ abstract visuals, unique effects, or animation that visually compliments the song's audio. The visuals don't even have to \"make sense\" in a traditional sense. As long as they're striking and accompany the song well, they can leave a lasting impression.  Steve Barron's video for A-ha's smash hit \"Take on Me\" features a romantic story playing out in a combination of live action and sketchbook-style rotoscope animation. This stylistic choice perfectly matches the song's whimsical, smitten tone and makes for an unforgettable visual style. The video for The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army\" (made by directing duo Alex and Martin) employs visual trickery to give the illusion of one four minute long continuously-zooming shot. Combined with the striking lighting choices, this creates a tremendously disorienting effect that gives the video a great dark atmosphere. See also: Muse's \"Stockholm Syndrome,\" Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing.\" Cultural references are frequently used in music videos - sometimes, the entire video is a loving homage or a scathing lampoon of the material being referenced. With a good sense of humor, the results can be classic. If the artists don't mind a little self-deprecation, all the better - people love musicians who are humble enough to poke fun at themselves.  Hype William's video for 2Pac and Dr. Dre's \"California Love\" is a parody of the Mad Max series of films. The parody serves two purposes -  besides being just plain funny, it also suggests that early 1990s California is a lawless, do-or-die playground where only the strongest survive, similar to the post-apocalyptic wasteland depicted in the Mad Max films. An even funnier parody music video is the video for the Beastie Boys' \"Sabotage,\" directed by Spike Jonze. Having the Beastie Boys portray over-the-top caricatures of gritty 1970s TV cops, Jonze makes an unforgettable, hilarious video that somehow fits the music perfectly. It can be entertaining simply to throw as much money as possible at the screen. Shoot in an exotic locale. Plan enormous choreographed dance sequences. Hire supermodels. Great music videos can be pure spectacle, plain and simple.  Hype William's video for Jay Z's \"Big Pimpin'\" is a classic example of music video as spectacle. There's very little in the way of narrative or story - it's mostly just Jay Z and friends having a good time on a massive yacht, partying at a tropical villa, and throwing money to a crowd, all while surrounded by beautiful women. As a display of wealth and braggadocio, it's very effective. Lady Gaga is another artist famous for her elaborate music videos. Steven Klein's video for her \"Alejandro\" depicts a bizarre, sexually-charged militaristic dystopia, complete with insane (but appropriate) sets and costumes. It's a striking, extravagant production. Conversely, many great music videos follow a \"less is more\" philosophy. Minimalist music videos allow the viewer to focus on the action (and its emotional relationship with the music) with no other distractions. A minimal video is also a great choice for directors on a limited budget.  Saam's video for The XX's \"Islands\" uses repetitive shots of a short, tightly-choreographed dance to great effect. By making very subtle changes to the dancer's moves each time the shot repeats, we're able to see hints of a tragic romance unfolding. The gradualness of the change makes the final shot all the more shocking. OK GO's early videos used imaginative choreography to make instantly memorable viewing experiences on a miniscule budgets. Their video for \"Here it goes again\" (directed by Trish Sie and the band) is great example of a well-done video shot for almost nothing. The video is done in one static shot in an undecorated room, the only props being eight treadmills. Because of the strength of the choreography and the memorability of the concept, the video was a big viral hit when it was released in 2006.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 35th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [35]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(800, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([35], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

Each sentence should contain more than 8 words:\n\nCraigslist and eBay are a few of the most common places to list high-end furniture, although there are other sites you can use as well. Chairish is a site specifically for listing high-end furniture, but you could also try sites like OfferUp, Bonanza, Facebook Marketplace, ArtDeco, 1dibs, or Oodle. These sites all allow you to include an advertisement and accompanying photos. They are accessible to buyers outside of your community.  Shipping costs can be an issue when selling outside of your community. Be aware of the costs and make sure the buyer is willing to pay to come retrieve the furniture. Many listing sites ask you to pay a small fee, such as $1, to advertise. Depending on the service, you may also have to offer a commission, which is usually a percentage of the final sales price. Some apps to check out include LetGo, Chairish, Apartment Therapy Bazar, 5Miles, and Everything But The House. These apps are convenient and often very easy to use. Many of them don\u2019t ask for a listing fee when you first post your advertisement. Be sure to read the fine print. Some apps take a percentage commission of the final sales price. It can often be a high amount, like 25%. Look for a consignment shop that carries high-end and vintage furniture. You will have to transport the furniture to the shop, but you can then leave it on display there. Then, you wait until someone buys the furniture. It\u2019s a great way to advertise high-end pieces in your community without having to do a lot of extra legwork.  Consignment shops take a commission once your item sells. The fee can be anywhere from 25% to over 50%, so discuss the arrangement with the shop before doing business with them. Some shops force you to discount or take back items if they don\u2019t sell within a certain time period. Consignment shops are often small and have limited space, which means your furniture is more visible. However, the shop may not get a lot of foot traffic or customers interested in costly furniture. If you\u2019re interested in selling the furniture on your own, ask your local newspaper publisher about posting a classified ad. The ad gives you some room to post a brief description of the furniture and possibly a picture as well. Include your phone number or email address so buyers know how to reach you. If your ad is clear and an interested buyer happens to see it, then you can sell the furniture without having to travel very far.  One downside of newspapers is that not everyone reads them. The only people that see your ad will be readers inside your community, and they may not be interested in what you\u2019re selling. Discuss the cost you have to pay to run the ad. It can get expensive. Newspapers often charge a fixed cost, such as $5 to $100 per line. Many newspaper outlets also post classified ads on their websites, although you may need to pay a separate fee for it. Search online for stores and traveling dealers in your area. Send them a description and photos of your furniture. If they like what they see, they may buy it from you right away. Most dealers also handle shipping on their own, too.  Dealers are resellers, so don\u2019t expect to get the best deal. Since they are in business, they are often trustworthy, reliable buyers, however.  Completing a sale depends on what the dealer is looking for and the quality of the furniture. If it all works out, then you can make a quick sale with a professional. If a dealer isn\u2019t interested in your furniture, they may be able to give you a free estimate on what they think it is actually worth. If you have something too precious to sell through the traditional ways. Such as a family heirloom, let a professional handle it. Take it to a shop or auction house that has a history of  selling antique furniture. These places often have their own evaluators you can rely on to come up with a sales price. Many of them will buy the furniture from you or  at least link you to potential customers.  Get information on how to sell antiques by getting in touch with antique associations. Search for national antique organizations online to find their websites. Antiques can still be sold through online listings and other routes, but they are more difficult to price and advertise accurately. You may need a professional opinion to figure out where the furniture came from, for example.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

It is likely that finding a different way to respond in tough situations will be high on your list of priorities.  Once you have identified your triggers, you can work on finding more positive ways to respond to those triggers. For example, maybe you typically raise your voice when your child complains about eating broccoli for dinner. Next time this happens, actively choose to keep your tone neutral. Maybe you tend to burst into tears when you are criticized. When you feel the tears coming, choose to take deep breaths and voice your frustrations calmly instead. Small changes can make a big impact on your emotional health. Try altering your living space to make it a more calming place. For example, try buying some fresh flowers to put in your living room. Look at them and think calming thoughts when you are feeling stressed.  If your negative emotions stem from feeling out of control, try organizing your work space. Getting rid of clutter can make you feel on top of things. Try adding more light. Natural and artificial light can help ease anxiety. So open your curtains and add some higher wattage bulbs to your lamps. Staying physically fit can have positive benefits for your emotional health. Exercise can boost your mood and decrease stress, which can help you retain control of your emotions. Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.  Choose an activity that you enjoy. If you've always wanted to learn to play tennis, take lessons or join a league for beginners. Add more B12 to your diet. This vitamin has been shown to improve emotional well being. Look for salmon, chicken, and lean beef to add to your dinners. There are multiple mental health benefits that come from writing in a journal. Writing down your experiences and your reactions can help you learn to identify your emotional triggers. It can also help you to see patterns in your reactions, which will allow you to think about how to modify those behaviors. Journaling can also reduce stress and anxiety.  Make it a point to write in your journal each day. Set aside at least five minutes to write down anything that's on your mind. At the end of each week, read through your recent entries. Reflect on anything significant that has happened in your life. Managing your emotions does not mean that you need to ignore or repress your feelings. It is normal and healthy to feel a wide array of emotions. Learn to express those feelings in healthy ways. Talking about your emotions is very productive.  Try talking to friends or family. It is a good idea to let your loved ones know how you are feeling. Try saying, \"I've been really stressed out lately. Do you have time to talk things through with me?\" Be calm and rational while you are talking. It's fine to express anger or frustration, but do so without yelling. Hormones can cause significant mood swings, and are also related to many emotions, such as sadness, irritability, and even depression. Women typically deal with a lot of hormone-related emotions during pregnancy, menopause, and menstruation. Track your emotions to figure out if they are related to times when your hormones are in flux.  To help deal with these intense emotions, there are several things you can do to try to regulate your mood. Eat healthy foods and get some exercise. The endorphins will help. Talk to your doctor about medication. For example, if you're dealing with severe PMS, medication might be helpful. If you are prone to unexpected tears, that can have a negative impact on your day to day life. Often, unpredictable crying is related to hormones. But it is also a symptom that you are experiencing anxiety. Crying is not necessarily a bad thing. It is your body's way of releasing emotions.  When you cry, don't force yourself to stop. Trying to block your emotions like that can take a lot of unnecessary energy. Instead, try to prevent the tears from ever starting. Take positive steps to manage your emotions, such as journaling and meditation.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": [], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

The appearance of new model architectures, including the emergence of generative transformers and pre-trained language models (PLMs), has brought along with it widespread usage and attention. Still, most of these models were trained on large amounts of web content, and while they excel at tasks in a general-purpose setting, there is still a performance gap when it comes to domain-specific challenges. One of these challenging domains is biomedicine, which centers around the study of the human body, diseases, drugs, and treatments. Biomedical text is often characterized as highly complex because of its advanced terminology, which frequently includes names of chemical compounds, long-spanning relations, and other jargon not commonly used in everyday language. For NLP models trained on general corpora to work well in the biomedical domain, researchers have turned to transfer learning methods and domain adaption. The most common approach to domain adaptation is to continue the initial general pre-training of language models with data from domain-specific medical corpora. Examples of models adapted in this way are BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) and SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), which drew the additional training data from biomedical and computer science research abstracts. Dropping the mixed-domain approach from previous frameworks, models like PubMedBERT (Gu et al., 2020) and BioLinkBERT (Yasunaga et al., 2022) were instead trained solely on PubMed research articles, with BioLinkBERT even leveraging links (citations) to other research articles. While domain fine-tuning of whole PLMs has proven to increase the performance on downstream biomedical NLP tasks, additional pre-training can often be resource-intensive and infeasible for smaller research groups and situations where computing power A promising research direction has is limited. emerged in the form of knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) (Hu et al., 2023). It refers 22 c e D2 ] L C . s c [ v83.12 : v i X r a             \fto any set of methods that try to incorporate external knowledge into language models, usually by injecting it into the model\u2019s input, architecture, or output. In a sea of knowledge-enhancement methods, an especially interesting one is the utilization of adapters. Broadly speaking, adapters are small bottleneck feed-forward layers inserted within each layer of a transformer-based language model (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020b). The small amount of additional parameters allows for the injection of new data or knowledge without requiring the whole model to be fine-tuned. Adapters plugged on top of large language models will often only have around 1% of the number of training parameters compared to the transformer. The transformer model\u2019s learned parameters (weights) are frozen and left unchanged, and only the adapter is fine-tuned. Other than being lightweight on resources, this approach also helps avoid the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where language models forget their existing knowledge from the pre-training corpora when they are fine-tuned on a new, smaller corpus (Colon-Hernandez et al., 2021). This paper specifically focuses on using adapters to inject structured biomedical knowledge from large knowledge graphs into PLMs. We provide an overview of existing adapter approaches for the biomedical domain, as well as existing biomedical language models. We perform extensive experiments to test the performance of knowledgeenhanced, adapter-based biomedical language models on a number of representative biomedical classification tasks (document classification, question answering, natural language inference). We show that the model performance is improved in several instances on downstream tasks and provide a deeper look into the resulting change in model predictions. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that the OntoChem ontology (Irmer et al., 2013), which has not been used for knowledge enhancement yet, is a viable alternative to other prominent knowledge sources.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter.  She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her.  She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree.  My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it.  Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc.  She also couldn't start the \"early college\" program until she was a junior (11th grade).  She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.  The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.   I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job.  We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the \"home\" phone.  The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate.  My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better.  I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving.  She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left.  I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is.  I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation.  She's 18 and can make her own choices, but we wished she had not made this choice.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

Within various applications, an unresolved query pertains to the extent of LLMs\u2019 capability to grasp human mental health conditions expressed in natural language. Mental ill-health issues pose a substantial challenge to individuals and communities on a global scale. Recent data indicates that over 20% of adults are likely to encounter at least one mental disorder during their lifetime, with 5.6% experiencing severe psychotic disorders that severely impact their functioning. Moreover, depression and anxiety alone contribute to an annual global economic productivity loss of approximately $1 trillion. Over the last ten years, there has been an abundance of research in the \ufb01elds of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science aimed at identifying mental ill-health issues using online text data, such as social media content [9, 18]. However, a majority of these investigations have concentrated on constructing specialised machine learning (ML) models for speci\ufb01c tasks like stress detection [17] or depression prediction [14, 33]. Even conventional pre-trained language models like BERT [12] necessitate \ufb01ne-tuning for particular downstream tasks.

On another front, a separate line of research has explored the use of chatbots in mental health services [5, 22]. Most chatbots operate on rule-based systems and could bene\ufb01t from more advanced models that enhance their capabilities [1]. Despite the growing body of research aimed at empowering AI for mental ill-health, it is crucial to recognise that existing techniques may inadvertently introduce biases and even provide harmful advice to users [6, 29]. Anxiety disorders are marked by an excessive sense of fear and worry, accompanied by related behavioral disturbances. These symptoms are severe enough to cause signi\ufb01cant distress or impair daily functioning. There are various types of anxiety disorders, including generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worrying), panic disorder (de\ufb01ned by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (involving excessive fear and apprehension in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (involving intense fear or anxiety regarding separation from emotionally signi\ufb01cant individuals), and others. E\ufb00ective psychological interventions are available, and in certain cases, depending on factors like age and the severity of the condition, medication may also be considered as a potential treatment option Depression stands apart from the usual shifts in mood and brief emotional reactions to daily challenges. During a depressive episode, an individual consistently experiences a low mood (such as feeling sad, irritable, or empty) or a diminished capacity to experience pleasure or interest in activities, enduring for the majority of the day, virtually every day, for a minimum of two weeks. Additionally, several other symptoms manifest, which may encompass di\ufb03culties in concentration, overwhelming feelings of guilt or diminished self-esteem, a sense of hopelessness about the future, contemplations of death or suicide, disrupted sleep patterns, alterations in appetite or body weight, and heightened fatigue or reduced energy levels. It\u2019s crucial to note that individuals with depression face an elevated risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. Fortunately, e\ufb00ective psychological therapies are available, and depending on factors like age and the severity of the condition, medication may also be considered as a viable treatment option.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 13 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 13}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(14, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(13, \"more than\")"]}}}

I come visit once a year, but I don't usually get to spend this much time here, which was great!  I grew up here in a semi rural community, but my parents got a great job offer in NY so we moved to Albany.  We still have a cabin up here out in the woods not too far from where I grew up so that's where I stay when I (or we!) come visit.  I spent the first few days of the trip just getting settled in with my dog Sasha, and we did a lot of hiking around.   I love nature and even seeing the same places when I come, they are always still just as beautiful. I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.  It was so much fun and I got to get a bunch of recipes to bring back home with me!  Plus, I got to meet a chef from a few towns over who has their own show on the Food Network.  For someone who loves cooking as much as me, I felt like I was meeting an idol almost! Other than that, we spent a lot of time out in nature, bringing Sasha with us to our favorite lake to swim in from when we were kids.  My friends and I even spent a few days hiking even deeper into nature and pitching tents for a mini camping trip.  It was definitely one of my favorite visits out here!  I was able to completely get back in tune with myself and let nature and people boost me back up when I was down.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 0.8, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

It started early in the day, and my parents came by and picked me up at my house.  Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm.  We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin.  She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around.  But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard.  It was just so sad, all of it.  Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain.  After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade.  Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point.  All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly.  We then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks.  It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason.  I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home.  I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt.  I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again.  But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3636363636363636, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"cousin\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"cousin\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"was\", 8, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"and\", 4, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"to\", 7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(10, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}}}

Wash and condition your hair as usual, then towel it dry in preparation for the haircut.  Layering short hair is more difficult to do by yourself than layering long hair, since you're creating each layer individually. Keep in mind that this method will only work for pixie style cuts. Take a look at your hair and decide exactly where you want the layers to be and how short you want them before you begin. Plan to cut your hair in a well-lit bathroom with at least two mirrors, so you can check your progress often and see the back of your head as well. Short hair must be divided into sections before layering. Use a comb to carefully divide your hair in the following way:  Make a \"top box\" section by creating a part on either side of the crown of the head where the head begins to round. The two parts create a section of hair in the middle of the head. Comb this \"top box\" forward and comb the hair to either side straight down, so that the sections are clearly delineated. It may also help to twist your hair before clipping it. Divide the rest into two parts: the first part extends from the crown of your head to your forehead, and the second part extends from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck. Lift the hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Your fingers should be perpendicular to your forehead. Use a sharp scissors to trim the tips of the hair extending from between your fingers. Let the hair fall, then use the comb to lift another section of hair in the section of hair that is immediately behind the front section. Then comb a bit of the hair from the first section into this new section. This will serve as a guide for the correct length. Hold it at a 90-degree angle from your head between your forefinger and middle finger, then trim the tips to the exact same length as the first section of hair you trimmed.  Continue trimming hair from the top until you've trimmed the entire front and back sections of the box. Use a spray bottle filled with water to keep the hair damp as you go. If your hair gets too wet, then dry it off with a towel. Pay careful attention to which sections of hair have been cut and which still need to be cut. When you're working with short hair, cutting the same section twice can make a big difference. All hair should be trimmed to the same length. When the cut is finished, it will be layered in appearance. Once the entire top box has been trimmed, change the part of your hair by combing it to the sides so that you have a part straight down the middle. Working from the front of your hair around the side to the back, lift sections of hair straight from the top of your head and hold them between your fingers. Hold your hair so that your fingers are perpendicular to your forehead. Use the scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section. Repeat until you've trimmed the top layer of hair on the side of your head, then do the other side. If you see a spot that is uneven, or you want shorter layers, use the scissors to carefully trim your hair a small section at a time. At this point, you can also refine the edges. Comb your hair into the style you plan to wear it in and trim the edges. Check around the ears and the back of the hairline especially.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

It was sometime in July/August, and it was the first time I had tried something truly magical. This magical experience I had was due to me eating a few grams of Psilocybin mushrooms. It was sometime at night, and I had just gotten everything I needed to try them. I planned on making a tea out of the mushrooms, I read somewhere on Reddit that if you boil water and let the mushrooms sit in the hot water all of the bad alkaloids that cause nausea wont be there and that the effects wont be as strong. Anyways, after brewing the tea I decided that I should sit down and start enjoying my freshly brewed magical tea. About halfway through the cup, I felt butterflies building up in my stomach. I think it was just my nerves getting to me, but I was starting to feel pretty anxious about the whole situation. I did not know what I should be feeling or what to even expect. I decided to lay down, and not finish the tea. This is when the effects begin to really kick in, it had been about 45 minutes since I made the tea. It's hard to describe how I physically felt, but I think the best way to describe it is that I had absolutely no energy to get up. I was glued to my bed. Instantly I started to get very introspective, thinking about literally everything and anything. I was thinking about all the times I got angry, all the times someone did something for me, I started thinking about all my family members. It truly was a remarkable experience, as it showed me that all the problems I thought I had weren't really problems at all. I felt as I had complete control of the world around me, I felt connected to everything and all of my everyday stresses vanished just like that. Nothing mattered at that moment, this overwhelming experience of freedom brought tears to my eyes. I could not stop crying these tears of joy, I don't think I ever felt so free and happy then I have at that moment. I remember telling myself to right down all of these feelings because I did not want to forget about this moment. The next day I felt an overwhelming glow about myself, and I just wanted to help everyone around me. This experience for me was very memorable, and brought a lot happiness into my life.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()  # Evaluate overall text quality", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")  # Check each sentence's length"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

Getting an animal is a long term commitment. Animals live for years and years. Ask yourself some questions to see if you truly want to be a pet owner.  Do you have other extra-curricular activities (e.g. sports, music, dance class, etc.) that take up your time? Are you willing to wake up early to care for your animal before you go to school? How will you fit your pet into your current schedule? Are you willing to use your allowance or chore money to help pay for your pet? There are so many options when it comes to pets. Some pets require very little maintenance while others will take up quite a bit of time. Also consider how much space you have in your home for a pet and how your pet may affect your family. Is anyone allergic to the pet you may want? Is a family member afraid of a pet you may want?  The lowest maintenance pets (e.g. fish, snakes, lizards, and turtles) require about 15 minutes a day for feeding and one hour a week to clean the tank. These animals will be fun to watch, but they will not interact and play with you like other animals. Low maintenance pets (cats, rabbits, canaries, parakeets, guinea pigs, gerbils, hamsters, mice, and rats) require about 15 to 30 minutes of daily maintenance and weekly cage and litter box cleaning.  Dogs are medium maintenance pets that require one or two hours of care every day. They will require much more attention than cats, and you will need to walk them every day. The highest maintenance pets (horses, parrots, pot belly pigs) require a lot of time and space, and your parents will probably not agree to this. Once you have chosen a pet, learn as much as you can about the animal. Figure out the supplies you will need to take care of your pet.  How will your pet get along with other people? How will your pet behave? How much will it cost to take care of your pet?  How long will your pet live? Why do you want a pet? How much will your pet cost? What type of food your pet will need? What type of accommodations (e.g. tank, aquarium, cage, kennel) will your pet need? How you will help pay for the pet? What time will you wake up in the morning to feed your pet before school? Who will take care of your pet when your family goes on vacation? What type of exercise will your pet need? How big will your pet be when it is full size? When does your pet like to sleep? What areas can you take care of the pet yourself (e.g. walking the dog, feeding your pet)? What areas will you need some help with (e.g. giving your dog a bath, cleaning the cage, taking your pet to the veterinarian)?  If you have any friends that have a pet, talk to them about their responsibilities.  They can give you some good advice. The more information you know, the more your can impress your parents. Take notes as you learn all of this information. You can use your notes when you talk to your parents. Read about your potential pet in books, magazines, and the internet.

However, there are still many works that explore multiple strategies to improve the PLMs. Firstly, in specialized domains (i.e biomedical domain), many works demonstrate that using indomain text (i.e. PubMed and MIMIC for biomedical domain) can further improve downstream tasks \u2217 Work done at Alibaba DAMO Academy. \u2020 Corresponding author. Figure 1: An example of the biomedical sentence. Two entities \u201cglycerin\u201d and \u201cin\ufb02ammation\u201d are linked to C0017861 (1,2,3-Propanetriol) and C0011603 (dermatitis) respectively with a relation triplet (C0017861, may_prevent, C0011603) in UMLS. over general-domain PLMs (Lee et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2019; Alsentzer et al., 2019). Secondly, unlike training language models (LMs) with unlabeled text, many works explore training the model with structural knowledge (i.e. triplets and facts) for better language understanding (Zhang et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019; F\u00e9vry et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). In this work, we propose to combine the above two strategies for a better Knowledge enhanced Biomedical pretrained Language Model (KeBioLM). As an applied discipline that needs a lot of facts and evidence, the biomedical and clinical \ufb01elds have accumulated data and knowledge from a very early age (Ashburner et al., 2000; Stearns et al., 2001). One of the most representative work is Uni\ufb01ed Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004) that contains more than 4M entities with their synonyms and de\ufb01nes over 900 kinds of relations. Figure 1 shows an example. There are two entities \u201cglycerin\u201d and \u201cin\ufb02ammation\u201d that can be linked to C0017861 (1,2,3-Propanetriol) and C0011603 (dermatitis) respectively with a may_prevent relation in UMLS. As the most important facts in biomedical text, entities and relations can provide information for better text understanding (Xu et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020). To this end, we propose to improve biomedical PLMs with explicit knowledge modeling. Firstly, \u2026 treated with glycerinshow reduced inflammationafter 2 hours.C0011603 dermatitisC00178611,2,3-PropanetriolR176722500(C0017861, may_prevent, C0011603)            \fwe process the PubMed text to link entities to the knowledge base. We apply an entity recognition and linking tool ScispaCy (Neumann et al., 2019) to annotate 660M entities in 3.5M documents. Secondly, we implement a knowledge enhanced language model based on F\u00e9vry et al. (2020), which performs a text-only encoding and a text-entity fusion encoding. Text-only encoding is responsible for bridging text and entities. Text-entity fusion encoding fuses information from tokens and knowledge from entities. Finally, two objectives as entity extraction and linking are added to learn better entity representations. To be noticed, we initialize the entity embeddings with TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), which leverages not only entity but also relation information of the knowledge graph. We conduct experiments on the named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) tasks in the BLURB benchmark dataset. Results show that our KeBioLM outperforms the previous work with average scores of 87.1 and 81.2 on 5 NER datasets and 3 RE datasets respectively. Furthermore, our KeBioLM also achieves better performance in a probing task that requires models to \ufb01ll the masked entity in UMLS triplets. We summary our contributions as follows1: \u2022 We propose KeBioLM, a biomedical pretrained language model that explicitly incorporates knowledge from UMLS. \u2022 We conduct experiments on 5 NER datasets and 3 RE datasets. Results demonstrate that our KeBioLM achieves the best performance on both NER and RE tasks. \u2022 We collect a cloze-style probing dataset from UMLS relation triplets.

While most clothing manufacturers size skirts according to the same basic measurements, you still try the skirt on before you buy it.  If a pencil skirt is too large, it may add too much extra volume to your midsection. As a result, your waist will look wider and your figure may take on a boxy appearance. On the other hand, if a pencil skirt is too small, it may create bulges along your thighs, stomach, and rear. Super tight pencil skirts are also difficult to walk in. If you aren't sure where to start, try to find a pencil skirt with a waistband that sits roughly 2 inches (5 cm) above your navel. The material should fit around the widest part of your hips without looking stretched, and it should taper off and end somewhere beneath that point instead of ending directly on it. The length of the lower hemline and the height of the waistband will have slightly different effects on your overall appearance. While there are some general guidelines to consider, the best way to determine the right length and height for your figure will be to try on a variety of styles and gauge which one you prefer while standing in front of the mirror.  If you want to make yourself look taller or leaner, consider choosing a high-waisted style with a shorter hemline. By shifting the skirt further up along your body, you create the illusion of longer legs and a narrower waist. On the other hand, taller women may wish to consider pencil skirts that drop down to the knee or just beneath it. You can still show off your naturally long legs with a short skirt, but the added length can have a sophisticated effect when you're tall enough to pull it off. Nowadays, pencil skirts are made from a wide range of fabrics and prints. You can stick with classic choices if you want a relatively versatile skirt, but if you're feeling bold, picking something more unique can be a great way to add more pizazz to your outfit.  It's hard to go wrong with a black pencil skirt, so if you want only one easy-to-style piece in your wardrobe, stick with black. Vibrant colors and prints can be somewhat difficult to dress up, but in comparison, a black pencil skirt can make the switch from professional to casual to seductive much more readily. Also note the way that color, pattern, and texture affect your overall appearance. The more you stray from the standard black skirt, the more attention you'll draw to your lower half. The pencil skirt works well for most body types, but if you're notably curvy on the bottom, you might want to be a little more careful about the way you wear it. Since pencil skirts hug your thighs, they tends to accentuate your lower curves, and the resulting oomph in sex appeal may not be appropriate for all occasions.  To draw attention away from your lower half, stick with pencil skirts in dark, solid colors and pair them with patterned or textured tops. The visually stimulating top should draw the eye upward, drawing it away from your bottom half in the process. Pay attention to the hemline, as well. Make sure that the hemline does not land at the widest part of your thighs; if it does land there, you'll only make the added volume look even more significant than usual. Skirts that hit just above or directly below the knees are usually a better choice since these are the narrowest points of your leg. If you've tried on a standard pencil skirt and don't like the way it fits your curves, don't give up. Try on another pencil skirt with a slit removed or darts sewn into it. Either option will change the shape of the skirt in a subtle way, and it may become more appealing to you.  To make your hips and legs look leaner, consider wearing a pencil skirt with two vertical darts sewn into the front. The darts draw in your waist and encourage the eye to look up-and-down, rather than side-to-side. To accommodate a narrow waist and wider thighs, you might consider a pencil skirt with a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 8 cm) slit in the hemline of the middle backside. The slit gives your legs more room to move around while keeping the waistband cinched in where it needs to be in order to maintain a proper fit. Slits can also give the skirt a sultrier, more flirtatious ambiance.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"waist\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}}}

It may sound morbid, but being aware of your impermanence can actually enhance your life. Live every minute as if it\u2019s your last, focusing your energy on enjoying whatever that might be and always looking for the positive.  Check in occasionally by asking yourself, \u201cIf I died right now, would I be happy or proud of how I spent my last moments?\u201d If the answer is no, find a way to improve your current situation to change that to a yes. For instance, if you\u2019re in a boring meeting at work, instead of dwelling on how long it\u2019s dragging on, appreciate the softness of your favorite sweater on your back or impress your boss by offering a new idea. The next time you walk by a homeless person on the street, for example, pause and try to see things through their eyes. Not only will you better understand the situation and get a new perspective on it, you\u2019ll also be able to react more sensitively and compassionately.  For example, maybe you're walking fast because it's freezing outside and you only have a thin coat on. But then you realize the homeless person has no coat, and nowhere to go. Imagine if that was you. Since you stopped to considered their point of view, you might give them some of your loose change to buy a warm meal instead of just passing by. This practice spreads more love and peace, rather than indifference and hurt. Mindfulness is one of the most important aspects of Buddhism. To incorporate it into your own life, try a technique known as savoring. Pay attention to the sights, sounds, textures, or tastes of whatever is happening right now. For example, if you\u2019re eating a brownie, notice the chewiness or the way the chocolate chips melt on your tongue.  Avoid dwelling on the past or living for the future. If you notice those thoughts pop up, like when you start worrying about your big date tonight, redirect your attention to the current moment instead. A good way to bring yourself back to the present is by taking a few deep breaths and focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. In Buddhism, the middle path states that you should never be at one extreme or another. Instead, you should live your life in the middle, striking a healthy balance between the two. Work this principle into all aspects of your life, like work, family time, and even the food you eat.  For example, don\u2019t spend all of your time working, but don\u2019t laze around 24/7 either. The middle path would be spending 8 hours a day at the office, and then coming home to relax or be with your loved ones. This applies to how you treat others, too. While you don\u2019t want to be rude to someone, for instance, you also don\u2019t want to be fake. The balance would be to be honest about your feelings while still being compassionate.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_count_check(len(text.split('.')), \"less than\")", "Note: For simplicity, the provided text is assumed to be stored in a variable named `text`."], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

If you\u2019re selling your grandparents\u2019 old dining room table, it might be useful to find out what kind of table it is (style, material, and, if possible, who made it). You can find this kind of information in general reference books on antiques.  Most libraries have a section on guides for antiques and collectibles.  Once you identify your item and get a ballpark value, it will be easier for you to figure out a good price for that item. Look for items similar to the one you want to sell. Compare the condition of the items for sale to the condition of the one you have. Check for any differences in style, material, or maker. Then check how much the dealer is trying to sell the item for.  You might even want to talk to the dealer\u2014ask about why they priced the item the way they did. Beware: While antiques dealers can be helpful in determining a ballpark price for your item, you should ever ask them (or allow them) to appraise your item unless you know for sure that you will not sell your item to them. It is considered a conflict of interest for a dealer to appraise an item they intend to buy. If a dealer offers to buy an item after valuing it for you, say no. Ebay, Amazon, and Craigslist are all useful sites for finding out how much people are willing to pay for items like yours. On Ebay, you can search for similar items which have recently been sold. This will help you to see what people are actually willing to pay for items like yours.  Keep in mind that these sites are highly competitive, so their prices tend to be on the low side. If you want to get the most money possible for your item, online auction sites aren\u2019t the best gauge. Price guides list different types of antiques or collectibles along with a range of prices you can expect to get for them. Kovel\u2019s is considered to be the best online guide for antiques and collectibles. You can get a free subscription or pay a yearly fee for its premium services. Appraisers can give you several different kinds of price values, depending on how (or if) you want to sell your item.   Auction Value \u2013 The auction value is the amount that your item would be expected to sell for at an auction. Very rare or valuable items are often sold at auction because people are willing to spend more. However, items that are less rare or valuable tend to go for less at auction than they would at retail price, because there is not much demand for them. Retail Value \u2013 Retail value is the amount of money your item would sell for in an antique store. If your item is not rare and you don\u2019t expect its value to be high, the retail value is likely to be higher than the auction value. Remember, though, that an antique dealer will not buy your item from you at full retail value; if they did, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make a profit. Insurance Value \u2013 If you decide that you don\u2019t want to sell your item, an appraiser can also assess its insurance value. This is the amount of money that you would need to replace your item in a \u201creasonable amount of time\u201d if it is destroyed or stolen. This is useful is your item is especially valuable. Many people think that their item will be worth more if they clean it up before having it appraised. However, \u201crestoring\u201d or otherwise altering an item without talking to an expert first often has the effect of lowering the value of the item\u2014sometimes by a lot. Keep your item just the way it is\u2014flaws and all.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(60, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence contains more than 11 words:\n\nA contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that stipulates  the terms of the agreement. Modern organizations maintain a large inventory of con-  tracts and other legal documents. A typical large Fortune organization manages up-to  40,000 active contracts at any point in time (Pery and Simon 2019). A substantial  amount of time and cost is involved in manually reviewing and analyzing these con-  tracts for due diligence and risk analysis. According to a study (Dodd 2018), more  than 50% of contract review tasks e.g. clause identification and classification (Zhao  2019) are repetitive in nature requiring legal domain knowledge and understanding.  However, due to the extremely large scale and ever-increasing volume of contracts  that an organization must deal with, manually segregating paragraphs in these con-  tracts to derive any actionable information is a monumental task for any law firm or  legal department. Therefore automatic categorization and classification of legal clauses  and provisions using natural language processing and artificial intelligence has been  of great academic as well as commercial interest (Katz et al. 2023, DALE 2019).  The primary research interest for this paper is the classification of provisions found  in contracts into topics. This involves two important considerations: A) Sophisticated  neural network classification methods require a large set of labeled curated data which  can  be  a  difficult  and  costly  exercise,  B)  The  classifier  models  trained  on  general  language corpus are not efficient for the legal classification task, because legal texts  have a specialized language and distinctive vocabulary with peculiar expressions and  terms that do not commonly occur in day-to-day spoken or written language.  The focus of this research is the usage of transfer learning (Zhuang et al. 2019)  techniques  because  they  look  promising  to  address  the  two  challenges  above.  The  central tenet in these techniques is to first train a general-purpose language model to  serve as a base model by training on a very large general corpus but without using any  task-specific labeled dataset. At this step, the base model only encodes the semantic  information as lower-order features. Then, fine-tune (Dodge et al. 2020) and customize  this foundational model for the classification task using relatively fewer labeled data  points  and weights learned in the base  model.  By following this approach, higher-  order feature representations are fine-tuned making them more efficient at the specific  task by utilizing the lower-order general features learned in the original base model  without having to explicitly re-create them. This avoids the need to re-train a large  model using a large dataset from the beginning for the specific task.  The aim of this research is to examine the applicability of fine-tuning a pre-trained  large language model for legal domain classification task. In support of that, the main  topic  of  provision  in  a  contract  will  be  predicted.  The  corpus  of  contracts  used  is  obtained from public domain filings in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  curated in Legal General Language Understanding Evaluation (LexGLUE) (Chalkidis  et al.  2021)  which uses LEDGAR dataset (Tuggener et al.  2020). Each label in the  dataset  represents  the  single  most  important  topic  (subject)  in  the  corresponding  contract provision (refer Table 1 for sample data format). The provisions and their  count are given in appendix Table A.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 11 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 11}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(11, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}}}

The output should contain fewer than 460 tokens:\n\nThe notes you take in class will help you know what to study between classes. Don\u2019t try to write down everything that the teacher says. Instead, pay careful attention to any information your teacher suggests is likely to be included on tests.  Having help with taking notes is an accommodation many schools are able to make for learning disabilities. If you need this accommodation, check with your school\u2019s office of academic accessibility. It may help you to record your lecture classes. Most smartphones have built-in voice recorders, or you can download a recording app. Recording a lecture will allow you to go back and hear it again. If there\u2019s anything in your notes that confuses you, or which you feel might be wrong, check with your teacher or a classmate to ensure you have the right information.  If you wait too long to read your notes, you may not remember enough of the class to make sense of them It may help you to rewrite your notes in a more condensed way. This tests your comprehension of the material in a way that ensures you\u2019ve really grasped the meaning. You\u2019ll need to have a place where you can study that is free of disruptions and interruptions. This might be in your bedroom, in a library, or in another room. You\u2019ll have to be honest with yourself about what your own needs are.  For example, if you\u2019re distracted by looking out the window, move your work area so that you can\u2019t see outside from where you work. Wear headphones over your ears if you need to avoid being distracted by ambient sound. Some people benefit from using a fan facing the wall to generate white noise. This prevents distraction from random sounds. You could also download a free \u201cwhite noise\u201d app on your phone. Sitting and studying for unlimited lengths of time will lead to boredom and distractibility. Instead, study in blocks, interrupted by short breaks where you stand up and move around away from your study area.  You might set a timer to help you remember to take a break after 45-60 minutes. Then, set another timer to remind you to return to your desk. Usually a break of 10 minutes is a good length. When you\u2019re studying your notes, refer not only to the textbooks you\u2019ve been given, but use internet searches to supplement your understanding. Sometimes your subject matter will be better explained by another source. For example, Khan Academy is a good source for many scientific topics.  You can use these sources to supplement your work. Using visual information, graphics, videos or other media can help you understand the lectures. If the resources that you find provide information that contradicts the science you\u2019ve learned in class, make careful notes and ask your teacher. This might provide the basis for additional discussion. Science might seem like a lot of facts, but each fact was found out by someone\u2019s trying to answer the question \u201cWhy?\u201d Learning how things fit together will help you make sense of the facts you\u2019re learning in science class.  For example, if you imagine a cannon firing, you may be able to better remember Newton\u2019s Third Law: \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d But what does this mean? A cannon, being larger than a cannonball, pushes the ball a great distance when it\u2019s fired. But at the same time, the ball exerts its own force on the cannon, so the cannon will will also be pushed back few inches in the opposite direction. This is an example Newton\u2019s Third Law. A lot of science is done using the metric system, since this is the system most commonly used internationally. The metric system is based on units of 10, and is used to measure length, mass and time.  For instance, 10 millimeters make a centimeter, 10 centimeters make a decimeter, 10 decimeters make a meter, which is the base unit of length in the metric system. The system that most Americans use is called the Imperial system, but even American scientists use the metric system at work. It can be helpful to learn basic conversions from Imperial to metric, particularly for chemistry. When you think you understand the material, try to explain it to someone else. Teaching another person is the best way of knowing for sure whether or not you really understand the material you\u2019ve been studying. If you can test your knowledge on a friend or family member, this will help you assess your own knowledge.  It can help to imagine the kinds of questions you might ask if you were the professor. Try finding new examples for the information you\u2019ve learned based in your own experience or knowledge. Each person has slightly different techniques for effective studying. Your own study skills might include using (and creating) flash cards, or making stories out of the information you\u2019ve been given. You might write your own songs to help you remember salient facts and details.  If you study best with a group, form a study group with others in your class. Be careful not to use this group for socializing, but as an effective learning time. If you study best alone, make sure that you\u2019re able to remain focused on your work without getting distracted by other activities.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"study\", 5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"accommodation\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"study\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

If you get paid twice a month, you may have two days a month that you pay bills. Whatever system you use, be consistent. Bills are often late because people do not have a time set aside to pay them.  Mark your calendar or create a reminder on your phone to help you remember to pay your bills. You may need to adjust your payment day for holidays or vacation times. Your bills may fluctuate each month. At the beginning of the month, create a checklist of the bills you are expecting. Have a place on the checklist to mark if the bill was received and when the bill was paid. The list should be kept in the area where you pay your bills.  If you are expecting a bill but do not receive it, check with the company to see if there was an error. You do not want to pay a bill late because you were not on top of things. Your list can be handwritten or electronic. Do what works best for you. Automated bill pay is good for expenses that do not change every month such as phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Find out on which dates the money will be deducted and write them down so that you are sure there is enough money in your account to cover it.  Automated payment is not good for bills that may change every month like your credit card bill. You can throw off your budget if the bill is higher than you expected. If you are using automatic payments for your credit card bill, make sure that you are at least paying the minimum amount.  Some companies charge for automatic bill pay. Make sure that it is a free service.  When you create your online account, sign up to receive notifications about your upcoming bills. These can remind you to check your account to make sure the funds are there and to pay your bill on time. Set up an online account for each of your bills. You can even connect the account to one of your bank accounts so you do not have to enter your payment information each month. Paying online saves you time and resources. You will not have to buy envelopes, stamps, or checks if you use this method.  An online account also gives you immediate access to other helpful information about your account such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Online payments are also processed faster than checks. There will be less lag time between your payment and your bank account balance. If you are sending a check in the mail, be sure that the check arrives by the due date or at least is post dated before the due date. If you can, pay your bill as soon as it arrives to avoid forgetting about it or mailing it in too late.  Make sure you are always stocked with the necessary bill-paying supplies such as envelopes, stamps, and checks. Keep in mind that the post office is closed on Sundays and Federal holidays.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}}}

Your revised version should contain more than 12 sentences:\n\nWith the rapid development of LLMs applying to numerous areas, notably in dialogue systems (Bae et al., 2022) and creative writings (Swanson et al., 2021), these models have transcended their role as mere tools for daily convenience. LLMs have become increasingly prevalent in various socialinfluencing domains such as education (Kasneci et al., 2023; AlAfnan et al., 2023) and the technology industry (Dong et al., 2023), playing a more and more important role in social influence. The existence of bias is harmful under such a context, as the social influence of LLMs can further promote the underlying legal and ethical implications (Weidinger et al., 2021; Deshpande et al., 2023). Many previous studies have identified gender bias in NLP models (Gupta et al., 2022; Sheng \u2217Equally contributed et al., 2019). For gender bias in LLMs, previous works usually focus on certain tasks in the English context and use single-dimensional evaluation methods for gender bias (Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023), neglecting the fact that LLMs generally receive different types of instructions for different utilizing circumstances, where the gender bias can be reflected in different aspects. Considering the diverse language backgrounds of LLM users and the strong capabilities in multilingual reasoning of the LLMs themselves(Lai et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023; Rathje et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), it is important to emphasize the various language features and cultural influences that affect how gender bias occurs in different languages. Different languages may have different degrees of gender bias in LLM generations: such an understanding is essential for acknowledging and mitigating these biases in LLMs, guaranteeing they are more equitable and culturally aware in the wide range of applications. To address the above limitations for gender bias evaluation in LLMs, our study emphasizes the substantial role of conversations undertaken by LLMs and explores gender bias in different dimensions. In particular, we present three quantitative evaluation measurements for gender bias in LLMs, which can reveal three-dimensional aspects of gender bias. Based on the proposed measurements, we conduct experiments in six different languages using a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3/4 (Brown et al., 2020). allowing us to compare the levels and nuances of gender bias across these languages. Our approaches facilitate a comprehensive analysis of both lexicon and sentiment aspects of gender bias across different languages, providing insights into the fact that diverse instructions may influence gender biases in LLM generations in different ways.

Latest estimations from UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2023) indicates around 213 million adults (population over 15 years old) who could not read or write, in 2022, across the sub-Saharan African region, including nearly 49 million young people (15-24 years old). In Senegal, ANSD (2021) reports an overall illiteracy rate of 48,2%, reaching 62,7% in rural area. Literacy rate relates to the official language of a country. In Senegal, the official language is French but is seldom spoken by the population in their daily lives. Senegalese people primarily use their native languages or Wolof, as a vehicular language, to communicate. World Bank (2021) reports that nearly 65% of Senegalese who do not use the Internet are hindered by a lack of digital literacy. This is partly due to the limited (if not none at all) availability of content in the language they speak. Currently, there is a severe lack of accessible content for those who do not speak the official languages in Africa. The development of technologies and tools for the most widely spoken languages would enable a larger proportion of the Senegalese people to use smartphones and applications, and to access content that is still unavailable today. Research work as Medhi et al. (2011) and the success of WhatsApp voice communication show that the development of conversational voice services in local languages is a credible and promising way of making services more accessible. Aker (2011) also suggested in that time that combining a voice-based approach with information that can be accessed through answers to common farmer questions would overcome literacy challenges due to the common texting modes. To make progress in this area, robust speech recognition systems need to be designed for these languages. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies tend to be mature in the languages most commonly found on the Web, there is still very few solutions dedicated to African languages. In Senegal, Wolof, Sereer, Pulaar, Joola, Malink\u00e9 and Sonink\u00e9 languages are recognised as national languages in the Constitution, but none of these six languages seriously benefit from the major technological advances generated by AI. Efforts have been made to develop speech resources and technologies in Wolof (see section 4) but no resources are available for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) in Pulaar nor Sereer. Yet, Wolof, Pulaar and Sereer languages are spoken in more than two-thirds of Senegal country (Leclerc, 2023). Agriculture is the primary source of income for 2 billion people around the world (Zelezny-Green et al., 2018). In Senegal, 55% of the population is involved in the agricultural value chain, including family farming, livestock breeding, and fishing. 22 r p A ] L C . s c [ v91.02 : v i X r a             \fToday, digital technologies are assisting farmers in expanding their businesses by enabling them to position themselves on marketplaces, providing them with information on commodity prices, and granting them access to suitable financial services. Nonetheless, such solutions are still not appropriate for farmers, particularly given the prevalence of written communication and the use of a language they do not speak, when interacting with these interfaces. With the intention of speech solutions development, this dataset is intended to fill the gap in this area. Paper contribution. This paper presents the dataset created from speech data produced and annotated during the Kallaama project, as well as textual data gathered from the web, with the aim of developing voice-based solutions in local languages.

In robotics and planning, LLMs are adopted to guide agents through structured environments [Huang et al., 2022, Andreas, 2022]. In theory-of-mind reasoning, LLMs are required to maintain and update local and global graphs that reflect the beliefs of different characters [Adhikari et al., 2020, Ammanabrolu and Riedl, 2021]. In structured commonsense reasoning, LLMs are expected to generate graph-based action plans to achieve objectives with diversified prerequisites [Tandon et al., 2019, Madaan et al., 2022]. In multi-hop question answering, LLMs implicitly find connections and paths among a vast network of entities and concepts [Creswell et al., 2023]. Together these works demonstrate that LLMs are widely adopted for tasks with implicit graphical structures while achieving preliminary success. However, one underlying yet crucial question remains underexplored: Can LLMs reason with graphs? More concretely, are LLMs capable of mapping textual descriptions of graphs and structures to grounded conceptual spaces and solving \u2217equal contribution 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).             \fgraph algorithm problems explicitly with natural language? The answer to this question has profound implications for large language model applications with implicit graphs and structures, the reasoning ability of LLMs in advanced and graph-based settings, and more. To this end, we propose the Natural Language Graph (NLGraph) benchmark, a comprehensive testbed of graph and structured reasoning designed for language models and in natural language. NLGraph contains a total of 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from intuitively simple tasks such as connectivity, cycle, and shortest path to more complex problems such as topological sort, maximum flow, bipartite graph matching, Hamilton path, and simulating graph neural networks. We control for problem difficulty through generated graph size, network sparsity, numeric range, and more, presenting easy, medium, and hard subsets in each distinct graph reasoning task to enable fine-grained analysis. In addition to using exact match accuracy as a standard metric, we also design several partial credit solutions for various graph reasoning tasks. With the NLGraph benchmark, we evaluate whether various large language models [Brown et al., 2020, Ouyang et al., 2022, Bubeck et al., 2023] could perform graph-based reasoning and whether different prompting techniques [Brown et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2022, Kojima et al., 2022, Zhou et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023] improve the graph reasoning abilities of large language models. Extensive experiments on the NLGraph benchmark demonstrate that: 1. LLMs do possess preliminary graph reasoning abilities. Specifically, large language models demonstrate an impressive level of performance that is 37.33% to 57.82% above the random baseline on simple graph reasoning tasks such as connectivity, cycle, and shortest path. With chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs could generate intermediate steps that are sound and accurate while further improving task performance. 2. The benefit of advanced prompting methods diminishes with complex problems. On one hand, chain-of-thought [Wei et al., 2022], least-to-most [Zhou et al., 2023], and self-consistency [Wang et al., 2023] successfully enhance the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs on simple tasks such as cycle and shortest path. On the other hand, these approaches are mostly ineffective, even counterproductive in certain settings, on more complex graph reasoning problems such as topological sort and Hamilton path. 3. Learning from examples did not happen on complex graph reasoning problems. While in-context learning is widely credited for teaching LLMs to learn from examples [Brown et al., 2020], its benefit on more advanced graph reasoning tasks is unclear: Few-shot in-context learning fails to improve over zero-shot prompting across multiple tasks, while increasing the number of exemplars may even be counterproductive for tasks such as Hamilton path. 4. LLMs are (un)surprisingly brittle to spurious correlations in problem settings. We find that in two special cases in the connectivity task (chain and clique), LLMs perform much worse than the general dataset with a performance drop of more than 40% across various settings. This indicates that large language models are implicitly relying on certain spurious correlations (for example, use node mention frequency to determine connectivity), falling short of performing robust structured reasoning in graph-based contexts. To improve large language models as better graph reasoners, we propose two instruction-based prompting approaches to better elicit the graph reasoning abilities of large language models. Builda-Graph prompting encourages LLMs to map the textual descriptions of graphs and structures to grounded conceptual spaces [Patel and Pavlick, 2022] before tackling the specific problem through a one-sentence instruction, while Algorithmic prompting instructs LLMs to revisit the algorithmic steps for a given task before learning from in-context exemplars. Experiments demonstrate that builda-graph and algorithmic prompting successfully empower LLMs to better tackle graph reasoning problems, resulting in 3.07% to 16.85% performance gains across multiple tasks, while the most complicated graph reasoning problems remain an open research question.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"graph.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"graph\", 15, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"large language models\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(40, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"graph\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 6, 8, 12], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"graph\", 10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence contains more than 11 words:\n\nThe most common way to lengthen your lashes without mascara is to apply false eyelashes. These come in all shapes and sizes, from full strips that fit your entire lashline to individual clusters that you can place exactly where you want a little extra length.  Try full strip false lashes if you\u2019re feeling especially dramatic. These will give you a major length boost. Individual lashes work best if you want a more natural, subtle look. You may need to cut or trim strip lashes to fit your eye shape. Always test a pair before trying to put them on. To secure the lashes to your lid, apply lash glue to the false lash band or cluster. Let the glue sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If it feels slightly tacky, you\u2019re doing it right. Set the lashes just above your natural lash line, starting at the outer corner and pressing inward to secure them.  When you\u2019re applying your lashes, set your mirror below you and tilt your chin downward so you can place the lashes at the right angle. After all, titled or lopsided lashes are not ideal. After you\u2019ve applied the lashes to your eye, let them sit for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that the glue has bonded with your skin. You don\u2019t want one of these guys falling off mid-day! To remove the lashes at the end of the day, simply peel up one of the edges and gently pull the lashes off. You may need to use eye makeup remover to remove any glue residue from your lashes or skin. Straight lashes can look shorter and sparser. That\u2019s where the trusty eyelash curler comes in. Curling your lashes helps lift the them so they look long and fluttery. Take your eyelash curler, and curl your lashes along their entire length for the longest look.  You can purchase an eyelash curler at drugstores, beauty supply stores, or any store that sells cosmetics. Start with the eyelash curler at the base of your lashes, and hold it closed for approximately 3 seconds. Next, move the curler to the center of your lashes and hold it closed for another 3 seconds. Finally, place the curler at the end of your lashes and hold it closed for a final 3 seconds. Ta-da! Instantly longer lashes. If you don\u2019t have an eyelash curler, a clean toothbrush is a surprisingly good stand-in.  Run the brush under hot water and then dry it lightly with a clean towel. Next, run the brush through your lashes, starting at the base and holding it at the tips for several seconds to create the curl. Eyeliner, mascara's partner in crime, can actually be used alone to lengthen lashes! Instead of applying the liner to your lid, trace it right along the base of your lashes. Next, gently pull up on your eyelid to expose the underside of your lashline, also known as the tightline, and apply liner there as well to make your lashes appear thicker and longer.  Use a dark eyeliner so it blends in with your lashes. Black is usually the best option, but if your lashes are light, you might want to pick a brown liner. For the liner at the base of your lashes, you have a ton of options: try pencil, powder, liquid, or cream eyeliner. For the tightline, use a pencil or cream liner.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 11 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 11}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(10, \"change\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}}}

Even though safety issues began to happen more and more, our supervisor simply kept piling on more work. Her boss told her it wasn't important and we could skip doing it, but my supervisor wanted to impress everyone and be \"number 1\" so she ignored all advice. Whispers began behind her back, the other pharmacists began to worry about their licenses but the pressure just kept mounting. I found the wrong pills in a bottle on the shelf and my supervisor got mad at me, even though I had not filled from that bottle at all that week. Nothing was ever mentioned again and I began to lie awake at 3 in the morning wondering if the wrong medication had gone out unnoticed before or since. This income was so important to my family, the job was so important to my self-worth but I knew if anything happened I would be liable no matter who was truly at fault. My job had been toxic to begin with, my supervisor was abusive and infamous in our company for being a nasty person. My coworkers trained me by yelling at me and then arguing and ranting with each other in Spanish about me. But I persisted, I did not want to let them win. Every morning I hoped I would get in a car wreck serious enough that I could not work for the foreseeable future. I snapped at my husband, I snapped at my child. Every moment not spent at work was filled with crushing dread that I would have to go back in a few hours. My marriage suffered greatly, my self-esteem was trashed. Yet still I kept on. But that one little tablet of Tramadol was enough to snap me out of it. I was terrified, someone with over a decade of experience had mistakenly put a controlled substance into a bottle of blood pressure medication. And no one caught it. The counts of the controlled medication done every day weren't off? That seemed odd to me, every tablet of those is so tightly accounted for that someone either counted wrong or they noticed but didn't have time to deal with the paperwork so they brushed it aside. How many times had it happened before? Why was I being blamed? These questions ate at me and ate at me until I realized I was killing myself for a job that would throw me under the bus even knowing criminal charges could be brought against me when I didn't do anything wrong.

Avoid using the term 'blood':\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know when you might be contacted about a potential match\u2014it might be in a few months, a few years, or never at all. No matter what, it\u2019s crucial to keep your registry contact information current so that if you do match with a patient, you can move forward with the process as soon as possible. To see if you\u2019re a match, a doctor will compare the proteins in your blood cells with those of their patient. The more similar they are, the better the chance of the patient\u2019s body accepting the transplant. When you get contacted as a potential match for a patient, respond promptly as instructed. The donation is voluntary, so just because you get matched doesn\u2019t mean you have to go through with it. Think carefully before making this decision. Backing out may have a serious effect on the patient\u2019s health, but you may have legitimate reasons for doing so, such as a health issue or being unable to take time off to recover.  If you decide to donate, you\u2019ll sign a consent form. No doctors or registry officials will pressure you to sign this form\u2014it\u2019s completely your own decision. If you decide not to donate, tell the registry and doctors right away so they can start searching for another donor. After being matched, you\u2019ll go through a physical examination and possibly more tests, including another cheek swab or blood sample. If you\u2019re chosen as the best match for the patient, you\u2019ll attend an information session, where you\u2019ll learn more about the exact donation process and possible risks and side effects. You\u2019ll also sign the consent form at this session.  At the information session, you\u2019ll also learn whether you\u2019ll undergo a bone marrow or PBSC donation. You can ask the doctors about the patient as well. Most information is confidential, but centers are typically able to tell you their age, gender, and disease. If you give a traditional bone marrow donation, you\u2019ll be in a hospital outpatient facility all day and sometimes overnight. You\u2019ll be under general anesthesia for about 2 hours. During the donation, you\u2019ll be lying on your stomach and the doctors will use hollow needles to withdraw liquid marrow from small 2 small incisions in your pelvic bone.  General anesthesia is used for about 96% of bone marrow donations, but some facilities use regional anesthesia, either spinal or epidural. The procedure removes only a small fraction of your total bone marrow, and your marrow will naturally replenish itself within a few weeks of the donation. Before a PBSC donation, you\u2019ll be injected with filgrastim, a medicine that increases the amount of stem cells in your blood. You\u2019ll receive these injections on each of the 5 days before the donation. During the donation, you\u2019ll have a needle put into each of your arms. Blood will be removed from one arm, then passed through a blood cell separator machine to collect the necessary cells. The remaining blood will be returned to your body through your other arm.  The cells removed by the blood separator machine are blood-forming cells, platelets, and some white blood cells. Plasma and red blood cells go back into your body. Your first filgrastim injections will be given at a donor center or clinic. On days 2-4, you can get your injections at your home or workplace. You\u2019ll get the last injection at the center, followed by the donation itself. The donation can take up to 8 hours.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'blood'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "blood", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.2666666666666667, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666, "gpt4o": 0.8, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"match\")", "detect_keyword(\"donation\")", "detect_keyword(\"blood\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"match\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"donation\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 7, 10], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"match\", 5, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"donation\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"donation\", 5, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["detect_keyword()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"blood\", \"remove\")"]}}}

However, it is important to treat the people in your workplace with respect and professionalism. Throwing fits or getting in arguments with people you don't like is unprofessional and will slow down the team's work significantly. Sometimes, you may want to rush to get certain tasks done. However, in a team environment, that can lead to mistakes or an ineffective work process because you're not taking the time to work with other people or communicate what you're getting done. Make sure to spend the proper amount of time to do your work well while working with others at the same time. When you're not in a team environment, your job description may be fairly well defined. In a team environment, you may need to jump in to help in areas that aren't exactly in your job description because someone else needs the help. Being willing to help out makes the group work more efficiently and builds good will.  In addition, jumping in when you see a need looks good to your boss, earning you brownie points, which is never a bad thing. Also, you may find yourself needing help in the future, and if you've given help in the past, others will be more willing to offer you help when you need it. If you're excited, you'll get others excited. When you're working together, that excitement can lead to better results, as you're all motivated to do your best on the projects you're working on. On the other hand, if you constantly criticize or talk down about a project, that can be catching, too, and it can bring a project down. For example, don't start out the day by saying, \"I wish we didn't have to work through these ridiculous budget reports.\" Instead, you could say, \"I know a budget report isn't everyone's cup of tea, but just think, going through these budget reports means we get the money we need to do the projects we love.\" Remember that no two people are alike, and that each team player has strengths, weaknesses, likes, and dislikes. Knowing what makes your teammates tick is necessary to develop strong and productive working relationships, where you complement each other rather than work against each other. Spend some time each day talking to your coworkers. Ask how they are and really listen to their answers. Let them talk about their home lives if they feel like talking about them. It can be tempting to take credit for other people's work. While it creates animosity no matter what environment you're in, it's especially detrimental in a team environment, as it can create major rifts. On the other hand, offering up who deserves credit for each part of the project goes a long way to building bridges. Offering up who deserves credit will make others feel appreciated, and feeling appreciated for hard work can help create the feeling of being on the same team.\n", "tool_test_result":

My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

Try to work out at least three times a week for thirty or more minutes. This is the minimum amount of time needed to start impacting your body and seeing results. Working out doesn't only tone and thin your body, it's also a great stress reliever.   If you can't make it to the gym or a fitness class, there are things you can do on your own as a workout. Take a run or a brisk walk around your neighborhood. You can also buy free-weights at stores like Walmart or Dicks Sporting Goods if you want to lift weights. Stretch before a workout. Stretching is essential to making sure you don't injure yourself before a workout. Stretching also increases your blood flow and circulation, which is energizing and can improve your mood. If you enjoy stretch-related exercise, try out a yoga or Pilates class. This can mean things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or biking instead of driving. Doing this won't take any time out of your schedule, but it will make you happier and healthier. These are good ways to keep up your fitness in the busy weeks before your wedding. As you are starting your fitness routine, make an effort to eat healthier. Choose 1% milk as opposed to 3%. If you are eating a sandwich, choose a whole grain bread. Try to find the healthy version of everyday things that you eat. These changes make it easier to transition to a healthy lifestyle without giving up your normal diet.  Recreating your favorite foods at home is a great way to do this. If you crave pizza, buy a pizza crust from the grocery store along with sauce, low-fat cheese and some veggie toppings. This will satisfy your craving in a healthy way. Try to make half your plate at meal times contain either fruit or vegetables. They are essential in giving you the vitamins, minerals and fiber you need for great health. Keep fresh vegetables like baby carrots or sugar snap peas around for snacking. Snacking on veggies is filling and good for your body. Food is awesome, but if you're not hungry anymore then it's time to stop. Getting into this habit will help you maintain or even lose weight. Slow down how fast you eat, and really consider whether you are still hungry. Sometimes you get full before you mentally realize it, so eating more slowly will help you be in touch more with your body and hunger. You want to glow on the day of your wedding, not be worried about blemishes. In the months before your wedding, be sure to wash your face twice a day with a facial cleanser.   To wash your face, splash lukewarm water on your face. Use your fingertips to apply cleanser gently to your face in circular motions. Rinse with lukewarm water again and pat dry with a clean towel.   If you wear makeup, be sure to remove makeup before with a gentle makeup remover before washing your face. Just washing your face will not remove all makeup. Do not wash your face more than twice a day. Washing to much can irritate or dry your skin. Try to wash your face only at the beginning and end of the day, or after sweating. Moisturizing protects and revitalizes skin. Even if you are prone to oily skin, it's important to moisturize daily. It's best to moisturize at the beginning and end of the day after washing your face. Taking a bath or shower actually dries your skin, so any time you get wet it is a good idea to moisturize afterwards.  You can buy moisturizer that is made for your skin type. If you know that you have especially oily, dry or sensitive skin, get a moisturizer specifically formulated for your skin type. Not only can wearing sunscreen prevent skin cancer, it can also keep your skin looking healthy and great. Take care when you are in the sun in the months leading up to your wedding by applying sunscreen thirty minutes before going out in the sun to all exposed body parts. Make sure that the SPF is at least 15 or above. Pay close attention to covering your face, which is a sensitive area. Reapply every few hours that you are in the sun according to the directions on the bottle.

This was about my relationship with my ex and how it turned out poorly and led to some bad self doubt. My ex and I started out fantastically as friends and unfortunately that is where it should have stayed. We began well enough, having stayed up night after night chatting with one another and gaming with one another. We were young, love struck and despite some flawed starts of jealousy from both sides, we did well at first. Then after the relationship became official it became a nightmare to even survive within. This was after my previous relationship where I royally messed up in the emotional support department and let somebody nice down, so I was more than prepared to endure here as a, I guess, makeup for the last. However, that kindness was taken advantage of and I was manipulated, lost friends and stopped talking to people I once contacted daily. Likewise my personal hobbies deteriorated and I was more or less told to spend every waking moment with them. I cannot personally state all the things that went on, or the ways I was kept in the relationship because I feel like those are too personal, but needless to say I basically hated it. I had to wait for her to get bored of me, find another person to obsess over and let her dump me for things to be peaceful. So I exited that as a mess, both relationship wise and mentally. Hated them in general for the longest time and wondered if I did things wrong. Kind of hard to believe the person I met turned out to be like that, so I blamed myself for it at times. However, over time I learned that it wasn't my fault, I let it go and moved on. There's no easy way to do it, but you just have to take the blow, accept the time lost and stop letting more time slip away due to it. Thankfully I met somebody who would help me with that and she has been amazing. I really wish I could say all the ways she is, but I only have three thousand characters here! So I will say this. She's stubborn, dependable, cocky at times and had humor that matches mine. She's flawed, yet perfect if that makes sense. I didn't make her out to be unrealistic in my mind and she never required it either, so I'm happy to be with her. With this one I can move on without worry and know that even if something happens, it's not the end of the world.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 7th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.22222222222222224, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(7, \"unchange\") # Seventh sentence remains unchanged", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"I had to wait for her to get bored of me, find another person to obsess over and let her dump me for things to be peaceful.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Keep the 1st and 10th sentences unchanged:\n\nIt's important to express your feelings as personally as possible so that your partner can get the closure that he or she needs.  Avoid breaking with a text message or using online messaging. These forms of communication are much less personal than a phone call or a video chat, and your partner may not be able to get the closure that he or she needs. If you've been with someone for a long time, it may seem callous and anti-climactic to break up over text. Avoid posting the breakup publicly on social media like Twitter or Facebook. This may come across as passive-aggressive, and your partner may retaliate publicly. Set a time and a medium for the conversation. This will prepare him or her for a serious conversation, and it will give you impetus to actually go through with the break-up.  For example, send a message: \"Are you around for a phone call this evening at eight? There's something that I need to talk to you about.\"  If you have a regularly-scheduled \"Skype date\" or evening phone call, consider breaking the news during this time. \"We need to talk\" is near-universal code for \"There's something wrong with this relationship.\" If you prime your partner with these words before the break-up conversation, he or she may go into the call with an inkling of what is to come. If you have been having trouble in your relationship for a while, he or she may even expect it. Get it over with. Say, \"I hate to do this over the phone, but I need to say what I feel. This relationship isn't working for me, and I want to break up.\"  Lay out your reasons for ending the relationship. Be gentle and kind, but do not compromise. Speak honestly and speak from the heart. For example: \"I can't handle the distance any more. It's eating me up and splitting me apart inside. You're a wonderful person, and I hope that you find someone who can give you what you need--but I can't be that person.\"  For example: \"I don't see us winding up in the same city within the near future, and I don't want to keep pouring time and energy into something that isn't going anywhere.\" This is especially important when you aren't breaking up in person. Do not make the break-up sound like a deal or a suggestion. Be sure of your resolve and be clear in your intentions.  Try to keep your explanation short and simple. The longer you linger, and the more you say, the more complicated the break-up may become. Words can tangle. Try to avoid an argument. Don't accuse your partner of anything, and don't lay blame. Explain that the break-up is about you and your inability to stay emotionally invested in this relationship. Be patient and empathetic. Let your partner speak his or her side of the story, and listen.  Stay on the line for as long as it takes to help your now-ex along the path to closure. Be aware that he or she may not find peace immediately, depending on how emotionally invested he or she is in the relationship. When there is nothing more to say: hang up. It's over. Consider mailing a box of things, or giving the items to a mutual friend to deliver.  Tell your partner how you plan to return their things, and be sure to follow through. This is a kind gesture, and it may give your partner some peace of mind to know that they'll be getting their possessions back. Get this over with as soon as possible. This will help you both move on from the break-up. If you procrastinate, you will only feel worse about returning the things later on.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.4, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo_full_length": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"look\", 0, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], \"change\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"It's important to express your feelings as personally as possible so that your partner can get the closure that he or she needs.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Words can tangle.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"It's important to express your feelings as personally as possible so that your partner can get the closure that he or she needs.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"It's over.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 10], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain fewer than 10 words:\n\nWhen he goes in for a kiss, surprise him with lip gloss that has flavor to it. That way you will taste twice as good.  Even some chapsticks have flavor to them.  Katy Perry's cherry chapstick comes to mind. Some lotions have flavored scents too. Make sure your breath smells good. Carry small breath fresheners in your purse, and make sure to brush and go to the dentist for regular teeth cleanings. You can enhance his experiences of being with you if you share sensual food with him.  Share chocolates with him or berries.  Chocolate releases the chemical serotonin in the brain, which creates feelings of pleasure. Bake him homemade cookies and share them after a sexy date with a bottle of wine. You want something light. Think vanilla. Or a faint musky smell. You don't want to smell like your grandmother. Perfume should be lightly applied, but you want a signature scent.  At the same time, he will get used to your scene over time, so now and then mix it up and surprise him with something new. Lather on lightly scented lotion in something like lilac or, again, vanilla, which has been tied to increased desire. Spray perfume in the air and walk backwards through it. This way, when he hugs you, you'll smell good to him because his head will be near your back.   Above all, don't put on too much perfume. Men hate this. No one wants to hang out with a walking department store. There's nothing hotter than when a man's hand brushes your legs, and they're silky soft. You want skin a man wants to touch.  To get soft skin, use a hydrating exfoliating body scrub to remove dry skin from your body. These scrubs also have a nice scent.   Choose a razor designed for women so you catch all the stubble when you shave. Then, put body lotion or body butter all over your body. Although men like a girl who can hang with them, they aren't likely to classify a tomboy as \u201chot.\u201d If you play up your femininity, it will make him feel manly and protective.  Wear skirts and dresses more than pants. This will make you look more feminine. If you wear blue jeans, avoid jeans that are too plain or have holes in them. Touch is sensual. Take care of your hair. A flip of shiny, healthy hair is bound to attract any man. It's hot to have bouncy, shiny hair.  Get natural color or subtle highlights. Avoid the \u201cskunk\u201d look or anything too overdone. Avoid tight permanents. Men like hair they can run their fingers through. Get regular hair cuts every 6 weeks to get rid of split ends. Wearing your hair swept to the side looks romantic and hot, especially if you put a few beachy curls in it with a curling iron or medium-sized rollers. Apply a shine spray to your hair after styling. This will give your hair more gloss. Use salon shampoo and conditioner. If you don't put good quality products on your hair, the results will show. Wear your hair down, and don't use a lot of hairspray. Men tend not to be fans of overly styled hairdos. They don't want to feel like their hands will be covered with product if they run their fingers through your hair.   Don't stick too close to obvious hair trends. Find a look that suits your personality and your face shape instead.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"flavor\", 1, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"less than\")"]}}}

It was a great way to end the semester after all the new concepts I have learned from the online ARTH 100 course. Walking through the DIA and seeing concepts that each artist included into their own works of art was truly beautiful, and I wasn't able to see this type of beauty portrayed in their work until after I had taken this course online. Furthermore, one of my many favorites had to be Fowl and Melons, an oil canvas painting, painted by Sisson Blanchard  who is from Haiti, born in 1952. This oil painting was truly beautiful and caught my eye due to the colors and uniqueness of the birds. Looking deeper into the painting were details that didn't originally catch my eye, and that I had to look for. That being said, there were watermelons actually painted in between the birds in this painting! That being said, colors had a big influence on how my eye caught these details. The colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue and purple; it gave off a warmth feeling of harmony. I believe there is a reason why the artist choose these colors after staring at the painting for so long and my theory comes down to this: I believe that due to the amount of scattered birds in this picture, the artist wanted to balance this by carefully choosing which colors to incorporate into this painting without taking away the uniqueness of the painting. As far as shape goes, the lines formed by the artist is what makes the shape of the painting; mainly targeting the birds and the hard-to-miss details of the melons in between. The texture in this painting is oily (which is ironic considering it is an oil painting), but the details such as the feather bumps and circles make it as if the birds were rough and bumpy. Then on the other hand you have a bunch of shrubbery in all the possible spaces where there wasn't a bird placed. The shrubbery makes you feel as if you were to get poked by touching this painting, just like as if you were about to touch a cactus. Finally we have the last element of art; Value. Value is the illusion portrayed by the artist by using different shades and tones of light in the painting. Since this painting is very cluttered and there are so many details to be contributed in this piece, we can see that the value of light used in this painting was strong due to the colors used in the painting as well.  Overall, the trip to the Detroit Institute of Art museum was an experience that I previously wasn't planning on going on, anytime in the near future; but I'm glad I took this opportunity to look at different works of art and to analyze paintings using what I've learned from this course. It was a great opportunity to look at beautiful expressions that the artists portrayed using something as simple as oil pastels, like Sissan\u2019s did while painting Fowl and Melons.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.8, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.4, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Detroit Institute of Arts\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

Here is the revised text:\n\nPlease enhance the following text, ensuring that the word 'Marcia' remains unchanged:\n\nDear diary -- Today, Marcia and Jan actually asked when Bobbie and Greta would be visiting again! That's kind of amazing. I didn't write about it when it happened because things were so busy then, but a couple of months ago, B&G stayed over with us for a week while their mother was recovering from surgery. John had to work, and he asked me if they could stay with us. I was kind of worried. Sure, John and Mary and the kids used to live next door to us (which is how John and I *ahem* connected), so the kids all knew each other, but it had been a couple of years since they split up and sold the house, and I wasn't sure how this would work. And Bobbie and Greta were kind of standoffish at first, and who could blame them? But Marcia and Jan were oblivious, thank heavens. They took B&G to the mall, and to the theme park, and they snuck around next door when the \"new\" neighbors weren't home and peeked through the windows, which must have been weird for B&G. Their old place has changed -- a lot -- and they were pretty quiet that night. John came over every evening after work, which is *not* normal, and that was tense at first because it's not normal, but it got better. Mainly, I was glad to see M&J reconnect with their old friends. After a while, it was like one long sleepover. By Saturday, they'd run out of things to do, and G&B were due to go back home on Sunday, so we just stayed around the house. John was at Mary's, making sure she was ready to take back the kids, so it was just us girls. It was a warm, still summer evening, and we went out back after supper to sit on the porch. When the fireflies started to come out, Bobbie and Greta squealed like eight-year-olds, not the teens they are now, and asked if I had any bottles.

If you've come across a good cigar but don't want to smoke it that day, you can take a few simple steps to keep it fresh.  A cigar should be stored around 70 degrees F, with a humidity of around 70%. In some climates, like Miami, a cigar can be left in its wrapper and stored for a short period of time without much concern for freshness. If you're in Arizona or Alaska, however, the dryness will likely need to be addressed if you need to store the cigar for more than 24 hours.  The tobacco in good cigars was grown in a tropical climate, somewhere between 65 and 72% humidity. Cigars are made from whole wrapped sheets of tobacco, and the construction relies upon them staying oily and moist. Cigars not stored at the optimum temperature and humidity can dry out, crack, or mold. If you're a burgeoning aficionado and want to store lots of cigars for any length of time, you need to purchase a humidor and store your cigars in it. Skip to the next method. If you've got a cigar or two but can't smoke it right away, the best way to store it is in an open ziplock bag with a slightly-moist towel at the mouth of the bag, in a dark space kept at around 70 degrees.  Humidor bags are commonly sold at many cigar retailers, which can keep cigars fresh for several weeks. At good cigar shops, the tobacconist will often ask you about how long you're going to keep the cigar, and might pack the cigar in one of these bags anyway. Talk it out and ask; you stand to learn a lot. The towel should be clean and only very slightly moist, preferably with distilled water. After a few hours, check on the bag to make sure no dampness is accumulating inside. If so, open the bag more and pull the towel back slightly. Cigars can and do mold. Alternatively, cigars can be stored in a clean plastic tub, covered with a very-slightly damp, almost entirely dry towel and kept at the proper temperature. However you choose to store your cigars, the temperature is the most important factor. If your cigar came wrapped in a cellophane wrapper, or came in a cedar sleeve, or other type of tube, it's perfectly fine to keep it in the wrapper until you plan on smoking it. Cellophane will allow air to get to the cigar, while other types of tubes and sleeves will protect the cigar during transportation. Cigar enthusiasts differ on the topic of removing cigars from sleeves or storing them in sleeves for longer periods of time. For short periods of time, there's nothing to worry about. All cigar smokers agree, though: for longer than a day or two, you either need to smoke it or get it in a humidor. It's a common misconception that freezing or refrigerating cigars is an effective way of keeping them fresh. Nothing could be further than the truth, unless you want a cigar that tastes like refrigerator. Even if the cigar is overheated, or the temperature is too humid, or not humid enough, never keep your cigar in the refrigerator.  Cigars aren't stored in perfectly-sealed environments, because they need to breathe. Don't put a cigar into a plastic box with a sealable lid, or keep it in the freezer, unless you want to ruin it. Cigars stored with a moist towel in a plastic box will likely become over-saturated, and could even mold after a short time. If there's absolutely nowhere to store your cigar at 70/70, keep it in a relatively cool place in your house, if you live in a warm climate during summer, or keep them in the kitchen (the warmest room in the house) if its winter in a cool climate. Spritz some water periodically into the air to work a bootleg humidifier into the equation. It's not ideal, but you can save a good cigar some grief. Or you could always just smoke it. When you're buying, if you know you don't have someplace to store the cigar, and you know you won't want to smoke it right away, ask for advice at the store, and ask if they've got an old cigar boxes lying around, preferably cedar for purchase or for free. Sometimes, they'll just give them to you. Kept in a cigar box, in a cool room, cigars will be fine for a while.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["plaintext", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

The Bookmarks Manager lets you order your bookmarks, make and organize folders, rename or edit bookmarks, and search all of your links. Make sure you have the latest version of Bookmarks Manager by navigating to \"About Google Chrome\" (URL: chrome://chrome/). If you don't have the latest version it will auto-update from this site. This is how you adjust your settings in Chrome. Click on these bars and a small white menu will appear, starting with \u201cNew tab.\u201d This icon is often called the \"Hamburger Icon\" colloquially. \u201d A second menu will appear with some options on the top and all of your bookmarks on the bottom. From here you can see your bookmarks and do some basic organizing.  Click \u201cBookmark this page,\u201d to automatically bookmark whatever website is currently open in your browser. \u201cBookmark all Open Pages\u201d will make a bookmark for every open tab you have. Click \u201cShow Bookmark Bar\u201d to conveniently display your bookmarks as buttons underneath your search bar. Click and drag your bookmarks to reorder them or place them in folders. Right-click on a link to edit, rename, or copy and paste a bookmark. This opens up a customizable page that lets you easily edit your bookmarks. Your bookmarks are displayed as a list in the center and all of your folders are displayed in a bar on the left. Double-clicking on a bookmark opens it up in a separate tab, while clicking on a folder shows you the bookmarks in that folder. Look at the folders on the left side of the screen. You will likely see a series of \"nested\" folders, which is when you have one folder inside of another. They will be organized into any of three basic folders. All of your bookmarks must fit into these three larger folders.   Bookmarks Bar: This is reserved for your most popular bookmarks. Anything in here will also show up on the bar at the top of your Chrome screen.  Other Bookmarks: This collects everything you have not put in your Bookmark Bar.  Mobile Bookmarks: If you've connected your Google accounts between your phone and computer then this folder will appear with all of the bookmarks you've saved on your Chrome Mobile App. Organizing your bookmarks from this page is easy -- simply click a link, hold down the mouse button, and drag it to the folder you want. Let go of the mouse to drop the bookmark in. Clicking either of the small words at the top of your bookmark manager will bring up a small menu that allows you to add new folders or links. You will be asked to name the bookmark and attach a link, or choose where the folder goes. None of these decisions are permanent, however, as you can always drag and drop them into new places. You can also undo your past changes from this menu. You can also edit the link or copy and paste the bookmark somewhere else. Simply right-click and choose \"Edit Bookmark/Folder\" to give a description, change the URL, or rename the link. This is the best new feature with Chrome\u2019s Bookmarks Manager\u2014the search bar reads the titles of your bookmarks and words on the pages too to let you search anything. For example, if you favorited a few \u201cBest Movies of the Year\u201d lists and want to quickly see if American Hustle was on them, you could search for the title without clicking through every bookmark.

You are all studying the same materials, so you all have a common goal. Look for people in your class that also might benefit from a group study session.  You want to make sure the people you choose are people you can get along with. You want the study session to be productive, not full of drama. Although you can socialize a little bit when you first meet up, make sure you don't waste a lot of time just talking. Try to get straight to studying as soon as you can. One of the benefits of studying in a group is that they can help you understand concepts you aren't sure about. If you have a question, ask one of your group members to help you understand. The whole group will benefit from the discussion. If you were alone and confused, you would be more likely to get bored because you couldn't engage with the material. Now, you can engage with the material and with each other in order to better understand the information. This can help those who fill uncomfortable asking questions in class. If you are too shy or embarrassed to ask your professor when you are in class, you can ask one of your group mates instead. This way, you avoid any uncomfortable situations and can get the help you need. A great way to learn tough material is to teach it to others. In your study group, assign each other sections of the information to reteach to the study group. This way, not only will you benefit from teaching it to others, you will also get to learn from your group mates and get a different take on the material. Plus, with so many people talking about different topics, it will be really hard to get bored while you study. Once you have studied in a group for a while, you can start quizzing each other on the information you have been learning. You can make flash cards or try a round robin approach, where each group member asks a question to the group and, once it gets answered fully, the next person gets to ask the question. This will help you stay engaged in the information because it isn't just you quizzing yourself. In situations like this, the others are there to help you see different angles and to help you come up with ways to remember the information. When you have a ton of people, you can create multi-player games to help you all learn the information. If you love a sport, make it into a study game. Find a board game you all like and turn it into a study session. Before you know it, you will all have the information memorized and you will not have to worry about boredom.  Play a basketball game like Horse. Every time any of you miss a question, you lose a letter. To gain a letter back, you have to get the question right without looking at the answers. This will get a little competition going and help you all learn the material. Take a board game like Trivial Pursuit and turn it into a study game. Assign a subject or facet of your subject to each color. For example, if you are studying history, you can break your questions down into categories based on centuries, decades, or large concepts you need to remember. Each time you land of a specific color, you have to answer a question about that topic.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain fewer than 21 tokens:\n\nHold the clinometer so the curved rim of the protractor is facing downward. Tilt the clinometer until you can look through the straw or paper tube and see the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a building. You can use this method to measure the angle between you and the top of that object, or the object's height. Keep the clinometer steady in that position, until the dangling string becomes still. Calculate the angle between the midpoint of the protractor (90\u00ba), and the point where the string crosses the rim by subtracting one from the other. For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is 90\u201360=30\u00ba. If the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150-90=60\u00ba.  The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba since 90\u00ba is straight up in the sky. The answer will always be positive (greater than 0\u00ba). If you subtract the larger number from the smaller and get a negative number, just cross out the minus sign to get the right answer. For example, if you calculate that 60-90=-30\u00ba, the actual angle of elevation is +30\u00ba. The tangent of an angle is defined as the side of a right triangle opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the triangle is formed by three points: you, the base of the object, and the top of the object. The \"opposite\" side from this angle is the height of the object, and the adjacent side is the distance between you and the object's base.  You can use a scientific or graphing calculator, an online tangent calculator, or a chart listing tangents for various angles. To calculate the tangent on a calculator, press TAN and enter the angle you found. If the answer is below 0 or above 1, set your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again. If you want to find out how tall the object is, you'll need to know how far away you are from its base. Measure using a tape measure. If you don't have one, count the number of ordinary steps it takes to get to the object, then measure the length of one step once you find a ruler. The total distance is the length of one step multiplied by the number of steps you took.  Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge. Remember, the tangent of your angle is (object's height) / (distance between you and the object). Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll be left with just the object's height!   For example, if the angle of elevation was 35\u00ba, and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 x tangent(35\u00ba), or 31.5 units. Add your own height at eye level to your answer, since that's how far your clinometer was above the ground.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 21 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"]}}}

When you are moving down the hallways, walk with your back straight and your shoulders back. Don\u2019t be afraid to make eye contact with people! Don\u2019t look down at the ground as you walk. When you speak, try to talk loudly enough that people can hear you, and enunciate your words so you don\u2019t mumble.  You can still walk and talk with confidence even if you feel nervous and unsure of yourself\u2014chances are people won\u2019t notice you\u2019re nervous and you will still appear confident. It may sound silly, but try practicing walking and talking when you\u2019re at home. Try narrating what you are doing when you\u2019re in your bedroom to practice speaking clearly and at the right volume. rather than a follower. Try your best in your classes, and make an effort to share your ideas with others. Encourage others to do their best and offer to help others when you can. By establishing yourself as a leader, others will be drawn to you and will be interested in spending time with you. Part of being a leader is being open-minded and letting other people have turns, whether you\u2019re in class, practice, or even just hanging out. Try to be patient with others and to not rush to be first. You may be tempted to put down peers who are different from you, but doing so only makes you look small. Be an example and respond to other people when they speak to you. Say \u201cthank you\u201d when someone helps you, and sincerely compliment others when they succeed.  If you are working in a group with other students, show respect by being on time and doing the work you\u2019re supposed to do. Show respect for your teachers and coaches, too. Sometimes people think it\u2019s cool to disrespect people in authority, but it\u2019s to your benefit to be respectful of others. often and try to be positive. Have an open demeanor and try to look for the good in things. Being negative or complaining are quick ways to turn others off from being around you. If something doesn\u2019t go your way, use it as a learning experience rather than getting down on yourself. If you are self-conscious about your smile, try practicing in the mirror. The more you get used to seeing your smile yourself, the easier it will be to do when you are at school. Be aware of not posting things that make fun of others and avoid posting photos or statuses that use crude language or inappropriate humor. Use your social media to share things about your hobbies, books you are reading, events you\u2019ve gone to, or fun things you do with your friends and family. Try to keep your posts positive and lighthearted. Being a careful social media user will give others the impression that you are kind and not over concerned with what others are doing, which makes you appear more confident. If being on social media is stressful for you or causes anxiety, consider limiting how much time you spend on it, or think about getting rid of your account(s) altogether. Take care of yourself, and remember that oftentimes what other people post on social media is curated and might not actually reflect what their real life looks like.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.25, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval() \u2192 score", "keyword_frequency_check(\"confidence\", 3, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], \"change\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"be\", 8, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"]}}}

I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(1, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

I had to sell it because I lost my job and I had to save my family home from foreclosure until things get better again. I dreamed about this car since I was a boy of seven while looking at car magazines with my school buddies.  One day I came home from school and told my mom and dad that some day this car would be mine. They just laughed at my naive childhood dreams, they were simple country \"folk\", living in rural Texas. My was father a strict military man, stationed at a Fort Hood army base, and certainly not interested in fast cars or any \"fancy\" things like that. He would say that such things were a \"foolish waste of time and money\" and that a man's job is not to own \"fancy\" things but to serve his family and put bacon and bread on the table. However, I  was a free spirit, quiet different from my parents and their ways. I followed my dream of the \"super car\" and purchased my corvette when I turned twenty-two with my own hard-earned money. I loved my car all these years, not as a fancy object that I would show off to others, but a symbol of my own hard work and dreams. It represented my character and \"together\" we went through some many memorable experiences in life.  It was a very tough and heartbreaking decision to sell it, however, I had to do it for my wife and my two children. Their well-being and comfortable is much more important to me than any sentimental object-even my \"super car\". I told myself that when things turned around again, I could always get another one. Cars can be easily replaced but a family happiness in once in a lifetime. My heart broke when I took it out of the garage for the last time and handed the keys to a young man who came to purchase it all the way from Salt Lake City, Utah, with his father. I looked at his face and saw his eyes shining with excitement. he reminded me of myself when I first got my car, a dreamed who reached his goal! I wished him good luck and I hope that he will enjoy it as much as I did all these years. I felt very sad, however, it was priceless when my five-year-old son ran into my arms and said : \"Dad, when I grow up, I will buy you the faster car ever and we will fly!\".", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"my\", 4, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

We decided to go the back way since it has less traffic and we can avoid the highway since we were pulling the trailer. It was a 2 lane road with a few sharp turns. When we were driving near the one big sharp turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and I thought \"this is awful fast for the SUV to drive like that\". Right about 2 secs after we saw the SUV, it lost control and rolled off the road. IT was horrible because that was my first time saw a real accident like that happened. The SUV rolled into the bushes, and we were the only two people there at the time. We parked the car off the road, called 911 and ran over. The guy passed out, we couldn't really pull him out that easy since the SUV was on the side, so we had to climb to the top of the car and lift to open the door and try to lift him up. Meanwhile there was something in the back of the car that was making the hissing sound, like a gas tank. I was so scared and my friend told me to stay away from the car while he was still trying to get the driver out. Finally after about 5mins, there were some other cars drove by and saw what happened, they stopped and started to help my friend. I went to check on what was making the noise and it was a tank but not has tank. I told the guys who were helping there that to remove the tank first to make sure it is safe. Then I was there try to direct the traffic. Then there was this car drove up, stopped, and a woman ran out of the car and started to scream and cry. She came to me and I held her and she was crying so hard and she was telling me \"I told him he shouldn't be driving\". Then I knew it was someone she knows. I was really sad but I tried to calm her down and I told her that \"he looked ok, he had safety belt on, probably just passed out, he will be fine. Trust me\". I was really calm at the time, I didn't know how did I do that, I guess I was trying to calm her down.  Then later the cops were there, they thanked us, we gave them our contact information in case they need more information about what happened and then we left. Later that day we saw the woman on local news and she thanked us on the news and she wanted us to call her but we never did, we thought we just did what we should do and we don't need anything in return.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge. I'm ready for what's to come and whatever life throws at me. I know it'll be a tough next couple of months and it's going to get even tougher until the next opportunity comes along, but I'm ready to fight with all I've got.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 16 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Aruba\", 1, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"stress\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"to\", 5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], \"change\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain fewer than 23 tokens:\n\nMany people find the decision to stop cutting first comes from within. Before reaching out to another person, it may be helpful to think about why you need and want to change your behavior.  People have different motivations for quitting. You may be motivated by a desire to manage your pain better. You may be fearful of the behavior getting worse, or getting sent to the hospital. You may also worry about how your cutting affects friends and loved ones. Whatever your reasons, identify why you want to quit. Starting a journal to write down how you are feeling when you want to cut can help understand how to stop or find other coping methods. It can even help to write down a list of reasons that you do not want to cut anymore. You can refer back to this list in moments when you feel tempted. It is very hard to stop cutting on your own. It can be helpful to open up to someone when you begin the quitting process. This person can provide you with support along the way.  Choose someone you know you can trust. You do not want to pick a friend who's notorious for gossip or someone who is judgmental. It may be a good idea to tell a parent, as your mom or dad can help you find professional help. It can be scary to admit to someone you have been cutting. You may be afraid of an adverse reaction. Keep in mind, however, you will probably feel relieved once you tell someone. It's very hard to keep things bottled up, and you will feel better once you've reached out and asked for support. Consider speaking with your pediatrician or family doctor as a first step. They can be a very helpful resource. It may be easier to tell your parents, too, if you have already talked about it with your doctor and you, your parents, and your doctor can discuss it together. Your comfort is very important. Telling someone you have been cutting is not easy, and it's important you open up in a way that makes you feel safe.  You do not have to have a face-to-face conversation right away. If the idea of telling someone directly is scary, try writing a letter or email. Allow the person to process, and then talk face-to-face later on. You don't have to share everything. If you're not ready to open up about some information, give yourself time. Make it clear to the person you may not answer all the questions they have. You do not have to show your injuries or explain any details you're not ready to share. Focus on your feelings when you talk to the other person. Do not talk primarily about the self-harm behavior. Talk about the feelings, situations, or emotions that led to the behavior. For example, \"I've been so stressed about school. I think I'm having trouble managing my emotions about my senior year.\" It can be shocking to hear a loved one is cutting. The person you open up to may need time to process the information. Have some patience.  You may dislike someone's initial reaction. Remember, reactions are usually temporary. Just because someone responds with shock, fear, or anger does not mean they will feel this way forever. These reactions usually come out of concern for you. It can help to print out some pamphlets about cutting that you find online. Many people do not understand self-harm. Having some reading material can help them process. If you have already reached out for help from a health professional, such as your family doctor or a counselor at school, it may be helpful for you and your parents to meet with them so they can support you as you tell your parents. It's great to have someone to support you as you quit. However, a friend, family member, or loved one may not be able to help you during a crisis.

Make sure there is nothing in your way or moving toward you that you may need to take into account before backing up.  It\u2019s okay to use your mirrors to aid in your check, but it\u2019s important that you actively look around to ensure you don\u2019t miss anything. Make sure to look toward the ground on either side of your vehicle using your head and mirrors to ensure there are no people or animals laying in your path. When driving forward or in reverse, your right foot should be the only one on the gas or brake pedal.  If your car is equipped with a standard transmission, your left foot manages the clutch, but in vehicle\u2019s with automatic transmissions, the left foot simply goes unused.  Press your right foot on the brake pedal firmly, so that the vehicle won\u2019t move once it is in reverse.  The brake pedal is in the middle on vehicle\u2019s equipped with a standard transmission and is the furthest to the left in automatic vehicles. The brake pedal is the widest pedal. While it may be customary to drive with your hands at ten and two o\u2019clock on the steering wheel, backing up will require that you turn your body to the right.  Place your left hand at the top of the wheel so you can easily make small adjustments to keep the vehicle moving straight as you back up. It may be difficult to reach the steering wheel with your right hand while backing up, so steering with one hand is optimal. Depending on the transmission your vehicle came equipped with, there are a few ways you may need to shift into reverse.  On automatic vehicles, it usually requires pressing a button on the shift lever and pulling it backward until it is aligned with the letter \u201cR.\u201d  In standard vehicles equipped with a five speed transmission, you can usually shift into reverse by pressing the shift lever all the way to the left and pulling it backward.  In vehicles equipped with six speed standard transmissions, reverse is usually all the way to the left and up, next to first gear. Some cars require that you press down on the shift lever or press a release to access the reverse gear. If you are unsure of how to shift into reverse, refer to your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. Provided your view is not obstructed, twist your body to the passenger side so you can look out the back window of your vehicle over your right or passenger side shoulder.  Make sure you do not remove your foot from the brake pedal.  If you are driving a box truck or other vehicle that blocks your view out the back window, you will have to rely on your side mirrors to guide you.  You may choose to place your right hand on the top of the passenger seat to help you comfortably look out the back. If you are relying on your mirrors, make sure to check each of them frequently. As you take the pressure off of the brake pedal with your right foot, the vehicle will begin to move backward.  Most vehicle\u2019s engines idle at a high enough RPM (revolutions per minute) to propel the vehicle without any need to apply the gas. Keep your foot hovering over the brake pedal as you back up just in case you need to stop or slow down.  Ease off the brake slowly to ensure you do not accelerate too quickly to easily manage.. If your vehicle is equipped with a standard transmission, you will need to use the gas as you ease off the clutch, but can then allow the vehicle to idle.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 37 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.25, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["python", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"]}}}

Explicit morphological information also bene\ufb01ts myriad NLP tasks, such as parsing (Hohensee and Bender, 2012; Seeker and C\u00b8 etino\u02d8glu, 2015), language modeling (Blevins and Zettlemoyer, 2019; Park et al., 2021; Hofmann et al., 2021), and machine translation (Dyer et al., 2008; Tamchyna et al., 2017). For low-resource languages, valuable morphological resources are typically small or non-existent. Of late, the \ufb01eld of computational morphology has increased its efforts to extend the coverage of multilingual morphological resources (Kirov et al., 2016, \u2217*The \ufb01rst two  2018; McCarthy et al., 2020a; Metheniti and Neumann, 2020). Simultaneously, there has been a revival of minimally supervised and unsupervised models for morphological tasks, such as segmentation (Eskander et al., 2019), in\ufb02ection (Kann et al., 2017b), and lemmatization (Bergmanis and Goldwater, 2019). Given the speed of recent developments, it is important to re\ufb02ect on where we are as a \ufb01eld and what future challenges lie ahead. To this end, we survey recent computational morphology: we review existing multilingual resources (\u00a72) and tasks and systems (\u00a73), with a focus on low-resource languages. Given recent developments in unsupervised segmentation, low-resource morphological in\ufb02ection, and unsupervised morphological paradigm completion (Jin et al., 2020; Erdmann et al., 2020)\u2014which we argue is not fully unsupervised\u2014we believe the community is poised for the next logical step: inferring a language\u2019s morphology purely from raw text. In \u00a74, we formalize a new task: truly unsupervised morphological paradigm completion (tUMPC). We then introduce a pipeline with two novel components (\u00a74.3): one model for aligning paradigm slots across lexemes and another for predicting the slots of observed forms. With these, we assess several state-of-the-art models and the in\ufb02uence of different types of unlabeled corpora within the framework of tUMPC. While existing methods leave room for improvement, they perform reasonably enough to support our argument that inferring a language\u2019s morphology from raw text is within reach and worthy of community efforts. To summarize, we present the following contributions: (i) a survey of tasks and systems in computational morphology with a focus on lowresource languages; (ii) models for the tasks of paradigm slot alignment and slot prediction, (iii) a formalization of the task of truly unsupervised morphological paradigm completion and (iv) an evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches and differ            \fent corpora within the framework of this task.

Each sentence should contain fewer than 32 tokens:\n\nWhen processing language, humans selectively attend longer to the most relevant elements of a sentence (Rayner, 1998). This ability to seamlessly evaluate relative importance is a key factor in human language understanding. It remains an open question how relative importance is encoded in computational language models. Recent analyses conclude that the cognitively motivated \u201cattention\u201d mechanism in neural models is not a good indicator for relative importance (Jain and Wallace, 2019). Alternative methods based on salience (Bastings and Filippova, 2020), vector normalization (Kobayashi et al., 2020), or subset erasure (De Cao et al., 2020) are being developed to increase the post-hoc interpretability of model predictions but the cognitive plausibility of the underlying representations remains unclear. In human language processing, phenomena of relative importance can be approximated indirectly by tracking eye movements and measuring \ufb01xation Figure 1: From the \ufb01xation times in milliseconds of a single subject in the ZuCo 1.0 dataset, the feature vector described in Section 3.2 for the wors \u201cMary\u201d would be [2, 233, 233, 431, 215.5, 1, 1, 1]. duration (Rayner, 1977). It has been shown that \ufb01xation duration and relative importance of text segments are strongly correlated in natural reading, so that direct links can be established on the token level (Malmaud et al., 2020). In the example in Figure 1, the newly introduced entity Mary French is \ufb01xated twice and for a longer duration because it is relatively more important for the reader than the entity Laurence, which had been introduced in the previous sentence. Being able to reliably predict eye movement patterns from the language input would bring us one step closer to understand the cognitive plausibility of these models. Contextualized neural language models are less interpretable than conceptually motivated psycholinguistic models but they achieve high performance in many language understanding tasks and can be \ufb01tted successfully to cognitive features such as self-paced reading times and N400 strength (Merkx and Frank, 2020). Moreover, approaches to directly predict cognitive signals (e.g., brain activity) indicate that neural representations implicitly encode similar information as humans (Wehbe et al., 2014; Abnar et al., 2019; Sood et al., 2020; Schrimpf et al., 2020). However, it has not been analyzed to which extent transformer language models are able to directly predict human behavioral metrics such as gaze patterns. The performance of computational models can             \fbe improved even further if their inductive bias is adjusted using human cognitive signals such as eye tracking, fMRI, or EEG data (Hollenstein et al., 2019; Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Takmaz et al., 2020). While psycholinguistic work mainly focuses on very speci\ufb01c phenomena of human language processing that are typically tested in experimental settings with constructed stimuli (Hale, 2017), we focus on directly generating token-level predictions from natural reading. We \ufb01ne-tune transformer models on human eye movement data and analyze their ability to predict human reading behavior focusing on a range of reading features, datasets, and languages. We compare the performance of monolingual and multilingual transformer models. Multilingual models represent multiple languages in a joint space and aim at a more universal language understanding. As eye tracking patterns are consistent across languages for certain phenomena, we hypothesize that multilingual models might provide cognitively more plausible representations and outperform language-speci\ufb01c models in predicting reading measures. We test this hypothesis on 6 datasets of 4 Indo-European languages, namely English, German, Dutch and Russian.1 We \ufb01nd that pretrained transformer models are surprisingly accurate at predicting reading time measures in four Indo-European languages. Multilingual models show an advantage over languagespeci\ufb01c models, especially when \ufb01ne-tuned on smaller amounts of data. Compared to previous psycholinguistic reading models, the accuracy achieved by the transformer models is remarkable. Our results indicate that transformer models implicitly encode relative importance in language in a way that is comparable to human processing mechanisms. As a consequence, it should be possible to adjust the inductive bias of neural models towards more cognitively plausible outputs without having to resort to large-scale cognitive datasets.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.8, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}}}

Instead, try making the most of the ink that's trapped inside the marker itself. To start, tie a long string around the body of the dried-out marker. Secure it to the string with sturdy tape. In the next step, you'll use the power of centrifugal force to force ink into the  dried-out tip of the marker. Centrifugal force is basically the idea that objects being swung in a circle experience a force that pushes them \"outward\" \u2014 that is, away from the center of the circle. In this case, the outward-pushing force will move any remaining ink from the body of the marker into the tip. First, check to make sure the cap is on securely and completely encompasses the tip. WARNING: check carefully to see if the cap has openings, if it does, ink may fly out and splatter the room. Carefully take the length of string in your hand and swing the marker in a circular arc over your head (like a lasso). The tip of the marker should be facing out, not in. Centrifugal force will begin to push the ink in the marker toward the tip. Do this for about 30 seconds before testing your marker. Some ink may spill out when you open the cap. Be sure to open the marker away from carpet or other fabric. Make sure you have plenty of room around you free from obstructions before you start swinging the marker. Though you're very unlikely to cause serious injury by swinging a marker around, you can still break your marker or hurt someone if you accidentally swing the marker into his or her eye, so err on the side of safety. If you can't get your marker to write after using the lasso method above, grab a pair of pliers and try this method. Grip the soft fabric tip of the dry-erase marker with your pliers and pull directly outward. For many markers, the tip should come out without too much effort. Once it's out, if there's a similar soft fabric end on the other side of the tip, try flipping the tip around and replacing it. The marker should be able to write immediately. As ink soaks through the previously dry end of the tip, you can remove the tip again and flip it back around if you wish. You may want to wear gloves and protect your work area with an old rag while attempting this method. Though unlikely, it's possible to spill ink out of the marker once you remove the tip, so having some protection against difficult-to-remove stains is a wise idea. While effective, the methods above will only work if ink remains inside the marker. For dry-erase markers that are completely dry \u2014 that is, both the tip and the inside of the marker are dried out \u2014 you may need to buy replacement ink. Refill dry-erase ink can usually be purchased from office supply stores or specialty online retailers. Usually, dry-erase is quite cheap \u2014sometimes as low for $1.00 for a small canister of ink.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

Cutting the tongue can be a painful and frightening experience, so help whoever is injured to relax.  Keeping both yourself and the injured calm will help as you treat the injury. Before touching or helping anyone with a cut, you should wash your hands to reduce the chances of infection.  You may also want to use medical gloves when aiding the victim, as blood can carry diseases. By sitting up straight and tipping the mouth and head forward, blood can flow out of the mouth, rather than down the throat.  Swallowing blood can cause vomiting, and sitting up with the head tilted forward will help prevent this. A cut to the tongue will likely produce a lot of bleeding; however, it is the depth and size of the injury you will examine.  If the cut itself is shallow, you can proceed with home treatment.  If the wound is deep or longer than \u00bd an inch, your should seek medical attention. If something has punctured your tongue, it may require professional care. If you suspect foreign material has become lodged in the wound, you need to see a doctor. Use gauze or a clean cloth to apply steady pressure to the injury for about fifteen minutes.  This will help stop the flow of blood.  If you notice blood has soaked through the cloth or gauze, apply more, without removing the original piece. Wrap an ice cube in a clean, thin, cloth.  This will be held against the wounded area to reduce blood flow and prevent pain and swelling.  Hold the ice bundle directly on the wound for no more than three minutes at a time. This can be done up to ten times a day. You may also simply suck on an ice cube or hold one in your mouth.  To make the application of ice more enjoyable, you can try using a popsicle. Apply ice only on the first day of the injury. Make sure both your hands and the cloth are clean. The day after the injury is sustained, you should begin rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution.  This can be done up to six times a day. Rinsing your mouth helps keep the wound clean. If your teeth have not been injured as well, you may continue regular dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth.  Make sure there were no injuries to your teeth before continuing any brushing or flossing.  Do not brush or floss injured or broken teeth. If you have also suffered a dental injury, see a dentist as soon as you can. As the injury heals, you should monitor its progress. Look for any signs that it may not be healing correctly or if another issue is arising.  Seek medical attention if you notice any of the following signs:  If blood flow doesn't stop after ten minutes. If you develop a fever. If the wound is excessively painful. If you notice pus coming from the wound. Chances are that a cut tongue will be sore and sensitive.  For a few days after the tongue is cut, you may want to change what foods your eating.  This can help reduce discomfort and prevent possibly injuring your tongue further.  Avoid eating foods that are hard.  Opt for soft foods instead. Try to avoid foods that are extremely hot or cold. Most cuts to the tongue should heal without trouble.  After first aid and general care has been given, the final step is to simply wait for the injury to heal.  Exactly how long the time it takes to heal will depend on how severe the injury is.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}}}

You will extract chemicals from the cabbage to coat your pH paper. These chemicals are known as anthocyanins and are found in plants such as cabbage, roses, and berries. Anthocyanins are purple under neutral conditions (pH 7.0) but they change color when exposed to an acid (pH < 7.0) or a base (pH>7.0).  The same procedure can be followed using berries, roses, and other anthocyanin containing plants. This does not work for green cabbage. The same anthocyanins are not present in green cabbage. You can boil the water on a stovetop or in the microwave, but either way you'll need about 500 mL of water. Pour the boiling water directly into the blender with the cabbage. This will help draw the needed chemicals out of the cabbage. You need to blend the water and cabbage for best results. Keep the mixture blending until the water is dark purple. This color change indicates that you have successfully drawn the needed chemicals (anthocyanins) from the cabbage and dissolved them in the hot water. You should allow the contents of the blender to cool for at least ten minutes before proceeding. You want to remove any pieces of cabbage from the indicator solution (colored water). Filter paper will work in place of a strainer, but may take more time. Once you have strained the indicator solution, you can throw away the cabbage pieces. Adding about 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol will protect your solution from bacterial growth. The alcohol may start to alter the color of your solution. If this happens, add vinegar until the solution goes back to dark purple. You can substitute ethanol for isopropyl alcohol, if necessary or desired. You want a container with a wide enough opening to dip your paper. You should choose a container that is stain-resistant, as you are pouring dyes into it. Ceramic and glass are good options. Make sure to push the paper all the way to the bottom. You want to cover all corners and edges of the paper. It is a good idea to use gloves for this step. Find a location that is free of acidic or basic vapors. The paper should be allowed to dry completely before proceeding. Ideally, you will leave it overnight. This will allow you to test several different samples. You can cut the strips any size you would like, but generally the length and width of your index finger is fine. This will allow you to dip the strip into a sample without getting your fingers into the sample. You can test household solutions such as orange juice, water, and milk. You can also mix up solutions for testing, e.g. mixing water and baking soda. This will give you a wide range of samples to test. You should use an airtight container to store the strips until you use them. This will protect them from environmental contamination such as acidic or basic gases. It is also ideal not to leave them in direct sunlight, as this could result in bleaching over time.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

Furthermore, recent studies show that models pre-trained on a massive amount of code also achieve competitive performance on many tasks, e.g., code generation and \u2020 Corresponding authors. 1Our code and dataset are available at  com/dashends/CodeSyntax. Figure 1: Examples of syntactic relations for (a) natural languages (NL) and (b) programming languages (PL). Each relation is represented by an arrow. The relations in PL represent the syntax of code in a way similar to those in NL. Figure 2: A preview of the model performance comparison on NL and PL syntax understanding tasks. Pretrained models capture NL syntax relatively well, but perform worse in understanding PL syntax. The Offset baseline picks the token using a \ufb01xed positional offset. We use BERT-large and RoBERTa-base con\ufb01gurations (corresponding to the con\ufb01gurations of CuBERT and CodeBERT). The plot shows top-1 scores. See Tables 3 and 4 for the full results. code classi\ufb01cation. These tasks are closely related to natural language (NL) tasks in their problem formulation. Nowadays, the common practice for solving these coding tasks is to utilize the language model architectures and training schemes that are originally designed for NL. The design principle of these neural language models is signi\ufb01cantly different from the classic rule-based program generation There were many pioneer PC contributors.result = object.function(argument)rootexplnnnnamodnsubjAssignAttributeCall(a)(b)OffsetBERTRoBERTaCodeBERTEnglish Syntax Understanding47.164.662.759.3OffsetCuBERTCodeBERTRoBERTaPython Syntax Understanding43.639.233.134.5            \fsystems. Speci\ufb01cally, neural language models take the program as a token sequence, while classic program generation systems utilize the language grammar and code structure. Despite the advanced performance of pre-trained language models on code understanding tasks, what these models have learned from the code corpus remains unclear. In this work, we investigate whether large-scale pre-training is all we need for code representation learning. In particular, we conduct the \ufb01rst systematic study to analyze how the pre-trained language models understand the syntactic structures of programs. To this end, we introduce CodeSyntax, a large-scale benchmark consisting of programs annotated with the syntactic relationships between different tokens. The ground truth syntactic relationships are extracted from edges in the abstract syntax trees (AST) of the programs. Figure 1 shows some examples. These syntactic relations are function-wise similar to dependency relations for NL, where prior work has demonstrated that the attention heads of pre-trained language models can help to identify NL relation types (Clark et al., 2019; Raganato et al., 2018). To measure how well the pre-trained language models capture the code syntactic structures, we adopt the approach to the PL domain. We focus on investigating the zeroshot capability of existing pre-training methods in our experiments, and we evaluate these pre-trained models without \ufb01netuning them on our benchmark. We evaluate the state-of-the-art pre-trained language models for code representation learning, including CuBERT (Kanade et al., 2020) and CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020). A common characteristic of these models is that they share the same Transformer-based architectural design as NL models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019). This allows us to directly compare their performance in capturing the syntax structure. We present a preview of our key results in Figure 2. Our main observation is that pre-training is insuf\ufb01cient for learning the syntactic relations in code. First, we \ufb01nd that the models pre-trained on code do not always outperform models pre-trained on NL corpus alone. Surprisingly, compared to CodeBERT which is trained on both text and code corpora, RoBERTa achieves better performance without training on any code with identical model architecture. This indicates that pre-training on programs as token sequences does not help learn the syntactic relations. On the contrary, without dependency relations, pre-training still enables language models to understand the NL syntax to some extent. Moreover, for code syntax understanding, the pre-trained models even perform worse than simple baselines that pick the tokens with a \ufb01xed offset. For example, always selecting the (p+2)-th token as the p-th token\u2019s dependency yields higher accuracy than any attention head for several relation types. On the other hand, the same model architectures pre-trained on text corpora achieve decent accuracy in identifying the dependency relations in the NL domain, where the performance of the same simple baselines is far behind. Our analysis reveals several key differences between NL and PL that lead to different capabilities of understanding the syntax for pre-trained models. First, programs are more structured than NL sentences. Programs usually contain hierarchical structures representing long-term dependencies between code tokens. Consequently, a large number of syntactic relation types are between distant tokens, which can be dif\ufb01cult to recognize for attention heads. On the contrary, the dependency relations in NL sentences mostly connect nearby token pairs, and in this case the attention heads are more capable of identifying the correct relations. Meanwhile, language models are good at recognizing keyword-based relations, such as picking the corresponding else keyword for an if token. Interestingly, we \ufb01nd that the inclusion of tokens such as newlines and semicolons notably affects the performance in the code domain. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that existing pre-trained models perform quite differently in PL and NL domains in terms of the ability to understand syntax. Thus, directly applying training paradigms developed for NL could be suboptimal for program learning, and we consider designing better approaches to model the code structure as future work. CodeSyntax: Benchmarking Code Syntax Understanding We construct the CodeSyntax benchmark to evaluate the performance of language models on code syntax understanding. We focus on Python and Java languages, on which the publicly released model checkpoints of both CuBERT (Kanade et al., 2020) and CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) are pretrained.

Configure the items in your organizer by tone, or group like products together to streamline your morning routine.  Hiding the organizer in a drawer may help reduce clutter, though many are unassuming enough to be left out in plain sight.  Some organizers are designed with flair in mind as well as functionality. Keep your overarching theme in mind when picking out one of these decorative storage aids to make sure it's a good match for the rest of your decor. Invest in a set of sleek holders to highlight your collection of bracelets, necklaces, and rings. Not only will this spare them the fate of being lost in a drawer somewhere, it will also keep them together for comparison when you\u2019re deciding on a piece to pair with the evening\u2019s outfit.  Choose holders and similar displays that are in keeping with the style you\u2019ve chosen for your dressing area. Minimalistic holders in bold colors and abstract shapes will seem to rise right out of a sleek, modern desk, for instance, while a hand-carved wooden rack will look right at home on a rustic mahogany table.  Jewelry can make a dazzling decorative touch on its own, even if you rarely get a chance to wear it. Give yourself easy access to an electrical outlet so you can plug in your phone or tablet while you\u2019re freshening up. Do the same for your hair dryer, curling iron, laptop, speakers, and any other appliances you need to have close at hand. They\u2019ll stay powered up and you\u2019ll eliminate the need to make a million trips back and forth.  If open outlets are few and far between, a hidden power strip will make it possible to hook up more devices at once while also economizing the space you have available. Snap a selfie at your dressing table when you\u2019re done fixing yourself up to check out your handiwork! Deep trays with raised edges will work best, since they\u2019ll ensure that everything remains upright. Arrange the bottles from biggest to smallest, or order them into neat sections according to their purpose. Feeling and smelling irresistible will then be as simple as working your way down the line.  If you\u2019ve got too many products to fit into a single tray, go through and throw out anything you don\u2019t use to determine which ones make the cut. For a more picturesque presentation, transfer your liquid beauty products to ornate glass containers. Don\u2019t forget to label or color-coordinate the containers so you\u2019ll know what\u2019s in them. These smaller mirrors magnify your reflection slightly, which can come in handy for detail-oriented tasks like applying mascara, tweezing, and checking for blemishes. Clear some space near the center of the table where you'll have no problem focusing on your finer features. You can move your mirror around as needed to make room for other supplies.  Look for makeup mirrors in shapes, sizes, and frame materials that complement your other furnishings. Many makeup mirrors also include convenient built-in lighting elements, eliminating the need to tilt your face at impossible angles or rely on a harsh overhead fixture.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_full_length": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_count_check(14, \"more than\")", "for i in range(len(text.split('.'))):", "sentence_length_check(len(text.split('.')[i].split()), \"more than 10\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

In addition, the companies are not required to show evidence that supports their claims.  Having said that, there is some good preliminary evidence to support the possible benefit of some herbal products.  Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your existing medication regimen. This includes adding or changing herbal products. Herbs are drugs that have side effects and have the potential for serious drug interactions. North American ginseng root has been rated by a division of the United States National Library of Medicine as being possibly effective in preventing colds.  Taking 200mg twice a day during the cold and flu season may help to prevent catching colds or possibly even the flu.  The study suggests this may be effective in adults ages 18 to 65. The researchers go on to report that it may not help to prevent the first cold of the season, but may help to prevent further colds. Some evidence suggests that garlic may have some ability to help fight infections.  Laboratory work has shown garlic to be effective against bacteria, fungal, and viral infections like the flu and the common cold. While this work is promising, human research is yet to show efficacy in controlled scientific studies. There is clear research that now supports the work done by \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that lives in the gut in helping your immune system to function properly.  Probiotics do support good bacteria, but the direct scientific link between taking probiotics and improving your immune system is still not established.  Take care to choose probiotic products carefully as they are not regulated and they are not all the same. Products that contain herbs like aloe vera, echinacea, and licorice root, claim to help fight infections.  Many of these agents can be harmful and scientific evidence to support their claims of efficacy specific to improving your immunity is lacking. This does not mean the claims are not true, but there is little evidence to support the claims.  Echinacea has been written about many times, claiming to help with the prevention of colds. Echinacea may shorten the duration of your cold; however, researchers at Harvard suggest using echinacea with caution.  In addition, echinacea can be dangerous. People with allergies to ragweed have suffered serious allergic reactions when taking echinacea, including some episodes of anaphylactic shock.  There is little evidence that aloe vera does anything to alter the immune response. Topical application for various skin conditions has been shown to be helpful, but there is no evidence to support the use of aloe vera in preventing colds.  Licorice root has been used in Chinese medicine for many years; however, it is usually combined with other herbs and ingredients. The specific claims of efficacy for licorice root have yet to be scientifically validated.  Talk to your doctor before using licorice root since it can interact with many commonly used prescription medications. Do not use licorice root for an extended period of time.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}}}

Publicly available models, which are pre-trained on large amounts of data, have become a standard tool for many NLP applications, but are mostly available for English. While different techniques have been proposed to learn such representations (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014), all rely on the distributional hypothesis \u2013 the idea that the meaning of a word is captured by the contexts in which it appears. Thus, the quality of word vectors directly depends on the amount and quality of data they were trained on. A common source of data to learn word representations, available in many languages, is the online encyclopedia Wikipedia (Al-Rfou et al., 2013). This provides high quality data which is comparable across languages. Unfortunately, for many languages, the size of Wikipedia is relatively small, and often not enough to learn high quality word vectors with wide coverage. An alternative source of large scale text data is the web and resources such as the common crawl. While they provide noisier data than Wikipedia articles, they come in larger amounts and with a broader coverage. In this work, we contribute high quality word vectors trained on Wikipedia and the Common Crawl corpus, as well as three new word analogy datasets. We collected training corpora for 157 languages, using Wikipedia and Common Crawl. We describe in details the procedure for splitting the data by language and pre-processing it in Section 2. Using this data, we trained word vectors using an extension of the fastText model with subword information (Bojanowski et al., 2017), as described in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce three new word analogy datasets for French, Hindi and Polish and evaluate our word representations on word analogy tasks. Overall, we evaluate our word vectors on 10 languages: Czech, German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hindi, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Chinese.

I talked with them about the possibility of doing parking on their lots as well, with the option of splitting the proceeds 50/50 between them and me. It was surprising how beneficial the Garth Brooks concert ended up being because I made more money than I planned on making, and then that also gave me confidence to sell parking for a graduation ceremony a few weeks after the concert. After that, I sold parking for football games in the months that followed, and I coordinated with the neighbors I had talked to on Garth Brooks concert day, so that we were able to offer parking for the whole block on football games. Having the whole block available meant having approximately 30 parking spots to sell.  The football games attract large crowds and the ticket prices range from $50 to $100 depending on the game, so I was able to charge a relatively large amount for the parking spots for the football games. I was able to earn a nice amount of money that I then put into my savings.  Being able to \"live off the land\" by selling parking has helped me feel entrepreneurial while also helping to reduce stress by giving me a safety cushion of savings. I also found myself being responsible and helpful to the customers that were parking.  I learned that customers might have many questions about the event that they were attending.  I tried to prepare beforehand by reading details about gate opening times and other event-related details, so that I could answer questions questions might have when they were parking for the event. I have been pleasantly surprised because I made far more money than I anticipated making, no one had any problems with their cars, and my neighbors were able to make a good amount of money by entering into the 50/50 agreement with me, so the whole block of residents has enjoyed added happiness in recent months as a result of me first doing parking fo the Garth Brooks concert 8-and-a-half months ago. I also got to enjoy the good feeling of being able to offer tailgate chances for the football fans who wanted to park at the game very early before game time. The tailgate parties that developed on my parking lots remained safe and I made sure to patrol the areas regularly. I wanted to make sure the vehicles were not threatened, the people were not misbehaving, and the area was maintained in a clean manner during the event.  Overall this economic experiment of doing parking for the Garth Brooks concert ended up being a great idea, and I look forward to more parking chances in the months ahead.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 3th, and 5th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3, 5]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Cut the PVC pipe in half and bury it in the substrate to make cave. You can bury the pipe horizontally or vertically.  You can also place the cut pipes side by side for a different look.  If the PVC is untreated, rinse it with clean water before you place it into the crab's tank. Make sure the cave is big enough for your crab to move in and out of it. Purchase a new, untreated terracotta flower plot as a hiding place. Place the flower pot on its side and dig it into the substrate so that it is secure.  You can also make your own pottery piece to put in the tank.  Only use natural clay without additives when making your own pottery pieces.  Do not paint, glaze, or glue any of the clay pieces.  These chemicals are harmful to your crab. Use sand paper to remove any rough edges from your pot and wash it with hot water to get rid of dust. Hermit crabs enjoy a variety of places to hide and play.  Incorporate different materials and shapes into your crab's habitat. An even mix of open space and hiding space is ideal. Your crab may prefer some toys to others so you can adjust the habitat based on your crab's personality and preferences.  Fake plants, vines, and rocks can also be used for hiding places. You could also attach rocks to a the outside of a clay pot or PVC pipe cave. If you use rocks, attach them using aquarium safe silicone only. If you collect rocks instead of purchasing them from the pet store, you need to make sure they are safe to place in the tank. Wash and scrub the rocks and pour vinegar on them. If the rocks bubble, they are not safe to use.  Place the other rocks in a bucket of water with 1-2 cups of bleach.  Allow the rocks to soak for 24 hours.  After 24 hours, rinse the rocks and soak them in a bucket of clean water for 48 hours.  During the 48 hour soak, change the clean water every 12 hours to make sure that the bleach is gone. Boil the rocks for 6-8 hours in a large pot of fresh water, rinse them, and allow them to cool before you use them. If you do not want to go through this process, you can purchase rocks from the pet store that have already been sanitized. Transfer your crab to a small plastic container with a little bit of sand and remove the toys. Wipe the toys using warm, dechlorinated water.  Some toys (i.e. drift wood and rocks) can be boiled for a few minutes to kill bacteria.  Other toys (i.e. plastic caves, plastic plants) should not be boiled, just wipe them down.  Allow the toys to dry completely before you place them back in the tank.  Never use tap water to clean the toys. Hermit crabs are sensitive to chlorine found in most tap water.  Also avoid using and soaps or chemicals because they are harmful for your crab. Toys should be cleaned every 2 weeks to prevent mold and bacteria from growing on them.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 5th, and 13th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [5, 13]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"rinsing it with clean water\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"crab\", 2, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([2, 12], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

If you get paid twice a month, you may have two days a month that you pay bills. Whatever system you use, be consistent. Bills are often late because people do not have a time set aside to pay them.  Mark your calendar or create a reminder on your phone to help you remember to pay your bills. You may need to adjust your payment day for holidays or vacation times. Your bills may fluctuate each month. At the beginning of the month, create a checklist of the bills you are expecting. Have a place on the checklist to mark if the bill was received and when the bill was paid. The list should be kept in the area where you pay your bills.  If you are expecting a bill but do not receive it, check with the company to see if there was an error. You do not want to pay a bill late because you were not on top of things. Your list can be handwritten or electronic. Do what works best for you. Automated bill pay is good for expenses that do not change every month such as phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Find out on which dates the money will be deducted and write them down so that you are sure there is enough money in your account to cover it.  Automated payment is not good for bills that may change every month like your credit card bill. You can throw off your budget if the bill is higher than you expected. If you are using automatic payments for your credit card bill, make sure that you are at least paying the minimum amount.  Some companies charge for automatic bill pay. Make sure that it is a free service.  When you create your online account, sign up to receive notifications about your upcoming bills. These can remind you to check your account to make sure the funds are there and to pay your bill on time. Set up an online account for each of your bills. You can even connect the account to one of your bank accounts so you do not have to enter your payment information each month. Paying online saves you time and resources. You will not have to buy envelopes, stamps, or checks if you use this method.  An online account also gives you immediate access to other helpful information about your account such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Online payments are also processed faster than checks. There will be less lag time between your payment and your bank account balance. If you are sending a check in the mail, be sure that the check arrives by the due date or at least is post dated before the due date. If you can, pay your bill as soon as it arrives to avoid forgetting about it or mailing it in too late.  Make sure you are always stocked with the necessary bill-paying supplies such as envelopes, stamps, and checks. Keep in mind that the post office is closed on Sundays and Federal holidays.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"]}}}

LLMs have become increasingly prevalent in various socialinfluencing domains such as education (Kasneci et al., 2023; AlAfnan et al., 2023) and the technology industry (Dong et al., 2023), playing a more and more important role in social influence. The existence of bias is harmful under such a context, as the social influence of LLMs can further promote the underlying legal and ethical implications (Weidinger et al., 2021; Deshpande et al., 2023). Many previous studies have identified gender bias in NLP models (Gupta et al., 2022; Sheng \u2217Equally contributed et al., 2019). For gender bias in LLMs, previous works usually focus on certain tasks in the English context and use single-dimensional evaluation methods for gender bias (Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023), neglecting the fact that LLMs generally receive different types of instructions for different utilizing circumstances, where the gender bias can be reflected in different aspects. Considering the diverse language backgrounds of LLM users and the strong capabilities in multilingual reasoning of the LLMs themselves(Lai et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023; Rathje et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), it is important to emphasize the various language features and cultural influences that affect how gender bias occurs in different languages. Different languages may have different degrees of gender bias in LLM generations: such an understanding is essential for acknowledging and mitigating these biases in LLMs, guaranteeing they are more equitable and culturally aware in the wide range of applications. To address the above limitations for gender bias evaluation in LLMs, our study emphasizes the substantial role of conversations undertaken by LLMs and explores gender bias in different dimensions. In particular, we present three quantitative evaluation measurements for gender bias in LLMs, which can reveal three-dimensional aspects of gender bias. Based on the proposed measurements, we conduct experiments in six different languages using a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3/4 (Brown et al., 2020). allowing us to compare the levels and nuances of gender bias across these languages. Our approaches facilitate a comprehensive analysis of both lexicon and sentiment aspects of gender bias across different languages, providing insights into the fact that diverse instructions may influence gender biases in LLM generations in different ways. The main results of our exploration can be categorized into the following conclusions:", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 12 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 12}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"gender\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(12, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"LLMs\", 6, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

Each sentence contains fewer than 23 tokens:\n\nWhen you see a baby bird on the ground, your instinct may be to bring it inside and nurse it back to health. However, unless the bird has an actual injury, you\u2019ll probably do more harm than good this way.  Look for the following signs of injury or illness in both nestling and fledgling baby birds: bleeding or open wounds; lifelessness, with very little movement; appearing exhausted or dehydrated. If the bird is sitting calmly or is moving around, it probably isn\u2019t injured. If you\u2019re not sure, call a wildlife rehabilitator for guidance (see the step later in this section). Whenever possible, wash your hands and/or put on gloves to limit the transfer of bacteria or viruses. Then, place one thumb against the back of the bird\u2019s neck and scoop your other fingers beneath and around the bird. If the baby bird is too big for one hand, use both thumbs and scoop with both sets of fingers on opposite sides.  Grip the bird only tightly enough to prevent it from falling or escaping. Don\u2019t squeeze it. Also wash your hands thoroughly after you\u2019re done handling the bird. Any standard cardboard shoebox will do. Stick a folded-up T-shirt or several paper towels in the bottom to create a soft base. Use a pen or screwdriver to poke at least 12 holes in the lid.  Ideally, you\u2019ll either have someone else prepare the box while you keep holding the bird, or create an emergency nest box ahead of time for just such an occasion. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to work on the box with one hand while you hold the bird with the other, or find a soft, secure temporary spot (e.g., a deep bowl lined with paper towels) while you work. Fashion about 12 tissues into a donut shape in the center of the shoebox. Make the hole in the middle just large enough for the bird to fit. Then, gently lower the bird into the center of the tissue nest and release your hold.  The sides of the tissue nest should not be higher than the bird\u2019s head\u2014press them down some or remove a few tissues if necessary. A fledgling bird might move out of this spot and around the box\u2014that\u2019s OK. If the bird is unable to sit squarely over its legs with its head upright, try to position the tissues around it to prop it up. Especially if you\u2019re dealing with a feathered fledgling bird that could potentially escape, put the lid on right away and secure it with tape. But, in any case, put a lid on to keep the temporary nest dark, quiet, and cozy. If you have a heating pad, place it on its lowest setting and set the shoebox on top of it. If you don\u2019t have one, place the box in a warm, quiet spot in your house. Time is of the essence here\u2014if you can get the bird to a wildlife rehabilitator within 1-2 hours, its chances of survival will be much greater. Once you make contact with a rehabilitator, put the shoebox in your car and drive to their location as soon as you can.  Call your government\u2019s environmental, natural resources, wildlife, or similar department to find local wildlife rehabilitators.

Ensure each sentence contains more than five tokens:\n\nThough you may have wanted your children to keep running the family business, attend your alma mater, or be a high school soccer star like you were, you have to accept the fact that your children are their own people with their own needs and desires, and that they may not align with yours. You may think that your path is the only way to happiness, but to be a good father, you have to accept that your children may have a different idea of how to run their lives.  Though you may think that you're doing your best by telling your children what to do or how to live their lives, you're actually hurting their independence by trying to control them. It takes time to accept your children's desires. If you don't immediately understand why your child wants to be an artist when you are a doctor, ask for them to explain it to you and take the time to listen and understand. If you try to control your children too much, they'll resent you and will stop opening up. Let your children make their own decisions by letting them be independent and open-minded. You may want them to play baseball, but sign them up for a variety of activities and let them decide what they like best. To be a good father, you have to understand that your children aren't growing up in the same environment that you were raised in -- even if you're raising them in the same time. With globalization, the influence of social media, and the changing politics in today's society, it's likely that your children are less sheltered than you are and are more aware of the problems and changes in today's society.  Therefore, be aware that things like body piercing, premarital sex, and world travel are more common today than they were in your time. Accept that your children are a product of the times and that they may want to explore the world more than you did. You may feel like you know exactly how the world should work, but you should let your children express themselves and share their perspectives with you. If you want to be an understanding father, then you have to accept that, like you, your children aren't perfect, and that they're bound to make mistakes. Life is full of mistakes that help your children learn, and you should accept that many lessons are necessary -- whether your child gets into a minor car accident, fails a test because they didn't study, or made a foolish purchase with their savings.  If you don't let your children fail once in a while, then they won't learn anything. Though you may want to shelter and protect them, letting them make their own mistakes will help them make more informed decisions. You should still discipline your children appropriately when they make a mistake, but you should also talk about what they did wrong and let them see the error of their ways instead of just yelling at them. If you want to be a good father, then you have to be aware of when your children are having a particularly hard time and be attentive to your needs. Maybe your little girl is struggling because you moved to a new town and she doesn't have any friends, or maybe your son is going through his first break-up and is emotionally wiped.  Though you can't completely excuse your children's distant or emotional behavior, you should be aware of what's going through their heads so you can be more understanding and talk to them when they're struggling. Just saying, \"I know you're having a hard time. Want to talk about it?\" will help your children see how much you care. Try putting yourself in your child's shoes. If you're frustrated, understanding where your child is coming from will help you understand their behavior. Prioritize your children by always being accessible for talks, even if you don\u2019t fully agree with your child\u2019s choices. A child's life can be filled with pressures, from siblings to kids at school to teachers to coaches.  Help your child understand their desires and assess their capabilities and limitations.  Help them set achievable goals.  Encourage them to meet their full potential but avoid living vicariously through them by expecting them to achieve what you had achieved or hoped to have achieved. Do not assume that once your children turn 21, or they have a college degree, that your work raising them is done. Although it is important to encourage your children to become financially and emotionally independent, it is also important to let them know that you care and are always there for them and that they are valued.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["word_count_check(count=5, relation=\"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

Around Christmas time I started to really notice how many people were struggling around me. I knew it happened, but somehow I never really thought too much about it. About 2 weeks ago now, I was walking down the road on my way to get a cup of coffee before doing some Christmas shopping and I saw a bunch of businesses with people curled up outside them. Trying to keep themselves warm with blankets, sleeping bags and hats. Those were the lucky ones. I saw ones that were just huddled up inside doorways doing their best to stay warm and alive with empty cups in front of them, or signs. Just begging people to help them out with the basic needs that every human being needs and deserves. I don't know what it was that made me notice today of all days. Maybe because I was out spending too much money on Christmas presents that really weren't that needed when there are people who can't even afford a hot meal. I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch. I picked up some sandwiches for the others that I spotted and some hot cups of coffee, and of course a bag of dog food for his buddy. We delivered the food, and I've never seen such joy before. It was a good moment, I made a lot of people happy, but most of all, I made myself happy.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 4th, and 6th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [4, 6]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 5], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([4, 6], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain more than 9 tokens:\n\nYour inside hand is your hand furthest from the side of the boat you're paddling on. Your other hand should be positioned around 2-3 feet (0.6-0.9 meters) down from the top of the paddle. For example, if you're paddling on the left side of the boat, your right hand would be your inside hand. You would hold the top of the paddle with your right hand, and your left hand would be lower on the paddle. You want to bring the end of the paddle as far in front of you as you can without having to get up from your seat. For example, if you\u2019re supposed to be paddling on the left side of the canoe, you would insert the paddle into the water in front of you to the left of the boat. The end of the paddle should remain underwater. Push with your top hand and pull back with your bottom hand to move the paddle backward. When the paddle is behind you and you can't go back any further, lift it out of the water and gently swing it back around in front of you to where you first put it in the water. Repeat the process to move the canoe forward. This will keep you on a straight course and prevent the canoe from going in circles. For example, if the bowman is paddling on the left side of the canoe, the sternman should be paddling on the right. Both of your paddles should be going in and out of the water at the same time. The bowman (at the front of the canoe) should set the pace, and the sternman should adjust their paddling to match them. A \u201cJ\u201d stroke is a small backward stroke through the water. If you want the canoe to go left, the sternman should do a \u201cJ\u201d stroke on the left side of the canoe. To go right, the sternman would do a \u201cJ\u201d stroke on the right side of the canoe. The larger the backward stroke the sternman does, the more drastic of a turn the canoe will make. A draw is when you extend a paddle out away from the boat, holding it vertically so just the flat end of the paddle is in the water. Then you pull the paddle in toward the edge of the boat. If you ever need to make a sharp turn, both the bowman and sternman should do a draw on opposite sides of the canoe.  To make a hard left turn, the sternman should draw on the right side of the canoe. To make a hard right turn, the sternman should draw on the left side of the canoe. If you tip over, tuck the paddles and any of your belongings under the seats in the flipped canoe. Holding on to the canoe, swim toward the nearest shore. If you\u2019re canoeing in a river with a strong current, don\u2019t try to swim against the current. Hold on to the canoe if you can and wait for the current to slow down so you can swim to shore. If you\u2019re far from shore, try flipping the canoe over with your partner. It helps if you both get under the flipped canoe and lift it up with your arms before you try flipping it.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(100, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"for example\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"you\", 10, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}}}

Ensure that your output contains fewer than 23 sentences:\n\nRecent work in mining medical texts focus on building deep learning models for different medical tasks, such as mortality prediction (Grnarova et al., 2016) and diagnosis prediction (Li et al., 2020). However, because of the private nature of medical records, there are few large-scale, publicly available medical text datasets that are suitable for pretraining models, and real-world, private datasets are often small-scale and imbalanced. As a result, one of the biggest challenge in building deep learningbased NLP systems for biomedical corpora is the availability of public datasets (Wang et al., 2018). To tackle this problem, we present Medical Dataset for Abbreviation Disambiguation for Natural Language Understanding (MeDAL)1, a large dataset of medical texts curated for the task of medical abbreviation disambiguation, which can be used for pre-training natural language understanding models. Figure 1 shows an example of sample in the dataset, where the true meaning of the abbreviation \u2018DHF\u2019 is inferred from its context, and Figure 2 shows the pretraining framework. Although this dataset can be used for building abbreviationexpansion systems, its main purpose is to enable Figure 1: A sample in the MeDAL dataset. effective pre-training and improve performance on downstream tasks during \ufb01ne-tuning. The motivation behind using abbreviation disambiguation as the pre-training task is two-fold. First, abbreviations are widely used in medical records by healthcare professionals and can often be ambiguous (Xu et al., 2007; Islamaj Dogan et al., 2009).2 The ubiquitousness of abbreviations poses a restriction on building deep learning models for medical tasks, such as mortality prediction (Grnarova et al., 2016) and diagnosis prediction (Li et al., 2020). Second, we believe that understanding natural language in a knowledge-rich domain such as medicine requires understanding of domain knowledge at some level, similar to how humans can understand medical text only after receiving medical training. The abbreviation disambiguation task enables models to use domain knowledge to understand the global and local context, as well as the possible meanings of the abbreviation in the medical domain. Medical abbreviation disambiguation has long been studied (Skreta et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Joopudi et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019) and our work builds upon many of them. In particular, our data generation process is inspired by the reverse substitution tech2For example, \u2018MR\u2019 is a commonly used abbreviation which has a number of possible meanings, including \u2018morphinone reductase\u2019, \u2018magnetoresistance\u2019 and \u2018menstrual regulation\u2019, depending on the context. ... for obtaining bovine liver DHF reductase in high yield and ...... for obtaining bovine liver\u00a0\u00a0dihydrofolate\u00a0\u00a0reductase in high yield and ...Original text:Sample in MeDAL:Disambiguate:... for obtaining bovine liver\u00a0\u00a0dihydrofolate\u00a0\u00a0reductase in high yield and ...dengue hemorrhagic feverdihydroxyfumaratediastolic heart failure            \fFigure 2: Diagram of using MeDAL for pre-training NLU models in medical domain. nique (Skreta et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016). Our work differs from them in mainly two aspects. First, instead of trying to improve performance on abbreviation disambiguation itself, we propose to use it as a pre-training task for transfer learning on other clinical tasks. Second, existing datasets for medical abbreviation disambiguation, for instance CASI (Moon et al., 2014), are small compared to datasets used for general language model pre-training, and as noted by Li et al. (2019) some are erroneous. Thus, we chose to construct a new dataset large enough for effective pre-training. Our main contributions are: a) we present a large dataset for pre-training on the task of medical abbreviation disambiguation. b) we provide empirical evidence of the bene\ufb01t of abbreviation pre-training for a wide range of deep learning architectures.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

Allow the engine to cool for a few hours before opening the hood and looking for evidence of a coolant leak.  If the hood still feels warm, the engine inside is likely very hot. If your vehicle has been overheating, it will take even longer for it to cool enough to be safe to touch. Before starting any automotive project, you should put on the appropriate safety gear.  Because you\u2019ll be dealing with coolant that may be leaking, eye protection should be considered mandatory for this project.  Gloves are optional, but may protect your hands from scratches or bumps as you work.  Always wear eye protection when dealing with coolant leaks, as they may drip or spray under pressure. Glasses or goggles are both acceptable forms of eye protection for this project. Another common point of failure in coolant systems is the radiator cap.  When functioning properly, the radiator cap can release excess pressure that builds up in your coolant system, but over time it can become worn out or stuck.  If the radiator cap looks rusty, is corroded or caked in grime, it may be the cause of your coolant issues.  Replace your radiator cap simply by unscrewing it and screwing in a replacement.  Radiator caps are inexpensive and can usually be purchased at your local auto parts store. Never remove the radiator cap from an engine that is still warm.  It could spray hot coolant and burn you. The water pump in your vehicle pumps the water and coolant mixture through the engine and into the radiator where air flow helps to dissipate the heat.  Look for signs that your water pump is leaking or has failed if it is visible in your engine bay.  The water pump is belt driven, so inspect the belt for damage that indicates that the water pump pulley has stopped moving and has been rubbing against the belt.  Without a properly functioning water pump, your engine will not be able to dissipate the heat it produces as it runs, causing the vehicle to overheat. If the belt powering the water pump is damaged, it will have to be replaced after you put in a new water pump. If you are unsure of where to locate the water pump in your vehicle, refer to its service manual or the website for the auto maker. Look at the hoses traveling from the radiator and to the engine, then follow them along for as far as you can.  If any of the hoses are kinked, that will cause the coolant system to fail to function properly.  Cracks may also indicate a leak, but even if it isn\u2019t leaking yet, a cracked coolant hose should be replaced before it begins to leak.  Keep an eye out for damage to the hoses or signs of rubbing from the serpentine or accessory belts.  If one of the belts has been rubbing on a coolant line, they will both likely need to be replaced.  Make sure to install the new ones with enough clearance to avoid rubbing the belt on the hose.

Ensure each sentence has more than six words:\n\nproperly. Your piercer should give you specific instruction for how to clean your new piercing, including suggesting what products to use for cleaning. Different piercings have somewhat different cleaning requirements, so get clear, written instructions. In general, follow some simple guidelines:  Clean skin piercings with warm water and non-scented antibacterial soap, like Dial, or with warm salt water. Don\u2019t use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on the new piercing. These are too harsh and can damage or irritate the skin. Avoid using antibiotic creams or ointments. They trap dirt and debris and do not allow the piercing to breathe. Clean your piercing as often as your piercer recommends \u2013 not more or less. Under-cleaning can cause buildup of dirt, crust, and dead skin. Over-cleaning can irritate and dry skin out. Both are detrimental to healing. Gently move or twist the jewelry while cleaning it to get the solution inside the piercing and coat the jewelry. This isn\u2019t true for some types of piercings, so always ask your piercer first. Other than proper cleaning techniques, taking care of your piercing can help prevent unnecessary pain and infection. Some guidelines to follow for general piercing care are:  Don\u2019t sleep on your new piercing. Your jewelry can rub on your blankets, sheets, or pillows, causing irritation and getting the area dirty. Sleep on your back if you got a navel piercing; if your new piercing is facial, try using an airplane support pillow and aligning your piercing with the middle \"hole.\u201d Wash your hands before you touch the piercing or surrounding area.  Do NOT remove the jewelry before you piercing is healed. Doing so will probably let the piercing close up. If the area is infected, the infection will be trapped in your skin. Try not to let clothes rub directly onto new piercings. Also, do not twist your jewelry unless you\u2019re cleaning it.  Stay out of pools, lakes, rivers, hot tubs, and other bodies of water until your piercing heals. About 1 in 5 piercings get infected, usually because of unsterile piercing procedures or improper aftercare. Only ever get pierced by a trained professional and in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, insist that your piercer show you how and where their equipment is sterilized \u2013 they should have an autoclave, and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant.  Piercers should only ever pierce you with a new needle out of a sterile package, NEVER a reused needle, and they should always wear fresh, disposable gloves while piercing.  A piercing gun is NEVER appropriate. Walk out if you see a piercing gun. Go to a professional to ensure a sterile procedure. Check with your state legislation about what licensing and training someone needs to have in order to pierce you. Do NOT pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you. Though having an allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same thing as getting an infection, anything that irritates your new piercing also increases the risk for infection. A severe allergy could also force you to remove your new jewelry. Always get pierced with hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance for good healing. Request stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold. There are lots of places you can get pierced, through different types of tissue in areas that get more or less blood-flow. Thus, healing time varies a lot. Know the specifics of your piercing so you know how long you have to take extra care of it (for a specific piercing not listed, consult your professional piercer):  Ear cartilage, nostril, cheek, nipples, navel, and dermals/anchors/surface piercings: 6-12 months Earlobe, eyebrow, septum, lip, labret, beauty mark, and Prince Albert: 6-8 weeks Clitoral hood: 4-6 weeks Tongue: 4 weeks\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}}}

Visit the website of the charity or organization that you want to donate to, look at the menu for the word \u201cdonate,\u201d click on it, and then continue to click and fill out information as you\u2019re prompted to do so.  When big natural disasters take place, it\u2019s likely that the donations given to these relief-focused nonprofit organizations will go towards helping victims. If you want to be sure of this, look on the website for a mention of the specific natural disaster. Go to https://give.hands.org/ and fill out your preferred donation amount and credit card or PayPal information to donate to All Hands Volunteers. Go to https://www.habitat.org/impact/our-work/disaster-response to donate to Habitat for Humanity\u2019s disaster relief fund. Pay attention to how much the donation fees are when donating to a nonprofit's website. Some nonprofits will ask that you cover the standard donation fee, so that all of the money can go to the organization. Many charities and organizations have phone numbers that are easy to remember so that you can pick up the phone, dial the number, and follow the automated menu in order to donate money. Often when hurricanes devastate an area, organizations, like the Red Cross, will set up a phone number and message that you can text to make a quick, easy donation.  For example, donate to Salvation Army by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY. It is wise to inquire about texting fees, as they can be much higher than normal text message rates. You can typically find these phone numbers on the website of the organization or charity that you\u2019re donating to. Facebook makes donating easy just after a major natural disaster has taken place. Sign in, look for the \u201cExplore\u201d heading, click on \u201cFundraisers,\u201d click \u201cCrisis Relief,\u201d and then scroll through the different options and click \u201cDonate\u201d once you\u2019ve found the one you want to donate to. This should take you to a page where you can select the amount you\u2019d like to donate and fill out payment information. You can also \u201cshare\u201d your donation so that others may see that you donated and want to donate as well. Apple has come up with an easy way for you to donate money to hurricane relief, as long as you have an iTunes account. If necessary, put money into your iTunes account, and then sign in and click the \u201cDonate\u201d button underneath the amount you\u2019d like to donate. This will transfer 100% of the amount you selected from your iTunes account to the Red Cross. This may only be an option immediately following a natural disaster. Apple typically provides this donation opportunity temporarily in response to a particular disaster that has devastated an area. While it\u2019s a little bit riskier than donating to a big organization, you can donate to individuals affected by the hurricane and learn about their personal experiences on https://www.gofundme.com. Type the name of the hurricane into the search bar at the top of the page, scroll through the many different fundraisers, click on the one you want, and then click the \u201cDonate Now\u201d button. Then, enter in the desired amount and your payment information.  You can also \u201cshare\u201d your donation on social media to show others how they can help. GoFundMe staffers claim that donations go directly to beneficiaries, and not to any middle men, in order to ensure that the money gets to the right person or people. Very rarely, people lie about the causes they create pages for. In most of these instances, GoFundMe staffers will recognize a campaign as \u201cintentionally misleading\u201d and reimburse all donations.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"donate\", 3, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 9], \"change\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"donate\", 2, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"charities\", 2, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"organizations\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

Water flushes out your system, removing unneeded toxins, making it easier to lose weight. Moreover, water is free of calories, making it a much better choice than sugary drinks. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only water, your odds of losing the weight will increase. If you need something flavored from time to time, choose unsweetened tea.  This should be 24/7, apart from right before a workout. Then you can feel free to chug a cup of black coffee (or with a splash of skim milk). The caffeine blast is reported to give you a kick, making you work out a little bit harder.  It turns out drinking water can up your metabolism, too, in addition to making you feel full. Recent studies show that drinking two glasses of cold water can up your metabolism about 40% for 15-20 minutes. Participants in these weight loss studies reportedly lost 15 pounds in three months, largely by drinking only water. Cut it out completely. Someone following a standard diet can usually afford to fall off the junk food wagon once or twice without suffering major repercussions. For more extreme, short-term weight loss goals (like this one), however, junk food must be completely avoided.  Stay away from greasy, fatty foods as well as those with a high sugar content. Anything battered, fried, covered in chocolate, packaged, or loaded up and preserved with sugar is a no-go. Be sure to read your labels. Even things like yogurt and granola bars can be powerhouses of sugar. While many people think of these as healthy, they're actually not. Everything from pasta to cookies is full of simple carbohydrates that are actually sugars in disguise. These little villains spike our insulin levels, upping our fat stores, and ultimately increase our body weight. To lower the spike, cut out the processed carbs \u2013 that means white rice, bread, and potatoes, in addition to cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream.  You may be better off cutting out carbs in general. Let's face it: 20 pounds in 2 weeks is a tall order. To put your body in ketosis, where it's feeding off your fat stores and not your glycogen stores (because those have been depleted), you'll have to go completely low or no carb. In addition to no sweets, you'll have to cut out starchy vegetables (potatoes, squash, carrots), whole grains (including quinoa and brown rice) and sugary fruits, like bananas, oranges, and apples. What's more, being hungry makes the temptation to cave to your old habits all the more powerful. Consistently eating good-for-you, healthy foods keeps the other cravings at bay. When you're more full, you make better decisions. Whether or not negative calorie foods are truly negative is up for debate. As the theory goes, some foods take so much energy to digest that eating them actually burns more calories than the foods contain. Even if you do not burn calories eating these foods, though, you will not gain many calories from them, either.  In the way of vegetables, eat more asparagus, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. As for fruits, gravitate toward blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon. Instead of beef and pork, opt for leaner meats like chicken or fish. Consuming fish is especially helpful because the fatty acids in fish give your body the beneficial oils it needs, and may help subdue the urge to consume greasy or fattening foods. And as for vegetables, go for it. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner \u2013 pile 'em on. They're nutritious, generally not full of calories or sugars (again, no potatoes), and keep you full. They're the shortest track to losing weight there is. . The fact of the matter is that in the short term, fad diets can work. If you're looking to lose weight very quickly and don't care if you gain it back, then a fad diet could be okay for you in this situation. Just realize that, in general, they're not healthy and their effects do not last for long. One of the most common fad diets right now is juicing. Another contender is the Master Cleanse diet \u2013 both of which are liquid-based diets. These offer quick results, but are hard to adhere to and are not wise to stay on for long. If you're desperate, look into them, but take their advice with a grain of salt.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

Each sentence contains more than three tokens:\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Elman, 1990; Mikolov et al., 2010) are remarkably powerful models for sequential data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), a speci\ufb01c architecture of RNN, has a track record of success in many natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (J\u00b4ozefowicz et al., 2015), dependency parsing (Dyer et al., 2015), sentence com1Our code and data are available at  com/ketranm/RMN pression (Filippova et al., 2015), and machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). Within the context of natural language processing, a common assumption is that LSTMs are able to capture certain linguistic phenomena. Evidence supporting this assumption mainly comes from evaluating LSTMs in downstream applications: Bowman et al. (2015) carefully design two arti\ufb01cial datasets where sentences have explicit recursive structures. They show empirically that while processing the input linearly, LSTMs can implicitly exploit recursive structures of languages. Filippova et al. (2015) \ufb01nd that using explicit syntactic features within LSTMs in their sentence compression model hurts the performance of overall system. They then hypothesize that a basic LSTM is powerful enough to capture syntactic aspects which are useful for compression. To understand and explain which linguistic dimensions are captured by an LSTM is non-trivial. This is due to the fact that the sequences of input histories are compressed into several dense vectors by the LSTM\u2019s components whose purposes with respect to representing linguistic information is not evident. To our knowledge, the only attempt to better understand the reasons of an LSTM\u2019s performance and limitations is the work of Karpathy et al. (2015) by means of visualization experiments and cell activation statistics in the context of character-level language modeling. Our work is motivated by the dif\ufb01culty in understanding and interpreting existing RNN architectures from a linguistic point of view. We propose Recurrent Memory Network (RMN), a novel RNN architecture that combines the strengths of both LSTM             \fand Memory Network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). In RMN, the Memory Block component\u2014a variant of Memory Network\u2014accesses the most recent input words and selectively attends to words that are relevant for predicting the next word given the current LSTM state. By looking at the attention distribution over history words, our RMN allows us not only to interpret the results but also to discover underlying dependencies present in the data. In this paper, we make the following contribubeen shown to outperform GRUs on language modeling tasks (J\u00b4ozefowicz et al., 2015). In the following, we will detail the LSTM architecture used in this work.
