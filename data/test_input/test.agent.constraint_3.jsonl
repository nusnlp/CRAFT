You will be in a more positive mood, and able to think better about the big picture. Plus, smiling will make you look friendlier and more confident, the kind of person others want to meet and hang out with. Try to remember to smile when you are going about your daily business, such as during your morning commute, while doing household chores, and even while relaxing in the evening. You might even want to set a reminder on your phone to remind yourself to smile more. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by a focus on where you are and where you need to be. The tension involved in trying to move quickly can cause stress. Taking a few minutes every day to pause and relax will help you recharge, and approach your challenges with energy. Activities like yoga or mindfulness exercises, which force you to slow down and consider only the moment, are good ways to help slow down your daily grind. Doing them will make you pause and find space in your mind to focus on other things. Try taking a class or watching a video online to learn a basic yoga routine. At first, it might be hard to just start appreciating your life, especially if you\u2019re feeling down. So fake it. Put on a smile, or say something nice about somebody. You\u2019d be surprised how this little change in your action can help change your mindset. For example, if you are having a bad day at work, then try to take the focus off of yourself by asking a coworker how her day is going, or by giving someone a compliment. By focusing on someone else, you might find yourself feeling more positive and happy. . Your mental well-being is tied to your physical health. When you are trying to feel good about your life, make sure you are taking care of your body to be in the best physical shape possible. You don\u2019t need to turn into a swimsuit model, but you do want to make sure you are taking care of yourself. Plus, as you get into better shape, you\u2019ll begin to feel more confident in how healthy you look and feel.   Exercising is a great way to get yourself in shape. Just a little bit of exercise, even something as simple as ten minutes of walking every day, helps get your muscles moving and causes your brain to release feel-good endorphins. Plus, when you work out, your body will look better, and you\u2019ll have more energy.   Eat well. Good nutrition will help give you energy and keep your body looking good. Focus on whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins while avoiding sweets and processed foods. Controlling your portions is another good way to help keep your weight normal and healthy.   Make sure you get enough sleep. Getting sleep can help you stay charged and positive, plus it will give you the energy to get things done. A full night\u2019s sleep is great, of course, but you can supplement that with naps throughout the day if you need to. Most people need seven to eight hours of sleep every day to be at their best, but some can get by with a little less.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 9th, and 12th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [9, 12]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727273, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"look\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"be\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"9th sentence.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"12th sentence.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(len(text.split('.')), \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"9th sentence.\", \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"12th sentence.\", \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"]}}}

Do not replace the word 'them':\n\nSome friends may be fake, but some friends may be shy or have a real difficulty connecting with others. If they are real friends, they may have the following characteristics.  They might not always say the right thing, but are willing to listen to you if you are struggling. They make you feel comfortable being yourself around them. They support you. They keep in contact with you all the time and not just when they want something. They stick around during the hard times, not just the fun times. They care about your well-being and safety. Try and determine if they are a fake friend. If they are, consider what they might be trying to gain from pretending to be friends with you. If they are a fake friend they may:   Talk about you behind your back. Use you to climb up a particular social chain. Use you to get close to someone you are close to. Copy your work or use your intelligence. Try to get some sort of information from you. Only talk to you when they need something. Embarrass you or make you feel humiliated in public. If you feel that your friend has changed, or that you are growing distant from each other, it may be a sign that your friendship is fading out. Even if you used to be close friends, people grow apart. Don't fight that growth, just be glad for the good times you spent together. If you feel you are growing apart as friends, you may not have to proceed through a formal break-up. You may choose to just let the friendship naturally fade. This may be a good alternative option to take if you feel like there is no strong reason you don't get along. Especially, if it's just that you have developed different interests and different groups of friends. Removing the benefit may go against your nature or personality if you tend to be a \u201cpeople-pleaser,\u201d but your fake friend may be taking advantage of you. Additionally, they might leave you alone after they know they can't get what they want from you.  If you think they are trying to copy your work, make it impossible for them by moving your seat or not letting them see your work.  If you believe they are using you to get to someone else, keep contact with the person while the fake friend isn't around. If they only call you when they want something, deny whatever their request is. You could even tell them that you won\u2019t be able to fulfill their request in the future either. For example, \u201cJenny, I know I\u2019ve been giving you rides to work for the past month, but I\u2019m not able to do that anymore.\u201d As you are preparing to end your friendship, distance yourself from the fake friend as much as possible. Politely decline invitations to hang out by saying \u201cI'm sorry, I can't right now.\u201d The purpose is to give yourself a little space free from the stress of a fake friendship, while you figure out how to end the relationship with them. Try to avoid outright ignoring them or giving them the \u201csilent treatment.\u201d Those are perceived as immature and will likely cause an angry reaction from the fake friend and drama with any mutual friends you have. Talk to your family, close friends, or your support system; and see what they say about the situation. Maybe they will be able to offer you an alternate perspective or advice on what is going on. If you don't feel comfortable talking to close friends, or if you are not particularly close with your family members, seek advice from a school counselor or therapist. School counselors have added experience in dealing the relationships and friendships in a school setting that you might find helpful. Going through with the termination of a friendship is a big deal. It is hard to come back from if you regret your decision later. Try to consider other options if you are currently in a fight, or if you are just trying to get them to do something specific. If you really want to end the friendship, you should be able to think of several reasons why this friendship makes you unhappy and why you think you would be healthier without this friend around. Consider writing a pro and con list of your friendship and see how it weighs out.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'them'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "them", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.75, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"them\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}}}

You can guide her away from these areas by using people as barriers, as she'll likely run away from them. Watch the rabbit to see where she hides. Build a large enclosure around her using the exercise pens or wood-and-chicken-wire frames. The easiest way to surround the rabbit is to have several people holding different pieces, forming a large enclosure. Hold the pieces to the ground so the rabbit cannot escape underneath. Slowly work the enclosure smaller by taking out sections while still maintaining a tight circle, making it easier to trap the bunny. Just be sure you don't leave anywhere that she can escape. Once the enclosure is small enough, you should be able to gently pick up the rabbit. It is easiest to climb in the enclosure with the rabbit. When picking up the rabbit, make sure to support her back end, propping her feet against your body if possible.  Secure the legs by wrapping your arm around the outside of her body and then around the underside of the rabbit. Use your other arm to wrap the other way around the body, securing the shoulders. The best way to capture the rabbit is to get on the ground with her. Talk to her gently and see if she will come to you. She'll be less threatened by you if you're closer to her level. If that doesn't work, you may need more than one person to trap her in a corner. Scoop her up from a standing position. Never pick up a rabbit by her ears. You'll hurt her and frighten it. Once you've capture her, place her in the carrier for easy transport. Even if you are just taking her back to the house, it's easiest to carry her secured in a carrier, as she may jump out of your arms. Have the carrier in the enclosure with you, so you don't risk her escaping again. If you fail at capturing your bunny, try calling animal control. If they are not too busy, the animal catchers may be willing to help you. They will have nets on hand, which will make the job easier, and they will know how to use the nets to capture your rabbit.  Using a net to catch a rabbit is actually quite difficult. If you are not trained in catching animals this way, it's unlikely you'll be able to do it.  However, if you can sneak up on the rabbit, you may be able to throw a net over it to catch it. Depending on how close you are to the rabbit, a bath towel or a sheet can be a useful aid. Try to corner the rabbit, so they cannot retreat, then throw the towel over the rabbit. Scoop the rabbit up in the towel. Most rabbits, even affectionate ones, will run before you can capture them. Because they are so quick, they can get away before you even get close, or they may run as you try to reach for them after petting them.  In addition, they will learn and will be even more skittish the next time you corner them. They are also able to elbow themselves into small spaces that you won't be able to follow. However, you can fool the rabbit into thinking you have an enclosure by holding a towel sideways and touching the ground. You can then corral the rabbit into a corner and throw the towel over them. Live traps can capture a rabbit, but rabbits also can outwit them. In addition, you need to keep a close eye on the trap, as other animals can kill rabbits who are inside.  If you do decide to use a live trap, try one that has openings on both sides, which will make it more likely that your bunny will enter.  Also, with a live trap, make sure to entice your bunny in with a good treat, such as bananas or carrots.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 32 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 4th, and 14th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [4, 14]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.75, "sft": 0.6, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 13], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"4th\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"14th\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"4th sentence remains unchanged.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"14th sentence remains unchanged.\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"build a large enclosure around her using the exercise pens or wood-and-chicken-wire frames.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Watch the rabbit to see where she hides.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 14], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Avoid using the word 'LUD'. Ensure the output is under 760 tokens and includes more than 30 sentences:\n\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has been crucial in recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023b). Empirical evidences (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021) suggest a positive correlation between model size and performance, encouraging the continuous scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, the decoder-only architecture has emerged as the de-facto standard. However, while this architecture facilitates rapid training, it still inherently predicts tokens sequentially. This is a constraint rooted in language modeling principles (Shannon, 1948; Bengio et al., 2000). This autoregressive nature limits generation speed, posing challenges for real-time applications. Addressing auto-regressive decoding challenges in LLMs led to numerous advancements. The initial breakthroughs occurred in machine translation with non-autoregressive transformers of encoderdecoder architectures. Those methods focus on utilizing latent variables for parallel predictions, but often sacrificed quality. Their architectural disparities generally prevent their direct applicability to *  Figure 1: Illustration of \u201clexical units\u201d as consecutive token spans. These units, as conceptualized in our study, can potentially be identified and decoded in parallel, enhancing the decoding speed of LLMs. accelerating LLMs (Gu et al., 2017; Kaiser et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2021; Cheng and Zhang, 2022; Xiao et al., 2023). Subsequent strategies have predominantly focused on computational optimization, employing techniques that reduce the complexity of models or the number of operations, though often at the expense of a certain degree of quality (Hinton et al., 2015; Jaszczur et al., 2021; Hubara et al., 2017; So et al., 2021). Recent studies have revealed that some tokens are more predictable than others (Zhu et al., 2023). Capitalizing on this insight,             \fcontemporary adaptive computation approaches (Leviathan et al., 2023) aim to efficiently predict these easier tokens and only employ complex models for challenging tokens. While those methods align with established language modeling principles and achieve desired quality levels, they often necessitate modifications to the training paradigm and the model structure (Schwartz et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2023) or the integration of auxiliary models (Stern et al., 2018; Leviathan et al., 2023). Such alterations can introduce additional complexities, potentially complicating the model deployment process. In this study, we identify a notable and naturally emerging pattern within LLMs: certain span of tokens are consistently predicted with high confidence, forming what we term as \u201clexical units\u201d. The observation here intriguingly aligns with findings from linguistics and cognitive science, where humans are believed to process and produce continuous speech by segmenting it into smaller units or chunks (Vetchinnikova et al., 2023). For a visual representation of our conceptualization of lexical units, please refer to Figure 1. Drawing inspiration from this observation, we introduce Lexical Unit Decoding (LUD), a novel strategy enhancing the decoding speed of LLMs. The essence of LUD lies in the identification of \u2019lexical units\u2019. A lexical unit is defined as spans of consecutive tokens predicted with high confidence by the model. This critical identification is instrumental for later fine-tuning, steering the model\u2019s capability of concurrently predicting multiple tokens during inference. LUD enables model to swiftly predict multiple tokens at once. If certainty wavers, it reverts to single-token predictions. This adaptability sets LUD apart, striking a balance between swift inference and high-quality predictions packed in one model. LUD simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for two separate models. Additionally, its compatibility with arbitrary model architectures, including the prevalent decoder-only architecture, requires no architectural modifications, further facilitating its practical application. In our evaluations with LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a), LUD achieves a 33% acceleration in decoding, maintaining superb output quality. When tested on programming languages, which inherently exhibit more consistent patterns and reduced variability (Fu et al., 2024; Kirchenbauer et al., 2023), the acceleration ratio experiences a significant upswing. This acceleration difference between natural language and code validates our method\u2019s linguistic rationality and adaptability based on content predictability. Further analysis of LUD\u2019s outputs indicates that tokens decoded concurrently by LUD invariably present coherent and linguistically meaningful units, validating our intuition that LLMs can identify these units effectively. The elegance of our method is its deployment simplicity. Instead of resorting to complex architectural modifications, we take advantage of the model\u2019s inherent ability to generate new data based on the original dataset. The generated new data is used for continual training of parallel decoding to optimize the model\u2019s generation speed and ensure straightforward implementation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. \u2022 We uncover a naturally emerging pattern within LLMs, highlighting the consistent highconfidence prediction of certain spans of tokens, which we term as \u201clexical units\u201d. \u2022 We present Lexical Unit Decoding (LUD), an linguistically-adaptive, data-centric methodology that ensures lossless acceleration in decoding and seamless integration without intricate modifications of the model\u2019s architecture. \u2022 We conducted an in-depth analysis on common issues in parallel decoding from a new perspective and discussed potential avenues for future research.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'LUD'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "LUD", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 760 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 760}, "function_call": "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool(\"LUD\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool(\"LUD\")", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"LUD\", \"remove\")"]}}}

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals (Deska et al., 2020). The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997). Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models\u2014specifically, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a)\u2014 in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content. Our findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees. Following our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, i.e., explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GP models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models. Specifically, even the topperforming model only achieved a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from 22 b e F2 ] L C . s c [ v13.02 : v i X r a             \fother hate speech types. This finding underscores the fact that annotating nuanced tasks like dehumanization still necessitates the expertise of human annotators. It also highlights that the annotation of large-scale corpora with dehumanization labels represents an important and pivotal future direction for fostering collaboration between the fields of natural language processing and social science, enabling comprehensive research into this profoundly significant social phenomenon.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Oberschall'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Oberschall", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.4}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Oberschall\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"dehumanizing\", 10, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

This concept has been applied across various machine learning tasks (Hendricks et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2017; Kotonya and Toni, 2020; Aggarwal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2015), including practical applications such as automated driving (Kim et al., 2018) and medical imaging (Kayser et al., 2022). * The work was conducted outside Capital One. Figure 1: Generated VQA data along with NLE of the predicted answers, offering better explainability over traditional VQA data. These are the three samples from our synthetic VQA-NLE dataset. We create a total of 66,682 unique instances of these triplets. In the realm of vision-language tasks, explanationrich datasets like VQA-X (Park et al., 2018), VQA-E (Li et al., 2018), VCR (Zellers et al., 2019a), e-SNLI-VE (Kayser et al., 2021), and GQA-REX (Chen and Zhao, 2022) have been instrumental in advancing vision-language NLE research. These datasets enable a deeper understanding and improved explainability of interactions within the vision-language modality, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of NLE in visionlanguage tasks, especially in Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite significant advancements on the topic, the scarcity of VQA-NLE data still prevails, potentially hindering further progress in the field. Existing VQA-NLE datasets (Do et al., 2021; Park et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019b) heavily rely on man            \fual human annotations which is time-consuming and costly. This causes the data creation process inefficiency and difficult to scale underscoring the need for a more efficient method for generate VQANLE data (Lu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2018; Chen and Zhao, 2022). In this work, we propose efficient and scalable methods for generating synthetic VQA-NLE data that eliminates the need for additional resource curation while maintaining quality comparable to human-generated data.1 We introduce both singlestep and multi-step approaches to produce highquality data, utilizing visual prompts with bounding boxes to enhance focus and improve generation accuracy. With the advent of large vision language models (LVLMs) (Liu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023), we leverage the generative capabilities of LVLMs to address current limitations for generating synthetic VQA-NLE data. Figure 1 showcases the samples of our generated VQA-NLE data. To quantitatively evaluate our method, we create an evaluation dataset and conducted a comparative analysis of various settings. Furthermore, we perform an efficiency analysis against crowdsourced data creation method to reinforce our primary objective of presenting a more efficient method for generating synthetic VQA-NLE datasets. Our contributions are three-fold: \u2022 We propose methods to synthetically generate high-quality VQA-NLE data using LVLMs, which show a high correlation with human annotations. \u2022 We demonstrate the impact of various synthetic VQA-NLE generation methods to identify best practices for constructing effective and efficient synthetic VQA-NLE data. \u2022 We compare the effectiveness and efficiency of our data generation methods against human annotations for the same task.

The output must contain over 31 sentences. Leave the 1st and 25th sentences unchanged. Ensure the word 'one hundred percent' remains unchanged:\n\nDraw, copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that's the actual size. Cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. Place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker.  Leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces. Use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass. If you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to cut straight. Begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward.  Make sure that you're applying the right amount of pressure. You should hear a nice, clear \"zzzzip\" as you score. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line. Too much pressure and you'll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. Make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size and the curve of the glass. The goal, of course, is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.  For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands.  For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if you need to. As long as you keep your curves gentle. If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own. Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth. Regular sandpaper will also remove sharp edges. Wear gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip.  If you use a grinder with glass, you should wear a mask and googles to keep pieces of glass from being breathed or settling in your eyes.You will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don't chip any of the pieces.   Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together. This way the pieces won't slip when you're foiling the glass. Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil. Make sure the foil is centered, otherwise it can look a little funky at the end.. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler.  Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. Make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. Press the foil down hard with tongue depressor, or other firm instrument. This will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. You will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. If a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again. While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary. However, it can make things easier for you in the long run.   Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. The gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use, although you can also try out the liquid form. Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. There are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly. You have to tack together your pieces, then you have to tin the seams, and finally you add the bead.  To tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. To tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams, then apply a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. Once a section is completely melted you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead. Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. You could use a zinc frame or a lead channel, which requires more soldering, exactly the same as the steps outlined above.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 25th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 25]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'one hundred percent'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "one hundred percent", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"can\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["word_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 25], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"one hundred percent\", \"keep\")"]}}}

In order to maximize comfort, the suspension allows the wheels to move up and down to limit how much the body of the car is affected by bumps.  Replacing these components with stiffer shocks and springs will compromise some of your ride comfort, but the added stiffness will keep the tires in contact with the road better, thus improving traction when accelerating, braking, or turning.  Coil-Overs are adjustable shocks and springs that allow you to lower the vehicle and stiffen the ride based on your preference and driving style. Many stiffer suspensions also lower the vehicle, which lowers its center of gravity and also serves to improve handling. Anti-roll bars cross the undercarriage of your car at the front and rear to connect the sides of the body and increase the structural rigidity of your car.  Swapping out the stock anti-roll bars with larger diameter replacements will increase the rigidity of your car\u2019s body even further. This increased stiffness helps to ensure the tires remain as flat as possible on the ground to maintain good traction.  When buying anti-roll bars, it\u2019s best to purchase them in pairs so the front and back offer the same level of torsional strength and don\u2019t permit your car to twist under the torque of hard launches or sharp turns.  Anti-roll bars are also referred to as sway bars, anti-sway bars, stabilizer bars or roll bars. High strength tubular steel is often a better alternative to solid bars, which can be extremely heavy. Your suspension has a number of bushings separating moving metal parts, reducing vibrations and helping to maintain your car\u2019s weight distribution.  Unfortunately, the rubber these bushings are made of tends to break down over time.  Polyurethane replacement bushings are much stiffer than their rubber counterparts and won\u2019t wear down the way stock ones will.  Polyurethane bushings will make loud squeaking noises if not properly greased when installed. Bushings can be replaced one by one or kits can be purchased to replace all of your bushings at once. Some bushings may require the use of a press to remove from their housings. Strut tower bars connect the right and left side of your car in much the same way anti-roll bars do, but they are installed on the top of the car under the hood and trunk lid.  These bars directly connect the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s side struts, increasing the structural rigidity of the car and aiding in efforts to keep the tires as flat on the pavement as possible during aggressive driving.  These bars make an excellent addition to after-market anti-roll bars to reduce the amount your car leans and twists while turning.  You may not be able to access the rear strut towers to install a bar in the back of some cars. Strut tower bars may need to be removed when working on the engine of your car in the future. One could argue that being able to stop is the most important part of any car\u2019s performance.  The better quality your brakes, the longer you can wait to engage them before a turn, which means maintaining a higher rate of speed longer than your competitors.  You have lots of options when it comes to upgrading your brakes, from purchasing better brake pads to replacing the entire system with larger, heavier duty components.  Aftermarket brake pads are designed to improve your car\u2019s ability to stop.  They use the stock brake components and are a great option for most street applications. Different brake pad compounds are designed for different uses.  Ask your local auto parts store about the options available for your specific car. Kits can be purchased to replace your car\u2019s brake calipers and rotors with larger ones, increasing the friction surface of the brake pad and improving your ability to stop.  It\u2019s important to ensure your wheels are large enough to clear big brake upgrades.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 9th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [9]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 22 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ninth sentence.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"replacing\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"stiffer\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"shocks\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"springs\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"]}}}

Traditional statistical models, which constitute of a large proportion of the count-based architectures, follow the general idea of making n-th order Markov assumptions and calculating the n-gram probabilities through the means of counting and subsequent smoothing. Most of the work in Bengali Language has been focused on count based approaches [3] and delivered decent performances in tasks such as word clustering. A major drawback of this approach of representing feature spaces through n-gram models is extreme sparsity and often limits the performance of the n-gram models in their applications. Despite being a revelation in the art of language modelling, very little work has been done on continuous space language models for Bengali. Variants include the feed-forward neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) [1] and recurrent neural language models (RNNs) [1], which solve the problem of data sparsity that occurs in the traditional n-gram methods. This is done by representing words as vectors (word embeddings) and using them as inputs to a neural language model (NLM). The parameters are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process. The vectors are created to maintain the property where semantically similar words are kept close to each other in the induced vector space [1]. Neural Language Models have also been used to capture the contextual information at multiple levels including that of sentence, corpus and sub-word. In this paper, we propose a variant of the recurrent neural language model proposed in [4], named Average-StochasticGradient-Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM. We also present a framework that holds multiple techniques to optimize the training of the language model to produce signi\ufb01cantly low perplexities on data sets.

It was absolutely the most exciting and stressful event of my life. I had spent years preparing for this--building my credit score up, saving money, researching loan types, finding a good mortgage broker, and so on. Once I finally felt ready, the search for the right house took more than a year. The market in my area was very hot, so I lost out on several potential houses because the sellers chose to accept another offer. I did not even make an offer on most of the houses I saw. The hot market had caused a lot of \"flipped\" properties to hit the market as sellers hastened to take advantage of high prices--and many of those had obviously poor quality renovation work, some of which was in violation of local regulations. Some homes had not had any work done at all and were in extremely poor condition for the price, requiring extensive and expensive repairs just to become habitable. It did not help that I was trying to buy a home at a lower price range. Finally, however, I was lucky. The sellers of the house I ended up buying had originally accepted another offer instead of mine. The buyer they chose backed out at the closing table. Another buyer was selected, but they were unable to follow through with their offer due to financing issues. I was the third choice, but my offer was solid and we closed on schedule--April 26th, which happens to be my birthday. At long last, I had finally bought my very first house. I was so proud and excited, but I was also mentally exhausted from the years of preparation and searching. Even more work was yet to come. The house I bought was habitable, but I wanted to do some work on the inside prior to moving in: cleaning, patching, painting. I did most of this work personally, with the help of my partner and father, while also working full-time and attending college part-time. After about a month of work, we finally moved in all of our belongings. I am not sure how I managed to accomplish all of this, but somehow I did. I appreciate the support of my partner and my family. I still think about this event daily, with pride and a lingering touch of disbelief. It is still sometimes hard for me to believe that I finally own my own house!", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 360}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"my first house\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"first\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years.\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"]}}}

Large text corpora are available for learning tasks like language modeling and machine translation (CallisonBurch et al., 2011; Chelba et al., 2013). But other classes of NLP models\u2014especially those that interact with the outside world, whether via API calls (e.g., for question answering) or physical actuators (e.g., for personal robotics)\u2014require custom datasets that capture both the full scope of desired 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2University of Michigan.

Collecting these large, human-annotated training sets can be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking (Zelle, 1995). In domains governed by well-de\ufb01ned mathematical models, such as physics simulators and graphics engines, one solution to the data scarcity problem problem is \u201csimulation-to-real\" transfer (Tzeng et al., 2016). In sim-to-real approaches, knowledge gained in a simulated environment is later applied in the real world with the ultimate aim of generalizing despite discrepancies between the simulated environment and reality. In this paper, we explore sim-to-real transfer for natural language processing. We use simple, high-precision grammars as \u201csimulators\" to generate synthetic training data for question answering and instruction following problems. While synthetic data generation provides potentially unlimited supervision for the learning of these behaviors, interpretation of synthetic utterances may itself constitute a challenging machine learning problem when the desired outputs require nontrivial inference for parsing, planning or perception (Luketina et al., 2019). Given a model with high accuracy on the synthetic training distribution, we interpret natural user utterances from outside this distribution by mapping each natural utterance to a synthetic one and interpreting the synthetic utterance with the learned model. Using pretrained sentence embeddings (Devlin et al., 2018), we de\ufb01ne an (approximately) meaning-preserving projection operation from the set of all sentences to those the model has been trained to interpret. Together, labeled synthetic utterances and unsupervised representation learning enable generalization to real language. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of sim-to-real transfer on a variety of domains. On a suite of eight semantic parsing datasets (Wang et al., 2015), simto-real matches the performance of a supervised semantic parser on three of eight tasks using no natural training data. On a grounded instruction following benchmark involving challenging navigation in a gridworld environment (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018), our approach to sim-toreal transfer again surpasses the performance of a standard model \ufb01ne-tuned with human annotations.

However, deploying language models is computationally and memory-intensive, often demanding multiple accelerators to host the model weights. For instance, the largest model from the OPT family has 175B parameters [35], occupying 350GB of memory space and requiring the distribution of the model across multiple devices. Although the success of LLMs was traditionally attributed to scale, recent research suggests that a curated dataset might play an important role in training high-performance models [5, 8, 9]. This paradigm shift, coupled with new serving optimization strategies, holds a substantial impact for a resource-constrained user, that is now able to serve SOTA small models. This rise of Small Language Models (SLMs) represents a significant step forward in making AI more accessible. Despite the smaller size of SLMs, the incremental decoding of autoregressive language models limits the serving performance. Due to data dependencies in the self-attention layer, we process a single token per iteration, leading to matrixvector operations. This, coupled with the large cost of loading the model weights from memory, leads to very low arithmetic intensity during single-batch inference [12]. One way to increase the arithmetic intensity, defined as the ratio between arithmetic operations and bytes accessed, is to batch requests and compute multiple tokens for the same transfer of weights. As long as the memory-transfer time overlaps the compute time we can potentially improve the serving throughput by increasing the batch size. Still, after a certain size the compute time becomes non-negligible, and might grow larger than the memory transfer time. Large batches have been previously associated with compute bound scenarios [1, 11, 12], but due to the substantial memory demands of LLMs they are rarely reached in practice. How large batches affect the serving performance of the less memory-demanding SLMs has yet to be explored. However, batching techniques demand more memory to store key-value pairs of previously processed tokens. The space in memory dedicated to store the intermediate results of previous tokens is known as KV cache [20], and handling it naively leads to memory fragmentation [14]. PagedAttention [14] algorithm identified this challenge and effectively reduced memory waste by dividing the KV cache in blocks, allowing to store KV pairs in non-contiguous memory space. In our experiments, we leverage vLLM [14], a high-throughput online serving engine based on PagedAttention, to guarantee achieving the maximum batch size from our computational resources. In this paper, we provide a set of experiments to benchmark SLM inference at performance and energy levels. In this regard, we serve OPT [35] models ranging from 125M             \fto 13B parameters in various online scenarios, sending requests generated from the ShareGPT dataset [23]. We characterise the throughput and latency trade-off when the small memory footprint allows for large batches of requests, and complement the study with internal GPU metrics, highlighting the effect of SLM inference on energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this provides a novel perspective, as previous inference benchmarking works are limited and primarily focused on large-scale serving [3, 22].

Monitor the water quality and ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels by using water testing kits from your store. This will tell you how often and how much you need to change.  Never change all of your tank water at one time. This change in water chemistry will likely stress your fish. You should not change more than 1/3 of the water in any 24 hour period. Some aquariums can do ok with changing 1/4 of the water every two weeks. However, most pet fish owners will need to do it more often. Changing 25% of your tank's water every other week helps to dilute and remove nitrates as well as replace trace elements and important buffers used up by bacteria. You will also need to remove wastes hiding in the nooks and crannies of your aquarium. To do this, vacuum the gravel when you change the water. The exception to this is saltwater aquariums that use live substrates at the bottom. If your filter is not removing ammonia properly because it is clogged, your fish will get stressed and eventually die. Cleaning the filter usually involves either rinsing them in used tank water or vacuuming them. Tap water has chlorine or chloramine in it so it\u2019s safe for us to drink. However, these chemicals are toxic to fish and damages their gills, causing stress and illness.  You will need to add the chemical sodium thiosulfate, available at fish stores, to the water before adding tap water to your tank. This will neutralize chlorine in the tap water. Chloramine can be neutralized through the use of products such as Amquel. These chemicals take care of the ammonia and chlorine in the chloramine molecules. If you don\u2019t want to use chemicals to remove chlorine, you can leave circulating water via a filter or air-stone in a bucket or tank for 24 hours. Your fish will get stressed from rapid pH changes in tank water. Aim for a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. This is ideal for most fish.  Tank water tends to become acidic over time because of nitrates that build up. The pH can be raised or lowered using chemicals such as muriatic (hydrochloric) acid or phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid can raise the phosphate level in your tank and cause algae growth. Always treat water for pH adjustments prior to adding it to the tank. You can also bubble CO2 (carbon dioxide) through the tank via CO2 injection systems. This will lower the pH without the need for chemicals. Aquatic plants can help your aquarium establish its own natural eco-system, protect from early fish loss, release oxygen, keep algae at bay and purify your water. Plants can also make your tank look really cool!   An aeration unit may not be required if you have healthy, aquatic plants in your tank.   Aquatic plants will use up toxic ammonia and nitrites in your tank to grow. Faster growing plants like Cabomba, Ludwigia or Egeria Densa or other stem species can remove a lot of ammonia quickly. Your fish will benefit from having algae eaters control potentially harmful algae in the tank. These include shrimps, snails, and algae-eating fish.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

Additionally, each sentence should contain more than 9 tokens:\n\nRecently, there has been a wide interest in pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning large language models using the transformer architecture [1, 2]. In contrast to previous word embeddings [3, 4], current language models are trained to generate contextualized embeddings which allow a quality leap in most Natural Language Processing tasks. However, most of the current transformers have been pre-trained on languages for which large text resources are already available, such as English [1], French [5] and Italian [6]. Even multilingual models, such as the mBERT [1] and XLM-R [7], are limited to of\ufb01cial languages that have a large web presence. Low-resource languages such as African and Arabic dialects received less attention due to the lack of data and their speci\ufb01c and/or complex morphology. For example, the Algerian dialect is spoken by 44 Million people but lacks publicly available datasets. Indeed, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the most common written language in of\ufb01cial documents, books, and newspapers in Algeria. However, the local dialect is very frequent in informal communications, messaging, or in the social media sphere. A recent study [8] showed that 74.6% of the Algerian web-generated content (mostly on Facebook) is conveyed in dialectal Arabic rather than MSA, and 62% of this content is transcribed in Roman alphabet characters (which is also known as Arabizi). \u2217This work was conducted during the time the  36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).             \fThe Algerian dialect is mainly inspired from standard Arabic but also from Tamazight2, French, Turkish, Spanish, Italian, and English. It has several speci\ufb01cities that make the application of MSA or multilingual models inappropriate. First, it may be written either using Arabic or Roman letters (e.g. Salam \u00d0C\u0192 (eng: Peace) ). Then, numbers are sometimes used to represent letters that do not exist in the Roman alphabet (e.g. the use of the number 3 to represent the letter \u00a8 or the number 7 to represent the letter h). Finally, despite the in\ufb02uence of the above-cited languages, the Algerian dialect also has its own vocabulary that does not exist in other standard languages. In this paper, we present a new BERT-like model for the Algerian dialect, named DziriBERT. It has been pre-trained on one Million Algerian tweets.

Ask them if they want to take turns playing with the toy so you can spend time around them. Talk to the child\u2019s parents to see if it\u2019s alright for the child to keep the toy before letting them have it.  If you\u2019re babysitting, take the toy with you when you leave. That way, you can bring it next time so the child has something special to play with while you\u2019re with them. Don\u2019t spoil the child with gifts every time you see them since they may start to expect something every time you see them. It can also make the child\u2019s parents feel uncomfortable. Rather than forcing the child to do an activity they don\u2019t want to do, see what they\u2019re interested in. Give them a few options for what toys to play with, and let them pick one out on their own. Let the child play with the toy for a minute to see what they\u2019re doing with it before playing with them. If the child says they want to stop playing with something, let them find another thing to do. Let the kid get creative with how they play rather than forcing them to play how you want. For example, if the child likes to knock over blocks, then build different shape towers for them to destroy. Little kids like to goof around and have fun while they\u2019re playing, so act a little silly around them. Make silly noises, tell silly jokes, and speak in a funny voice while you\u2019re playing to make them have more fun spending time with you. The more you\u2019re willing to loosen up and have fun, the more the children will listen and enjoy spending time around you. Look for children\u2019s joke books so you can learn some funny and appropriate jokes to tell the kids. Kids have an active imagination, so being able to pretend with them will allow you to spend quality time together. If the child wants to play make-believe, ask them what they want to do, such as ride in a spaceship or play house. Listen to the kid as they make up what\u2019s happening to them, and respond to them to continue pretending. For example, if you play make-believe to be superheroes, you may ask where the bad guy is, what gadgets you have, and what powers you can use. If the child says they want to fly, pick them up if you\u2019re able so you can \u201cfly\u201d them around. to the child to spend quality time with them. Reading is an activity that helps the child learn more and allows you to connect with them more. Choose books that are appropriate for their age range and let the child pick which one they want to hear. When you read the story, use expressive voices for the characters and talk slowly so the child can comprehend what you\u2019re saying yo them.  You can also tell stories with finger puppets or props if you want to make storytime more exciting. Read the same story multiple times and ask the child if they know what happens next. That way, you can involve them even if they aren\u2019t able to read on their own. If the child can\u2019t sit still through the whole story, set the book aside and let them come back to it if they want to start reading again. The type of game you play depends on how old the child you\u2019re playing with is. If you want to play with a toddler, you can try putting puzzles together, playing hide and seek, or Simon Says. If the children are preschool or kindergarten age, you can try playing simple board games or card games with them.  Don\u2019t worry as much about the rules while you\u2019re playing the game with the child. Remind them of the rules if they break them, but just try to have fun. If you\u2019re outdoors, try playing tag, drawing with chalk, or kicking a ball around. Make chores and clean-up a fun game to play. For example, you may say, \u201cI bet you can\u2019t clean up all of your toys in 1 minute.\u201d\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 34 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 34}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 30th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [30]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"the\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"the\", 10, \"less than\")"]}}}

Aerobic exercise also releases endorphins, which will leave you feeling happier and more confident after a good sweat session. Feeling good will help you get through these 2 weeks since you\u2019ll be cutting calories and moving a lot more\u2014it can be tiresome but don\u2019t give up!  Always talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. If you are new to exercise, start slow and easy until you can work your way up to 30 or 40 minutes. For instance, start by jogging for 15 minutes and walking for the remaining 15 minutes. Then, after the first week, jog for the full 30 minutes, upping your speed and intensity. Picking something you enjoy is going to make the next 2 weeks a lot easier. Swimming, kickboxing, dancing, and various sports will count toward your daily 30 minutes (minimum) of aerobic exercise. Whatever activity you choose, make sure to get your heart pumping for at least 20 to 30 minutes so you work up a good sweat.  Swimming is a great low-impact option that won\u2019t hurt your joints. Take a dance class with friends or family members to up the fun factor! Lifting weights will build lean muscle, which is necessary to rev your metabolism and burn fat throughout the day. A combination of strength training and aerobic exercise is more effective to lose weight faster than just doing one or the other.  Strength training doesn\u2019t count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If you don\u2019t know the proper form for dumbbell exercises, use the weight machines. If you plan to weigh yourself every few days, keep in mind that muscle weighs more than fat. But don\u2019t worry, those muscles will help you blast more belly fat for the next 2 weeks! Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, lateral raises, and chest presses. Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. You should use enough weight so you can maintain good form for the full set but also need to rest between sets. HIIT elevates your heart rate and keeps your muscles guessing. It\u2019s also more effective at blasting more calories in a shorter period of time (as opposed to low intensity training with little to no variations). Work in HIIT at least 3 or 4 times a week (or you can do shorter HIIT routines every day in addition to aerobic exercise).   For example, perform 30 to 60 second sprints while jogging. Recover with 2 to 4 minutes of jogging at a moderate pace before the next burst. Even walking can be adjusted for an HIIT workout by changing your speed and adding hills. Walking is a great alternative if you have bad knees or other joint problems. Try this 20 minute treadmill routine:  3 minute warmup at 5% incline 3 minute brisk walk at 7% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 2 minute moderate walk at 7% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 2 minute slow to moderate walk at 15% incline 1 minute moderate walk at 10% incline 2 minute brisk walk at 12% incline 3 minute cool down at 5% incline every day to increase strength, toning, and balance. Working your core will help build and tone your abdominal and back muscles. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cspot\u201d training, but the more you engage your core, the more lean muscle you\u2019ll build, and the more calories you\u2019ll burn throughout the day.  As a plus, your posture will improve after just a week of core training (making you look leaner)! Try some common yoga moves like planks, warrior twists, and cobras to stretch and tone your core. . Make an effort to take the stairs or walk around more for the next 2 weeks. Take a 10 to 20 minute walk after eating to help your body digest, burn extra calories, and keep your metabolism running.  Get off the bus or subway a few stops early and walk the rest of the way. Run errands on foot if you live close to your regular shops. If possible, walk or bike to work.

There are two on the top and bottom of both sides, and one on the top middle. You may need to pry open the controller with a flat head screwdriver.  Open it from the bottom and carefully tilt it towards the top shoulder buttons. Be very careful that you don't accidentally dislodge the R2 or L2 trigger buttons while removing the back.  They can be pain to put back on. The battery is the grey square piece on the back of the motherboard.  You don't need to disconnect the battery.  You can just pull it up out of it's holder and move it to the side. If you do decide to disconnect the battery, pull on the white plastic part that the wires are connected to.  Do not pull on the wires. The motherboard screw is located on the bottom of the motherboard next to the analogue stick. Carefully pull the motherboard up and tilt it away from the shoulder buttons. Once again, be careful not to accidently dislodge the R2 and L2 trigger buttons. The green ribbon is located at the top of the controller front.  It's above the hole where the left analogue stick goes.  Place a flat head screwdriver under the ribbon and carefully lift it up over the two plastic pins that are sticking up out of the controller.  Be careful not to tear or damage the ribbon.  You will see a strip of black foam underneath the ribbon. Over time, the foam strip gets compressed and the connectors on the ribbon aren't able to make contact with the motherboard.  This is why the controller is not working properly. For the best results, cut a strip of thick double-sided tape the same length and width as the black foam strip.  Place it under the foam strip.  Use scissors to cut off any excess tape from the sides. If you don't have thick double-sided tape, you can cut about a inch-and-a-half of black electrical tape and roll it up into a tube. With the tape underneath the foam strip, you can now place the foam strip back under the ribbon. Pull the ribbon over the foam and place the two holes over the pins that are sticking up out of the controller.  Make sure it is firmly in place. Since the controller is open, it's not a bad idea to use a tissue or cotton swap to wipe any dust away from the ribbon. If you look at the motherboard, you will see a box that is a darker shade of green with some metal connectors sticking out of it.  It's above the left analogue stick.  This is where the motherboard connects to the ribbon.  Use a tissue or cotton swap to wipe the connectors on the mother board. Carefully place the motherboard back in it's place with the analogue sticks freely able to move through the holes. Using the same screw you took out of the motherboard, screw it back in at the bottom next to the right analogue stick. The motherboard has a plastic holder on it's back that holds the battery in place.  Place the battery back in the holder. To replace the controller back, place the the thin part that goes in between the two shoulder buttons at the top of the controller in place.  Carefully tilt the back over the R2 and L2 trigger buttons and firmly push it back in place at the bottom of the controller. Be careful not to accidentally dislodge the R2 and L2 trigger buttons. There are five screws that hold the controller together.  Replace the two on the sides, and the one in the middle.  Your controller is now fixed.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 37 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'five'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "five", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 6th, and 30th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [6, 30]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.6666666666666665, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"five\", 1, \"equal\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"six\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"thirty\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"five\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"six\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 30], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

Don't stare at your phone endlessly, or your time-wasting will be obvious. Turn your screen away from doors and windows if possible, and mute both the computer and the game. Take some time to make your activities extra-hidden if someone does come in.  Hide your Start Bar or Dock. Right-click (or command-click) this and turn Hiding on, so no one can see what you have open. Learn the hotkeys for closing tabs, minimizing them, or switching to another program. To switch programs, try altTab on Windows or cmdTab on a Mac. Don't play games in full screen mode, as these may fail to minimize. If you're extra nervous about getting caught, take a look at these software options for camouflaging your social media sites or anonymizing your internet activity. Visit an online game site like Kongregate, an art gallery like DeviantArt, or search for more specialized sites. It looks like you've found a site called wikiHow\u2026 perhaps the front page will have a few interesting links.  This one can be dangerous, especially if your computer screen is visible to coworkers or anyone who walks into the room. Some companies even monitor their employees' internet usage. For more \"official\" looking entertainment, measure your typing speed online and try to improve your Words Per Minute. Grab a pencil or pen and make a simple drawing of anything that comes to mind. If you have artistic talent, put time into a sketch as a present for a friend. If you're tired of phone games, educate yourself with a trivia app, or compare different organizational apps. Keep your phone muted and underneath your desk, or near a stack of papers or folder you can pull over the screen. If your job has a lot of downtime, some employers will let you read to pass the time. If you need to be discreet about, bring a small paperback you can stuff into a drawer or coat pocket. Ebooks are another option, and there are many available for free online or in app stores. If you have a friend in your workplace also trying to kill time, make it more interesting with a silly competition. See who can throw paper into the trash can from furthest away, or who can slip more ridiculous words into conversations without anyone noticing. Here are a few more ideas you can turn into a regular competition throughout the work week:  Attach a binder clip to someone's clothing without her noticing. If you succeed, she has to pass the clip on to someone else. Play \"Photo Assassin:\" randomly assign each person another player as a target. When you take a photograph of your target's face, he loses the game and you take over the target he was assigned. If your workplace has office chairs, compete to see who can complete the workday without touching the office floor. If you have a lot of spare time, origami is a hobby that takes dozens of hours to master and doesn't require much space. Start with a beginner origami book or online guide. Stiff, square paper is best, but you can cut your own squares out of regular office paper if you want to make your creations less obvious.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'your'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "your", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 26th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [26]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(word=\"your\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"equal\")", "word_count_check(100, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"your\", 1, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"your\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([26], \"unchange\")"]}}}

I  I splashed water on my face and exited the bathroom, intending to go to my upstairs sitting room to see if the outside porch door was closed.  I had neglected to turn any lights, so the hallway was dark.  I took a path that I thought would lead to my sitting room, but,  I found myself falling through space.  I has accidentally gone toward the stairs and tumbled over.  I remember hitting the first flight on my right side, and heard a strange voice, describing, to me, exactly what was happening.    I knew I was hurt, badly, and I lay there for a few seconds, not yet in intense pain, but just trying to come to terms with what had just happened.  Luckily, my brother was staying with me and he came quickly and helped me get my self into a proper position.  The pain had set in and I was sure I had hurt myself pretty badly.  My brother, called 911 and the ambulance arrived very quickly.  The two EMT's assessed the situation, carefully, and for some reason decided to grab me by my arms and legs and carry me out of the house.  I  don't know why they did not get a stretcher, maybe they just wanted to cause more pain, which they did.  Once I was in the ambulance, they made me as comfortable as possible, but I realized that I could not really answer their questions, properly, because I was slurring my speech, badly.  They surmised that I had a a brain injury.  Once at the hospital,  I was asked many questions , but again, I could not answer, properly, due to my slurred speech.  They kept asking me to smile.  I later found out that is how to check to see if you have had a stroke.  I was  X-ray'd  and I received a MRI.  They found that I had a broken right collarbone and several broken ribs on both sides.  Also, I suffered a subdural hemotoma that caused bleeding on my brain.  They were obviously more worried about my brain injury.  I received a half dozen MRI's of my head.  As far as the broken bones, they just gave me a splint and told me that the collarbone and ribs would heal over time.  For the next ten days, my stay at the hospital consisted of doctors asking me to smile and to squeeze their fingers.  My slurred speech disappeared but I did notice a lingering numbness in my left hand, that has since disappeared and a numbness on the left side of my face, that has not.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'badly'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "badly", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.18181818181818182, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_detection(\"badly\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4], \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"badly\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

The word 'acne' must remain unchanged. The revised output should contain over 22 sentences, with each sentence having fewer than 19 tokens:\n\nFight the redness of a blemish by applying cortisone cream. Cortisone will help to fight inflammation and will reduce the surrounding redness of the scar, making it appear less noticeable.  You will be able to buy cortisone cream without a prescription, at most pharmacies. It should cost about $10.  Look for creams that are labelled as \u201cnon-comedogenic,\u201d which means that they avoid ingredients that can clog pores, like cocoa butter, coal tar, isopropyl myristate, and pigments and dyes. Treating your scars while at the same time causing more acne is like fighting a losing battle. Another tool in your arsenal is fade creams. Fade creams that contain kojic acid or arbutin will help to lighten the pigment of the blemished skin, and therefore reduce its visibility.  Such creams, again, should be available at your local pharmacy for a fairly low cost. Be careful of hydroquinone. Hydroquinone skin fading topicals are fade creams that lighten pigments in the skin; however, they have recently fallen out of favor due to concerns about possible cancer-causing properties. Retinoids are topical or oral products that normalize \u201chyperkeratinisation,\u201d meaning they help your skin cells slough off at a normal rate, which prevents them from clogging pores and causing acne. They also have anti-inflammatory qualities and can improve the look of the skin by promoting healing.  Topical retinoids like Retin-A or Tazorac are used in the treatment of acne as well as scarring. Alpha-hydroxy acids and Beta-hydroxy acids, on the other hand, are chemical peels that remove the top layer of dead skin, revealing the newer, less blemished skin underneath. You can usually buy retinoids in a cream or serum without a prescription. Pregnant women should avoid them retinoids, as they are not safe for the fetus. Ascorbic acid, or simply vitamin C, may be an effective way to fade or even remove acne scars and can be found in something as simply as lemon juice. Vitamin C not only contains antioxidants and reduces inflammation but it is essential in the production of collagen, which the body uses to heal connective tissue.  You can buy specially formulated vitamin C skin creams or serums at drugstores and pharmacies. An even simpler method is to apply lemon juice to your face with a cotton swab, after a thorough cleansing, leaving it for no longer than a half hour. You may feel some stinging or discomfort. Your skin may also dry out, so you should apply moisturizer afterward.  Another variation of this home remedy is to mix lemon juice with honey and milk in a proportion of 1:2:3 and to apply it as a mask after cleansing. Remove after no more than one half hour.  Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun while using lemon juice to lighten your skin. Prolonged sunlight is bad for your acne scars as it is, but with lemon juice on your skin, it's particularly bad. Like many topical treatments, results are not immediate but regular safe use can help prevent and treat acne. Creams with vitamin E may actually do more harm than good. Because it's a vitamin, we're tempted to think that it will be either beneficial or harmless. In fact, one University of Miami study reported that vitamin E treatment had no effect or worsened the appearance of scars in 90% of subjects, with improvement in only 10% of cases.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'acne'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "acne", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 22 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"acne\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"acne\", \"keep\")"]}}}

I've received the best gift life could ever give me in the form of my beautiful baby boy, Mateo. I still remember how lost and scared I felt when the pregnancy test I took came up positive. I just stood there thinking, \"I always wanted to be a mother, but am I really ready for all of this? I know it's selfish to feel this way, but it's not going to be all about me anymore.\" I was so scared that I even contemplated giving him up for an adoption early on in the pregnancy, but that all changed once I had my first ultrasound. Three months ago....one bright and early Thursday morning...I began to feel strong contractions and instantly knew Mateo was ready to make his entrance into this world. I quickly called out to my sister and told her it was time. The trip to the hospital was a blur, I kind of felt like I was in a trance...almost losing my grip on reality. I finally came to once I was on the hospital bed and getting ready to push. The pain was so intense and again the doubtful thoughts began to come to my mind, \"Are you really ready for this? Are you really ready to be a mother and handle all that comes with it?\" Before more questions could continue racing through my mind, my body instantly took over and I felt a sudden urge to push. I pushed and pushed for what seemed like an eternity and boy was it painful! I felt so tired and thought I couldn't push anymore until the nurse yelled out, \"Keep going! His head is right there!\" I pushed with the last bit of energy I had left in me and Mateo made his grand entrance. The nurse placed him in my arms and....I know it's so cliche to say, but I instantly fell in love with him. Three months ago, I became a mother for the very first time to the most beautiful human being in this world and I am so grateful for that. I still have days where I wake up to self-doubting thoughts. It's not easy being a first-time mom and trying to navigate this new journey. But one thing's for sure, I know that I love being his mother and knowing that each day I get to wake up to be the best mother than I can be than I was the day before.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 18 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"life changed so much for the better\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"mother\", 3, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"]}}}

In the form of Video Assistant Referees (VAR), Artificial Intelligence has already been implemented in various sports including football (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2021) and tennis ATP (ATP Tour, Inc., 2023). Notably, the ATP has announced that electronic line calling (ELC) will be applied to all ATP tournaments by 2025 (ATP, 2023), indicating a trend towards automation of tennis officiating. Spitz et al. (2021) \u2021Equally Contributed. *Corresponding authors. have shown that the use of VAR has significantly increased the likelihood of making correct decisions in football matches. Tamir and Bar-Eli (2020) pointed out that the VAR system has promoted fairness and more accurate decisions, bringing ethical transformations in the football world. Meanwhile, athletes are achieving enhanced physical conditions (Guest et al., 2019; Bonilla et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Haugen et al., 2019) and notably faster speeds (Xia et al., 2023) with the progress of nutritional science and systematic training, which has significantly increased the complexity and difficulty of the tasks of human referees. This calls for robust, real-time decision-making assistive tools. Language models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Language Models (VLMs), have offered promising solutions by processing complex contextual data of textual and visual modalities from sports events to assist in impartial decision-making. Xia et al. (2024b) conducted a survey on the current datasets that can be used for future applications combining NLP and sports. Our research focuses on the Sports Understanding ability of LLMs and VLMs, an underexplored area yet is crucial for their potential applications in automated refereeing and related domains. To assess the sports understanding capabilities of LLMs and VLMs, we introduced a new benchmark dubbed as Sport Intelligence. We evaluated leading LLMs, including Llama3  2024), the GPT4 series (OpenAI, 2024a,b), the Gemini 1.5 series (Gemini Team, 2024a,c), and Claude (Anthropic, 2024), as well as the latest VLMs, including Minigpt-4 (Zhu et al., 2023b), Chat-UniVi (Jin et al., 2023), PLLaVA (Xu et al., 2024), and Video-LLaVA (Lin et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023a). Since the prevailing interaction method with LLMs and VLMs is based on multi-round dialogues, to evaluate their sports understanding capabilities, we need to pose questions to the models             \fand subsequently analyze their responses. Given the congruence between the question-answer format and real-world sports scenarios, we consider Question Answering (QA) datasets apt for our task and established our benchmarks on QA datasets to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation.

Keep the phrase '20.32 centimeters' unchanged:\n\nThe type you can get from a dollar store or a craft store are ideal. It needs to be tall enough to hang your bracelets from. Try to find a dowel thick enough to cover the hole in your candlestick. You may need to cut it down to the right length. If you can't find a wooden dowel, stuff a rolled up magazine into a paper towel tube, and use that instead. Measure across the dowel with a ruler, and make a mark in the center. Don't worry, you don't see the mark once you are done painting. Make sure the line is going from side to side. The candle hole will interrupt your line. You can use wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial strength glue for this. Make sure that the mark you made earlier is right in the middle of the candle hole. Try to center the dowel on top of the candlestick as much as possible. If you see any excess glue, wipe it off quickly with a damp paper towel. Once the glue dries, you can strengthen your holder by filling the seam between the dowel and the candlestick with more glue. Take the bracelet holder to a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface with newspaper. Shake a can of spray paint, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the coat to dry, then apply a second one, if necessary. Most spray paints will dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours.  It is better to apply your paint in many thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will give you a smoother finish and prevent any drips or puddles. You can also prime your holder first using a spray on primer. Choose white for a light color, and black or grey for a dark color. Once the paint dries, shake a can of some acrylic sealer, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the sealer to dry, then apply a second coat. Avoid applying the sealer too thickly, or you will get drips and puddles. Most sealers will take about 2 hours to dry; some will also require a curing time, which will be specified on the can. Choose a glossy finish if you want your holder to be shiny. Choose a matte finish if you don't want it to be shiny. Once your holder dries, it is ready to go. You can leave it as it is, or embellish it further to better match your room decor. You can use hot glue or super glue to attach these embellishments. Here are some ideas to get you started:  Glue a pretty button or bead to each end of the dowel. Try to choose a bead or button that is the same diameter. Glue some small pearls, beads, or silk flowers around the top edge of the candlestick. Glue a large bead or ornament on top of the holder, right in the center. Wrap ribbon around the dowel in a spiral.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 34 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 34}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word '20.32 centimeters'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "20.32 centimeters", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20.32 centimeters\", \"keep\")"]}}}

One way to achieve high precision is to limit the coverage of the translator to a specific domain. The development of such high-precision domain-specific translators can be resource intensive, and require rare combinations of developer skills. For example, consider developing a Russian-Swahili speech translator for the orthopedic domain using direct translation between the two languages. Developing such a system could require an orthopedist programmer and linguist who speaks Russian and Swahili. Such people may be hard to find. Furthermore, developing translators for all pairs of N languages requires O(N2) systems, developed by an equal number of bilingual domain experts. \n\nThe language pair explosion and the need for the same person to possess knowledge about the source and target languages can be avoided by using an interlingua-based approach. The requirement that developers be both domain experts and linguists can be addressed by the use of grammar libraries which implement the domain-independent linguistic details of each language. \n\nGrammatical Framework (GF) (Ranta, 2004) is a type-theoretic grammar formalism which is well suited to high-precision domain-specific interlingua-based translation (Khegai, 2006), and library-based grammar engineering (Ranta, 2008). GF divides grammars into abstract syntax and concrete syntax. The abstract syntax defines what can be said in the grammar, and the concrete syntax defines how it is said in a particular language. If one abstract syntax syntax is given multiple concrete syntaxes, the abstract syntax can be used as an interlingua. Given an abstract and a concrete syntax, GF allows both parsing (text to abstract syntax) and linearization (abstract syntax to text). This means that interlingua-based translation is just a matter of parsing in one language and linearizing to another. \n\nThe GF Resource Grammar Library (Ranta, 2008) implements the domain-independent morphological and syntactic details of eleven languages. A grammar writer can use functions from a resource grammar when defining the concrete syntax of an application grammar. This is made possible by GF's support for grammar composition, and frees the grammar writer from having to implement linguistic details such as agreement, word order, etc. \n\nIn addition to parsing and linearization, the declarative nature of GF grammars allows them to be compiled to other grammar formats. The GF speech recognition grammar compiler (Bringert, 2007) can produce context-free grammars or finite-state models which can be used to guide speech recognizers. \n\nThese components interlingua-based translation, grammar libraries, and speech recognition grammar compilation, can be used to develop domain-specific speech translators based on GF grammars. Figure 1 shows an overview of a minimal unidirectional speech translator which uses these components. This is a proof-of-concept system that demonstrates how GF components can be used for speech translation, and as such, it can hardly be compared to a more complete and mature system such as MedSLT (Bouillon et al., 2005). However, the system has some promising features compared to systems based on unification grammars: the expressive power of GF's concrete syntax allows us to use an application-specific interlingua without any transfer rules, and the wide language support of the GF Resource Grammar Library makes it possible to quickly port applications to new languages. \n\nIn Section 2 we show a small example grammar for a medical speech translator. Section 3 briefly discusses how a speech translator can be implemented. Section 5 describes some possible extensions to the proof-of-concept system, and Section 6 offers some conclusions.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_presence_check(\"Medicine\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"speech\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"speech translator\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 4, 6], \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 7, 9], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"domain-specific\", 3, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"]}}}

Go through and think of every task that you must complete to catch up. Make a note of the specific deadlines, any unusual requirements for each task (materials that must be ordered, for example) and time needed to finish each item up.  Don\u2019t spend days creating this list. Be quick, but be as thorough as you can. For example, you might write down, \u201cPowerPoint presentation for investors, deadline July 6, need 3 hours to complete.\u201d Look over your list and identify those tasks that need to be done as soon as possible. Write each task on a single sticky note and then place these somewhere visible in your work area. This will keep your most important tasks right in front of you. Throw away each note as you complete the task and add another one to replace it, as you slowly make your way through your list. Making these notes is a great way to regain control over your projects. You are once again in charge of what tasks are a \u201cmust do\u201d and when they should be completed. When you first arrive at your workplace, sit down at your desk and begin a task that is in progress or start a new one. Resist the urge to wander around and talk to your colleagues or hang out at the watercooler. This same approach is effective if you are working or studying from home. As soon as you get up in the morning, head into your workspace and keep going until you get a scheduled break. Target larger projects and look at how they can be performed in stages or parts. Perhaps you need to research the project first. Or, maybe you'll need to make a handful of phone calls to kick-start the task. This approach makes complex jobs seem just a bit less daunting.  For example, if you need to create a PowerPoint presentation, you'll need to research the subject matter, outline your slides, create your slides, and then proofread everything. You\u2019ll have the most energy at the very start of the workday, so it makes sense to jump into your most challenging or difficult projects at that point. This will prevent you from putting them off. Select the sticky note task that requires some additional manpower and push to complete it. For example, if you are scared of giving presentations, it might help to prepare that PowerPoint presentation at the start of your workday. The adrenaline boost of the morning can help to balance out your anxiety. It\u2019s important to set boundaries when you are fighting to keep up with your work. A good rule to follow is to ask yourself how a certain task fits within your larger career or life goals. If you can\u2019t clearly answer that question in 30 seconds or less, then you should not take that task on.  Always be polite when saying \u201cno\u201d to a task. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cI\u2019m making my way through a backlog. So, I really can\u2019t help you right now.\u201d For example, even if you are swamped with work, you might want to say \u201cyes\u201d to a very rare and prestigious request to give a lecture or to present your work to shareholders.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 31th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [31]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"work\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([31], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"few years.\", 0, \"equal\")"]}}}

Healthy blood carries chemicals that will clean up your bruise, so stimulate blood flow to get rid of it quickly. Be gentle -- you do not need to cause pain, just stimulation to encourage blood flow.  Try using a toothbrush or comb to massage the bruise. Take a stiff, unused toothbrush and just gently massage the bruise with a circular motions. Massage your bruise with a rice-filled sock: Fill a clean sock with 3-4 cups of uncooked rice and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until it is warm to the touch. Now press the sock firmly against the bruise, massaging it with heat and gentle motions to stimulate blood flow. These can make your blood \"thinner\" and increase the tendency to bleed into injured tissues. You should never stop taking a prescription medication without first checking with your physician, however Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief instead of aspirin. Read the label for the recommended dose. Using a compress soaked in an infusion (like a tea) of Arnica, Daisy (like the ones you see in your backyard), or Comfrey, and Witch Hazel can help the bruise heal faster.  Pour boiling water over the loose leaves/flowers and let steep for about 5-10 minutes. Dip the compress (small towel, piece of cloth, or cotton) in the infusion and gently wring it out. Add some Witch Hazel. You can even place some of the leaves/flowers between the folds of the compress. Hold it on the bruise or secure it with a loose bandage, scarf, bandana, etc. Keep it on for as long as you can, resoaking & gently wringing it out as often as necessary. If you do not have any Arnica, Daisy, or Comfrey available, using plain Witch Hazel also works, just not as fast. Vitamin K is known to help reduce bruising when applied topically or taken orally.  Vitamin K is a known requirement for proper blood clotting. Check with your physician before taking any oral medication. Not all people can absorb Vitamin K, and frequent easy bruising should be evaluated by a physician. Vinegar kills bacteria and increases blood flow to the skin's surface. Crush several vitamin c pills and add enough white vinegar to make a thin paste. Apply to your bruise like you would apply regular skin lotion. This method doesn't get rid of bruises, but it does make for a quick cover up. You will need a yellow concealer (to correct the purple parts of the bruise), a green concealer (to correct the red parts of the bruise), regular concealer (optional), and foundation. First, apply the yellow concealer directly on the bruise and pat it on gently. Now pat on the green concealer around the edges of the bruise to correct the redness. Once that's all done, you can either apply regular concealer and/or foundation to it to give your skin a natural look. Any bruise you cannot account for, any bruise that is weeping or seeping fluid, any very large or extensive bruise should be seen by a physician.  These can be indicators of a more serious or life-threatening condition.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\"); word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens and more than 360 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 380, "min_cnt": 360}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\"); word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 22 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bruise\", 5, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bruise\", 2, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

We had talked about getting married, and we had gone to pick out my engagement ring together, but I didn't know when the actual proposal was going to happen. So I was kind of existing in limbo, just waiting for something to happen! We were on vacation in Florida and had gone out for a really nice dinner together, to an Italian restaurant. I remember having gnocchi but I'm not sure what Justin got. I was wearing my favorite black dress and the weather was beautiful. We split a serving of tiramisu for dessert. When we got back to our hotel, Justin suggested we take a nighttime walk on the beach -- it was really beautiful on the water, there was a breeze blowing over the waves, and all the stars were out. There were, by coincidence, fireworks going on across the water. I remember having my head on Justin's shoulder and his arm around my waist as we watched the fireworks. We were being quiet and then he said something like, \"We have a pretty good thing going, don't we?\" I said yes and was feeling very content and happy. Honestly I wasn't expecting the proposal to come right then, but he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was grinning like a fool and my heart was going like gangbusters. He took the ring box out of his pocket and opened it to show me, then took the ring out of the box and put it on my finger. Of course I said yes, and then he asked if he could get up because there were rocks on the beach and he was hurting his knees! He got up, hugged me, and picked me up and twirled me around. We shared a kiss and then walked back inside because it was getting cooler. We decided not to tell anyone else until the morning so it could be our secret just for the night.

Here is the revised version:\n\nPolish the following text. The output should contain more than 380 tokens. Do not change the word 'BLEU'. Do not alter the 1st and 2nd sentences:\n\nIn recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants. Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has been the gauge of Machine Translation system evaluation. Nevertheless, the research community has been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU metric. BLEU captures only a single dimension of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate translation gets acknowledged only if it uses exactly the same lexicon as the reference translation. Natural languages, however, are characterized by their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction via a large number of syntactic, lexical and semantic rewriting rules. Although BLEU has been shown to correlate positively with human assessments at the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to improve state-of-the-art MT require that human assessment be approximated at sentence level as well. Researchers report the BLEU score at document level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams in BLEU scoring. But, ultimately, document-level MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the granularity of the sentence. Unfortunately, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005, 2006). While acknowledging the appealing simplicity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an MT candidate translation\u2019s quality, we observe the following facts of n-gram based MT metrics. First, they may not reflect the mechanism of how human beings evaluate sentence translation quality. More specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee the optimization of sentence quality approved by human assessors. Therefore, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessment at sentence level for most candidate translations. Second, it is conceivable that human beings are more reliable ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than assigning a numeric value to index the quality of the candidate translation even with significant deliberation. Consequently, a more intuitive approach for automatic MT evaluation is to replicate the quality ranking ability of human assessors. Thirdly, the BLEU score is elusive and hard to interpret; for example, what can be concluded for a candidate translation\u2019s quality if the BLEU score is 0.0168, particularly when we are aware that even a human translation can receive an embarrassingly low BLEU score? In light of the discussion above, we propose an alternative scenario for MT evaluation, where, instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation under evaluation, we predict its rank with regard to its peer candidate translations. This formulation of the MT evaluation task fills the gap between an automatic scoring function and human MT evaluation practice. The results from the current study will not only interest MT system evaluation moderators but will also inform the research community about which features are useful in improving the correlation between human rankings and automatic rankings.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'BLEU'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "BLEU", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 2th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 2]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "keyword_presence_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"BLEU\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2], \"unchange\")"]}}}

I have been contacted by some fraternities on campus and been to a few parties.  These interactions have made my time here more fun and I feel like I can do things on my own.  I still talk to my family every day and let them know about my classes and night time activities and they have been very supportive.  I thought it would be weird being out on my own, but I have found it to be refreshing and fun to do things on my own or with other kids my own age.  Being 18 is cool because I can finally be considered an adult and i like to be independent and old enough to be accountable.  I miss my family and having the support there to have things like laundry and money and food at my disposal, but I am feeling better about myself when I do things on my own.  It did take a full 2 weeks for me to get settled in my new college dorm life environment and I am glad I met some cool people and have great roommates.  I have another friend here who is in a quad and she doesn't talk to any of them at all.  So weird to be in a room with 3 other people and never hang out or do anything with them.  Seems too strange and uncomfortable to be in a quad like that and not socialize with them.  This is significant because I remember going to college right out of high school and I felt that I wasn't ready.  i tried to convince my parent to take a gap year but they weren't having it or would not even consider letting me do that.  My daughter just went to college 2 weeks ago and she has adjusted well.  I can tell she misses home but she is only 2 hours away and we have seen her once already since she left.  I love that she is taking this better than I did and she actually seems bored because she is so organized.  I feel she deserves a bigger challenge than she is seeing now but I am sure as she progresses at school she can take on more than she has curently.

The revised version should contain more than 19 sentences. Ensure that the word '2' remains unchanged. Additionally, each sentence should contain fewer than 73 tokens:\n\nThe phrase-based approach has been considered the default strategy to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) in recent years. It is widely known that the phrase-based approach is powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within short distance. However, long-distance reordering is problematic in phrase-based SMT. For example, the distance-based reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) allows a decoder to translate in non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as distortion limit. In theory the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value so that all possible reorderings are allowed, yet in practise, it is observed that too high a distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance (Koehn et al., 2005). In our own experiment setting, the best distortion limit for Chinese English translation is 4. However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings longer than such distortion limit. Consider the sentence pair in the NIST MT2005 test set shown in figure 1(a): after translating the word \u201c\u4fee\u8865/mend\u201d, the decoder should \u201cjump\u201d across six words and translate the last phrase \u201c\u5173\u7cfb \u88c2\u7f1d/fissures in the relationship\u201d. Therefore, while short-distance reordering is under the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question. \n\nA terminological remark: In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering respectively. The distinction between long and short distance reordering is solely defined by the distortion limit. \n\nSyntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering. For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side. However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks. It should be noted that the second Chinese block \u201c\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u201d and its English counterpart \u201cat the end of\u201d are not constituents at all. \n\nIn this paper, our interest is the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering and it achieves better MT performance on the basis of the standard phrase-based model. To prove it, we developed a hybrid approach which preserves the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering as well as the strength of syntax in global reordering. \n\nOur method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches like (Xia and McCord, 2004), (Collins et al., 2005), and (Costa-jussa and Fonollos\u00e0, 2006), which split translation into two stages: [MATH] where a sentence of the source language (SL), S, is first reordered with respect to the word order of the target language (TL), and then the reordered SL sentence S' is translated as a TL sentence, T, by monotonous translation. \n\nOur first contribution is a new translation model as represented by formula 2: [MATH] where an n-best list of S', instead of only one S', is generated. The reason of such change will be given in section 2. Note also that the translation process S' \u2192 T is not monotonous, since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering. Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation: [MATH] where Fi are the features in the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S \u2192 S\u2019) is our new feature, viz. the probability of reordering S as S'.

Keep the word 'soil' unchanged:\n\nCompared to other plants in your garden, avocado plants may require lots of water. However, it's important to remember that over-watering is a potential problem for nearly all plants, including avocados. Try to avoid watering so frequently or thoroughly that the avocado tree's soil looks liquid or muddy. Use a soil with good drainage (one rich in organic matter is usually a good bet). If your tree is in a pot, be sure that the pot contains drainage holes in the bottom to allow the water to escape. Follow these simple tips, and your plant should be free from the danger of over-watering. If your plant's leaves begin to turn yellow and you have been watering frequently, this may be a sign of over-watering. Immediately stop watering and begin again only once the soil is dry. You may not need fertilizer at all to grow a strong, healthy avocado tree. However, if they're used sensibly, fertilizers can noticeably boost a young plant's growth. Once the tree is well established, add balanced citrus fertilizer to the soil during the growing season according to the directions included with the fertilizer. Do not overdo it \u2014 when it comes to commercial fertilizer, it is usually best to be somewhat conservative. Always water after fertilizing to ensure the fertilizer is absorbed into the soil and delivered directly to the plant's roots. Like many plants, avocados generally should not be fertilized when they are very young, as they can be very susceptible to the \"burn\" that can result from overusing fertilizer. Try waiting at least a year before fertilizing. Compared to other plants, avocados can be especially vulnerable to the buildup of salt in the soil. Avocado plants suffering from high salt levels may have slightly wilted leaves with \"burnt\", brown tips where excess salt is accumulating. To lower the salinity (saltiness) of your soil, change your watering practices. At least once a month, try to water heavily, soaking the soil. The heavy water flow carries built-up salts deep into the soil, below the roots where they'll be less harmful to the plant. Potted plants are especially susceptible to salt buildup. Once a month, place the pot in a sink or outside, then let water flow completely through the pot and drain out the bottom. Like any agricultural crop, avocado plants can suffer from a variety of pests and diseases that may threaten the quality of the plant's fruit or even endanger the entire plant. Knowing how to recognize and solve these issues is crucial to maintaining a healthy, productive avocado tree. Below are just a few of the most common avocado pests and illnesses \u2014 for more information, consult a botanical resource:  Cankers \u2014 \"Rusty\", sunken sores on the plant that may ooze gum. Cut cankers from affected branches. Cankers on the trunk of the tree may kill the plant. Root rot \u2014 Usually caused by over-watering. Causes yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual decay even when all other conditions for growth are being met. Immediately stop over-watering and, if severe, dig up the roots to expose them to air. Sometimes fatal to plant. Wilts and Blights \u2014 \"Dead\" patches on the tree. Fruits and leaves within these patches wither and die. Remove the affected areas from the tree immediately and wash the tools you use to do so before using them again. Lace bugs \u2014 Cause yellow spots on leaves that quickly dry out. Damaged leaves my die and drop from the branch. Use a commercial pesticide or a natural insect-killing substance like pyrethrin. Borers \u2014 Bore into tree, creating small holes that may ooze sap. Preventative cure is best \u2014 keeping trees healthy and well-nourished makes it harder for trees to be affected. If borers are present, remove and discard any affected branches to decrease their spread.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 2th, and 13th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [2, 13]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'soil'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "soil", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 12], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"soil\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 13], \"unchange\")"]}}}

For example, question answering [Devlin et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2020b, Raffel et al., 2020]), machine translation [Raffel et al., 2020, Brown et al., 2020b], text classification [Raffel et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], and text generation [Yang et al., 2019, Achiam et al., 2023]. However, their performance on complex graph reasoning tasks has been notably inadequate [Zhang, 2023]. Current research highlights that while LLMs can handle basic graph-related queries, they have a challenge with more complex graph structures and multi-step reasoning processes [Liu and Wu, 2023, Wang et al., 2024, Creswell et al., 2022]. \u2217These  Preprint. Under review.             \fFigure 1: Overview of the Evaluation Framework. For each problem, we input problem statement, data examples, and code framework to LLMs. And then they complete the code and give explanations. Finally, the framework evaluates the code on GraphEval2000 and returns the result details. Recognizing the potential of leveraging LLMs\u2019 programming capabilities in computational contexts [Yang et al., 2024, Murphy et al., 2024], we propose to use their programming abilities to enhance reasoning on graphs. To this end, we introduce GraphEval2000, the first dataset designed to evaluate the graph reasoning capability of LLMs through coding challenges. It includes 40 data structure problems and 2,000 test cases. Each problem includes: (1) problem statement, (2) data examples, (3) constraints, and (4) code framework. The dataset has four main graph categories: Sparse, Planar, Regular, and Complete graphs. Within each main category, there are four sub-categories: connected, disconnected, cyclic, and acyclic graphs. Based on GraphEval2000, we propose the evaluation framework, which provides real-time feedback to users. The entire framework is illustrated in Figure 1. Unlike traditional coding challenges (e.g., LeetCode) that obscure test case details [Hou and Ji, 2024, Hu et al., 2024], the framework will return failed test cases along with excution results. To better help readers use our framework to evaluate and improve the performance of LLMs, we propose an instruction-based method, Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD). SSD is designed to enhance LLMs\u2019 ability to understand and solve complex graph problems. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive strategies [Paas and van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2020], SSD decomposes complex tasks into a \u201ccognitive step\u201d and an \u201caction step\u201d, thereby improving model comprehensions. Experiments demonstrate that SSD significantly boosts the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o in hardlevel graph problems, yielding improvements of 11.11%, 33.37%, and 33.37%, respectively. We hope this example inspires the community to further utilize our framework to explore LLMs\u2019 reasoning abilities on graphs. Our contributions are summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose GraphEval2000, the first graph dataset specifically designed to evaluate the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs through code. This dataset includes 40 data structure problems and 2000 graph test cases. It is organized into four primary graph categories, each containing four sub-categories, ensuring a diverse representation of graph structures; \u2022 Based on GraphEval2000, we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs. This framework not only tests the models but also provides real-time feedback, enabling users to iteratively improve their models\u2019 performance; \u2022 We have established the first benchmark for LLMs on graph data structure problems, involving eight of the most popular LLMs. Our experiment reveals that LLMs understand directed graph structures better than undirected ones. While open-source models generally underperform relative to private LLMs, the performance gap is narrow, and in certain graph categories, they demonstrate comparable performance. \u2022 To enhance the usability of our evaluation framework and GraphEval2000, we proposed Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD), an instruction-based method. SSD decomposes complicated problems into distinct reasoning components, facilitating better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSD, resulting in an average 25% improvement in performance for GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o. \u2022 GraphEval2000 is released under MIT license.

Send the manager a brief and polite email asking them to explain the test to you. For example, you can say: \u201cI am writing to ask some follow-up questions about the assessment test. Specifically, how will the test be administered and what will it cover? Thank you for your help.\u201d In a skills-based assessment, these are the most common abilities that you'll be tested on. Check with the hiring manager first, though, to find out if you will be tested on any of these. Employment agencies sometimes offer practice skills tests on their website. For skills like math, you can look for books of sample quizzes at your local library or bookstore. Use your scores on these tests to figure out what skills you need to work on before taking the test. Practice solving sample math problems for at least an hour a day leading up to the test. If you need to improve your skills more quickly, increase the amount of time you're studying. If you have a friend who's particularly good at math, ask them to help you study. When you get sample problems wrong, make sure you look over your work to figure out why. Focus on studying math skills relevant to the job position. For instance, if you're applying to work as an architect you might be tested on your ability to calculate dimensions. Practice your grammar, spelling, and typing skills as needed. Work on these for at least an hour a day leading up to the test, or more if necessary. Show your work to someone with a good understanding of writing and ask them how you can improve and what skills you need to work on. If the job ad asks for proficiency in specific software programs, you may need to demonstrate proficiency on your test. For instance, if the job requires you to know how to use Excel, you may be given sample tasks to perform using that program.  If you need to sharpen your software skills before the test, set yourself sample tasks to perform so you feel confident using the program on the test. Search for online tutorials if you need to refresh your memory of the software program. If you're taking the test at home, work away from distractions, like the TV. You want to be focused on the assessment. If you're taking the test at the office, bring a bottle of water or anything else you might need to feel comfortable. Take a few deep breaths if you find yourself getting stressed out. If you can't think of the answer to a question, try to come back to it after you've finished the rest of the test. Try not to worry about whether or not you'll ultimately get the job, and instead focus on answering each question as well as you can. Don't simply glance at questions and assume you understand them completely. If a question confuses you, read it again. If you read a question several times and still don't understand it, take your best guess and try to come back to it later if there's time.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'at least an hour'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "at least an hour", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"hour\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"at least an hour\", 1, \"equal\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at least an hour\", \"remove\")"]}}}

Traditionally, studies in sentiment analysis had been mostly focused on high-resource languages such as English due to a deficit of annotated data in other low-resource languages, but recent research has emerged to address this issue by leveraging machine translation to augment data resources (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020) (Joshi et al., 2020). gpt-3-5-turbo Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) and BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022). Such multilingual pre-trained language models exploit the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from a mixture of many languages, facilitating zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from a source to a target language on different downstream NLP tasks, albeit with varying performance outcomes (Lauscher et al., 2020). More recently, Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and Llama-3  2024) have collected immense attention for their unparalleled performance in text generation. (Zhang et al., 2023) shows the strong capability of LLMs with few-shot in-context learning in public English sentiment analysis tasks. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in both public and proprietary LLMs (Qin et al., 2024) (Zhu et al., 2023). Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, the capability of cross-lingual transfer in these LLMs has not been fully studied for sentiment analysis tasks, and it is still unclear how LLMs stand in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models in the cross-lingual transfer paradigm. In this work, we examine a variety of pre-trained models and conduct a comprehensive study on the cross-lingual transfer capability in utterancelevel sentiment analysis tasks with human speech transcript. We classify our candidate public pretrained models into two categories: Small Multilin22 n u J 2 ] L C . s c [ v59.02 : v i X r a             \fgual Language Models (SMLM)2 such as XLM-R and mT5, and more recent Large Language Models (LLM)3 primarily focused on English such as Llama-3  2024) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023). In addition, we also include benchmarking with proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), which is widely considered as the best LLM in terms of general capability. To avoid potential data contamination introduced in the pre-training process of recent LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023), we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets from in-house human conversation transcripts, and assess cross-lingual sentiment analysis from English to three target languages: Spanish, French and Chinese. Our evaluation results show that with the same supervised fine-tuning, SMLMs demonstrate superior zeroshot cross-lingual transfer capability even with much fewer model parameters. However, public LLMs exhibit rapid improvement in few-shot crosslingual transfer scenarios and can surpass the performance of SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are provided.

He was hit by a drunk driver whose four wheel drive pickup smashed into the driver's side of my brother's small, Toyota Yaris, killing my brother instantly. My brother was only 20 years old, still studying at college and had only begun to live his life. My youngest brother was the baby of the family being the youngest of 5. He was the only brother so was especially cherished by his 4 older sisters. He was studious, giving, caring and tried to do the right thing at all times. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He took time to keep in touch with out parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family and none of us are quite sure how to deal with the hurt. We are close, all live in the same town and have each other but that doesn't seem to assuage any of the hurt or loss in our hearts. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents but as we are suffering as well it has been a botched job at best. My sisters and I can help each other though, lending a sympathetic ear at least. We are still muddling through this and I don't know that my family will ever completely get over the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved to hike, canoe and camp. Because of this my sisters and I are thinking of creating a sort of memorial along one of his favorite hiking trails in our town. The trail has a program where you can plant a tree and/or pay for a bench along the trail which helps fund the trail. I want to do both, plant a tree which will shade the bench as it grows, with a plaque showing it was donated in my brother's name. I think this would be a wonderful way to memorialize my little brother as he loved being outside hiking while always having his old Pentax film camera along with him. As I write this I find I have made the decision, I will do this for sure, plant a tree for my brother and provide a place for weary hikers to sit in memorial to him.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 23th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [23]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 0.7272727272727273, "simpo_full_length": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.8, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"four wheel drive\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"brother\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"four wheel drive pickup\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"brother\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"little brother\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"his\", 10, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"]}}}

While many insist on defining career success based on measurable qualities, such as salary and ranking, there are many ways to define success in your career based on your goals.  Part of what makes it difficult to precisely define career success is that there are so many factors at play. Your relationship with your co-workers, your reputation in your field, your salary, your benefits, and more all play a role in whether you can consider yourself successful. A lot of people feel overwhelmed by the many factors that influence their sense of success.  To avoid feeling stressed about whether your successful in traditional terms, try to view your career success in a personal manner. Do you feel fulfilled by your job? Are you happy going into work in the mornings? Much of success is unfortunately beyond your control. You need to accept there are various definitions of success and what ultimately matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment. If you're looking to define success, first define your priorities and passions. Whether or not your career helps you fulfill your passions is a major determining factor in whether or not you feel successful.  Think about when you were younger. What did you want to be when you grew up as a child? What were your goals in college? Are you using your degree? Why or why not? Oftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose track of their true passions and interests. Conversely, people who feel stressed over their career feel successful when they realize their work truly reflects their passion.  Do not fear change. Sometimes, defining one's passions can help with a personal definition of success. Acknowledging what you're doing in the present moment is not, by your standards, successful is scary. It can also be an opportunity to grow. If you always wanted to be a teacher, for example, and work in marketing consider returning to school for a teaching degree. In some states, community colleges may allow you to teach with just an undergraduate education. What is really important to you? Do you crave prestige and honor? Does climbing the corporate ladder, making connections, and closing deals sound like an ideal career? Or are you more idealistically oriented? Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you? There is no wrong way to crave success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you as an individual can help you define success. It's vital that you avoid outside definitions of success. Research shows the happiest, most fulfilled people across all careers are those who define success based on personal goals, passions, and desires.  Try to write down your definition of success and put in a place where you can see it each day. Reminding yourself of your goals can help you on your way to success.  Your definition of success should be somewhat vague. As so much of success is beyond your personal control, keep your definition all encompassing. Something like, \"I want to feel fulfilled in my work every day and do a job that's intellectually stimulating for me.\" Many people view success as a series of goals. You get your degree, then a job, then a promotion, and so on. Oftentimes, people find their measurable success to be somewhat hollow and disappointing. Once you've reached a goal, you may feel disappointed that you're not as happy or fulfilled as you thought. Instead, view your life as a continuous journey where you try to do a bit better each day. This will keep you stimulated and emotionally and intellectually active longterm.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'what'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "what", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 39 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 39}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_full_length": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword(word=\"what\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"what\", 2, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"what\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(39, \"more than\")"]}}}

Furthermore, research on multilingualism has contributed to the development of more effective machine learning models, such as neural translation systems (Zou et al., 2013). With the rise of large language models \u2217\u2217Equal contribution. Figure 1: The three types of bilingualism. (LLMs), researchers have discovered many emergent properties (Wei et al., 2022a) in these models, and have used them for a variety of purposes (Wei et al., 2022b). However, the multilingual ability of these models has not been extensively studied. Previous research has shown that large language models, such as GPT, are capable of performing a wide variety of language tasks when the task is presented in English (Qin et al., 2023). However, investigations into the multilingual language abilities of these models have been limited. Shi et al. (2023) explore this topic by applying the models to multilingual datasets, and measuring performance differences across languages. However, they do not explore the underlying mechanisms of how LLMs perform different tasks, nor how this affects the results. Moreover, most LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023) are trained on datasets that are heavily skewed towards English, which leaves open the question of how multilingual abilities in such models are acquired. In this study, we present a systematic approach to analyzing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we propose categorizing language-dependent abilities into three distinct categories which vary in the impact of language choice on the performance: Reasoning (least impact), Knowledge Access, and Articulation (most impact). We investigate a carefully selected set of tasks from these three categories by evaluknife(a) Compound(b) Coordinate(c) SubordinatecouteauLexiconInternalConceptEnFrknifecouteauEnFrTranslationTypeknifecouteauEnFr            \fating the multilingual abilities of an LLM using a novel prompting method which we call response back-translation (RBT). By comparing the generated answers, we can both measure multilingual performance of the LLM, but also determine the type of multilinguality they exhibit. For example, we examine the capabilities of LLMs on pun detection, a highly language-dependent task. The results of our experiments show that the popular LLM \u201cGPT\u201d: (1) achieves higher performance when the task is presented in English; (2) achieves higher performance on tasks that can be translated without altering the correct output; and (3) exhibits a mixture of coordinate and subordinate bilingualism.

One of the most attractive pretraining paradigms is auto-regressive language model such as GPT2 [29] and XLNet [37]. With billions or even trillions of parameters, and abundant unlabeled training data, PLMs can generate diverse and realistic sentences. Formally, autoregressive PLM models the probability distribution of text X = {x1, x2, ..., xT } with the chain rule: T (cid:89) p(X) = p(xi|x1, x2, ..., xi\u22121). (1) i=1 However, those models are usually trained on general purpose corpus and the sentences generated by those PLMs are usually inconsistent with task requirements. Therefore, to improve the applicability of PLMs, making the PLMs more controllable has been an important task in natural language generation. Controllable language generation attempts to model p(X|a) where a is a desired attribute (e.g. topic, length and sentiment): p(X|a) = T (cid:89) i=1 p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a). (2) To simplify the expression, we use X1:i to denote the sequence {x1, x2, ..., xi}. Earlier works directly model p(X|a) by maximizing the likelihood of the task-speci\ufb01c corpus. These methods are called Preprint. Under review.             \fClass Conditional Language Models (CCLMs) [39; 12; 15]. Since the training data for speci\ufb01c attributes is limited, CCLMs usually suffer from corpus over\ufb01tting. Bayesian Controllable Language Models (BCLMs) [5; 18; 36] are proposed to solve the corpus over\ufb01tting problem. They attempt to \ufb01nd a generation path of the pre-trained language model that matches the target attribute. BCLMs use a discriminator to model the class probability p(a|X1:i) and then sample the desired output from p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) according to the Bayes Rule: p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) \u221d p(a|X1:i)p(xi|X1:i\u22121). (3) With the Bayes Rule, BCLMs have converted the controllable language generation task to the combination of a unconditional language generation task and a classi\ufb01cation task. Since the p(xi|X1:i\u22121) can be given by an off-the-shelf PLM (in this paper we always use the GPT2 model), BCLMs only need to model p(a|X1:i). BCLMs usually train the discriminator with the sentences from the task-speci\ufb01c corpus to model p(a|X1:i). However, in inference, the discriminator receives the text generated by GPT2 as input which is different from the training corpus. The mismatch between training and inference limits the performance of BCLMs. In this work, we propose to use GPT2 to extract the features of the sentences from the task-speci\ufb01c corpus and use the features as the input to the discriminator. Since GPT2 has been pre-trained on general purpose corpus, it is reasonable to assume that it has \u201cseen\u201d similar sentences from the task-speci\ufb01c corpus. It is roughly equivalent to saying that the discriminator has been pre-trained on the large-scale general-purpose corpus. This mitigates the mismatch problem in BCLMs. However, doing this job is challenging. In Equation (3), xi is to be generated at step i in inference. To get the probability distribution of xi, we need to calculate p(a|X1:i\u22121, w) for all token w in the vocabulary. It is a huge cost for extracting the features of sentence {X1:i\u22121, w} for all token w in the vocabulary. To address the ef\ufb01ciency problem, we introduce \u201cGemini Discriminator\u201d (Gemini) for controllable language generation. The Gemini uses the features extracted by GPT2 as input in training, and has small computational cost in inference. To improve the performance of Gemini, we adopt knowledge distillation [9; 17] in training. Moreover, inspired by the nucleus sampling [11] and the decoding strategy in GeDi [18], we design an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method in generation, which considers both the \ufb02uency and the attribute relevance in generation. We experimented on two controllable language generation tasks: sentiment control and topic control. On both tasks, Gemini reached new state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 17th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [17]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 39 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 39}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'controllable'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "controllable", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666665, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.75, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"controllable\", 1, \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"controllable\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Although LLMs are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, some studies demonstrate their additional abilities. For instance, they are employed to generate executable code and even achieve remarkable performance in Google coding interviews [6]. Beyond text understanding capability, we find that LLMs are capable of processing text layouts that are denoted by spatial markers. As shown in Figure 1, we conceptualize the newline-separated plain text as a \"visual\" two-dimensional canvas, as text editors and browsers are visually two-dimensional intuitively. Three identical questions with distinct answers are arranged in different orientations, interspersed with space markers (denoted as layout). We inquire with ChatGPT about the answers to various orientations. Remarkably, ChatGPT provides accurate responses, and some other open-source LLMs also demonstrate reasonable results. To compare with this, we exclude the space markers from the original data (denoted as strip), resulting in a substantial decline in performance. More examples can be found in Appendix A. This study initiates a comprehensive examination of LLMs\u2019 proficiency in understanding text layout, aiming to unravel insights into their performance and implications across various datasets and finetuning methodologies. (a) Layout Here are three names mentioned in the context: What is your name? I\u2019m James. What is your name? I\u2019 m Oliver. What is your name? I\u2019m Emma.

Question: What is the name mentioned in the top-left corner? Answer: The name mentioned in the top-left corner is not specified in the given context. Figure 1: Illustration of ChatGPT comprehending text layout. First, we build up a dataset called TextLayoutQA to evaluate LLMs\u2019 text layout understanding capability. Through experiments with the GPT-3.5/4, Baichuan2 [45], Llama2 [39] and ChatGLM3 [48] models, we uncover that the incorporation of text layout information substantially enhances model performance, resulting in an 8\u223c33% gain compared to text without layout. Furthermore, we explore the effects of pre-training and instruction-tuning stages on LLMs\u2019 comprehension of text layout. We illustrate that although LLMs initially demonstrate a basic understanding during pre-training, their proficiency is further enhanced during the instruction-tuning stage. Moreover, we explore the essential role of training data in shaping LLMs\u2019 understanding of text layout, emphasizing the necessity of datasets enriched with layout information, such as code and table data. Through instruction-tuning, we reveal the varying impacts of different types of datasets on LLMs\u2019 performance, providing detailed insights into their contributions and constraints. Our findings not only illuminate the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs in comprehending text layout, but also carry profound implications for their broader applications. By unraveling the intricacies of LLMs\u2019 interaction with text layout information, we pave the way for leveraging this capability in tasks ranging from visual question answering (VQA) [26] to document analysis and beyond.

Once on the website, look for a link that will allow you to file a police report online. Not all police stations will allow you to file a police report online. In that case, you will need to do so in person. From the initial reporting page, the police department typically provides information about the types of incidents you can report online. Make sure your incident fits into one of these categories.  You shouldn't file an online report for a violent incident or a crime in progress. Call 911 if people's lives are in danger, or call the police non-emergency number. Incidents involving lost or stolen property, damaged property, or vandalism typically can be reported online. You also can file an online report for financial crimes, including theft or identity theft. Some police departments only allow you a limited amount of time to enter your information before the form resets. Organize anything you'll need before you start to avoid having to start over.  You may want to write down notes with specific facts and details related to the incident, so you don't have to type in your information off the top of your head. For example, you might write a list of names of others who were involved or who witnessed the incident. You also might make note of the date and time the incident occurred and the street address of the specific location. If you have any documents or other files related to the incident, you may be able to upload them along with your report. In most cases you can't file an anonymous report online. You typically want to provide contact information even if you can. This will allow you to follow up on the report, and police can contact you if they have any questions or information for you. Provide an email address and phone number so police can contact you if they have any questions or need additional information to process your report. Some online report forms may ask for specific details separately, such as the location of the incident and type of incident you're reporting. Then you'll have a field to describe the incident.  Stick to the facts, including as many specific details as you can remember. Don't include any description of your feelings, emotional reactions, or speculative thoughts. The field you have to enter details may be limited to a certain number of characters. Include as many details as possible, but be brief. Make every word count. When you click submit to send your report, you typically are given the opportunity to print a page that contains the information you submitted. If you're given the opportunity to preview your report before you submit it, look it over for typos or errors. If you're not able to print a copy of your report, write down any confirmation number or report number that you're provided. You may need these to follow up on the report later, or to share with an insurance company. When you file a police report online, you typically will hear from the police department within a day or two. They'll let you know if an officer has been assigned to investigate, and any further action you need to take.  If you don't hear from the police department, call the non-emergency number. Let the dispatcher know that you want to follow up on a police report you filed online. Find out the name of the investigating officer, if any, in case you gain new information about the incident and need to update your report.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'report'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "report", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571, "gpt4o": 0.75, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"report\", 1, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"report\", \"keep\")"]}}}

When you feel that your work has value, it will be easier to invest more time and energy into it.  Mission statements also serve as helpful guides when you develop new ideas. Coming up with an innovative idea can be intimidating when you're staring at a blank sheet of paper. A mission statement puts something on that paper for you to work from, which can make the brainstorming process easier. When it's time to brainstorm a new idea, turn to your mission statement and ask yourself if there are facets that have not yet been adequately addressed. Start working from whichever aspect of your mission is currently weakest. Ask questions about everything, even the things you already think you know. You may discover a new way to approach something you previously believed to be set in stone.  Try looking at something you do each day. Ask yourself who else does it and how they might do it differently. There are many ways to approach most tasks, and if you assume that yours is the best, you're taking a fairly big risk. When analyzing different methods, ask yourself why the person who started the method chose to pursue it. Consider whether other alternatives were considered and rejected. Also ask yourself if other assumptions or constraints limited that source's actions. Concerning both familiar and unfamiliar methods, ask yourself what your complaints are about those methods and what your friends' or colleagues' complaints might also be. \u201cBook learning\u201d is great, but it will only take you so far. Only by getting out into the field and gaining firsthand knowledge of the way things really work can you hope to understand how to streamline and improve on things within that field.  Keep in mind that the knowledge available in books was first discovered by people who didn't have such books to work with. They were people who experienced matters for themselves, and their experiences brought about information that would last beyond their own lifetimes. No two people see the world in exactly the same way. By viewing or experiencing something for yourself, you bring your own unique set of questions and beliefs to the table. As such, you might be able to make observations no one else has made yet. Some unique observations may lead nowhere, but others can lead you toward new innovations within the field. It pays to get inside your customers' heads. Standard customer service will only benefit you so much, though. You'll need to care about your customers as much as you care about their patronage if you want to think up new ways to address their needs and wants.  Get to know your customers as thoroughly as your resources will allow. Try not to rely on secondhand accounts provided by consultants or research. Instead, connect with your customers directly. When you start from scratch, your official market doesn't exist yet. You'll need to spend time getting to know prospective customers in your target market, as well as prospective partners and suppliers. Gain inspiration from as many sources as possible. New ideas won't necessarily strike during the time you've allotted for inspiration. They often come when you least expect them to do so, and may even come from sources you'd never expect.  If you're working with others in a shared space, try posting an idea board in an area everyone passes by. The people in your team can post problems and ideas to the board. Other teammates should respond to those issues as they see fit. This continual exchange of knowledge can lead to new and exciting ideas. Listen to others and hear what they have to say about some of the issues you're working on. You don't need to directly ask them for help with your project, but by observing the complaints and concerns they express, you might gain a better perspective on how to approach the matter.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 41th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [41]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 14 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 14}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.25, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"41st\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"keep\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"keep\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([41], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Avoid using the word 'syllabus', and do not alter the 25th and 26th sentences:\n\nEach professor should provide you with a syllabus on the first day of class. The syllabus will list all the materials you need for each class in addition to a schedule of assignments with due dates. Carefully read over each syllabus as soon as you get it. Highlight the materials you need as well as other pertinent information, such as attendance and late work policies. Ask your professor if anything seems unclear. It\u2019s also a good idea to reread each syllabus several times throughout the semester to remind yourself of important information. It\u2019s important that you purchase all the required reading for your classes. Once you get a copy of the syllabus for each class, bring them to the school bookstore, and check off each subject you buy the books for one by one. When you are finished, double check to ensure you haven\u2019t missed any.  Your teacher will not provide any materials they\u2019ve asked you to secure. It\u2019s also unlikely you can \u201cborrow\u201d a book from the teacher, as you might have been able to in high school. Consulting your syllabi, organize your schoolbooks at home in the chronological order you will need them. You\u2019ll be ready to read your way through the year and won\u2019t struggle to find a title when you need it. While at the bookstore, purchase a calendar that extends many months out, so you can keep track of dorm events, exams, papers and thesis presentations. Choose a planner that\u2019s easy to carry with you and has plenty of space to create notes.  While digital planners are available, a paper planner enables you to see tasks for many months at a time at a glance. Many digital planners show a marker to indicate you have something a given day, but require you to click further to see relevant details. A paper planner, however analog, shows you all events and relevant notes easily. Put important syllabi dates in your calendar before you start classes. You can hit the ground running and see what will be due right away, while everyone else is still getting oriented.This will also help you prepare for times when projects or tests for different classes are scheduled during the same few days or weeks. Look over your syllabi and take stock of the basic school supplies you will need to complete the assignments listed, such as binders, pens, dividers, and notepaper. Make a list, checking off any you already own. Purchase any you don\u2019t have from an office supply store, such as OfficeMax or Staples.  Color coding can help keep your materials for different subjects better organized. Simply assign a color to each subject and purchase a binder, notebook, etc. for that class in that color. It will make keeping track of your notes and materials easier if you always know where to look. Get a sheet of stickers in each color as well.

The task of headline generation involves automatically generating informative and captivating headlines that accurately capture the essence of the underlying text. Headline generation is challenging due to two major factors: firstly, headlines must accurately represent the content of the text while being concise. This requires a fine balance between capturing the key information and maintaining brevity. Secondly, headlines often need to \u2217*  be attention-grabbing, compelling readers to click and read further. This necessitates the use of persuasive language, creativity, and an understanding of rhetorical devices. In recent years, the NLP community has achieved remarkable strides in the development of headline-generation models. However, the focus has primarily been on English and other widely spoken languages, inadvertently leaving a significant void in the realm of headline generation for Indian languages. While datasets like Gigaword (Graff et al., 2003; Napoles et al., 2012) have emerged as prominent resources, comprising an impressive collection of over 4 million news article-headline pairs, it is crucial to acknowledge that they are limited to English and fail to capture the intricacies and linguistic nuances of Indian languages. India, with its rich linguistic diversity, boasts a staggering array of over 22 officially recognized languages, each with its own distinct grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Addressing the challenge of headline generation in Indian languages necessitates a deep understanding of the specific linguistic and cultural intricacies inherent in each language. One of the most significant obstacles hindering headline generation in Indian languages is the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. This scarcity severely limits the effectiveness of model training and impedes the performance of supervised learning approaches, which heavily rely on labeled examples. Fortunately, recent advancements in neural network architectures, such as transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced the performance of headline generation models. These models possess the ability to encode input text and generate headlines by optimizing various objectives, including semantic coherence, informativeness, and readability. While these models have successfully reduced the dependency on labeled data, they still leverage fine-tuning on specialized headline generation             \fdatasets to further enhance their performance. In the context of Bengali language, Salehin et al. (2019); Amin et al. (2021) conducted data collection1 from various news websites using web scraping techniques. They proposed an RNN-based encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism for headline generation. Another notable resource for multilingual abstractive summarization, XL-Sum, was introduced by Hasan et al. (2021). The Indian language section of the XLSum dataset consists of 251K article-headline pairs sourced from BBC2. To further advance research in Natural Language Generation (NLG) for Indian languages, Kumar et al. (2022) proposed the IndicNLG benchmark, encompassing five different NLG tasks, including a headline generation dataset (hereafter referred to as IndicHG dataset). This dataset comprises 1.31 million article-headline pairs across 11 Indian languages. However, our analysis (detailed in Section 4) reveals serious quality issues, such as data contamination, rendering it unsuitable for training robust models. Despite its claimed size, the dataset\u2019s problematic samples significantly reduce its effective size by nearly half. To summarize our main contributions: 1. We present a large, multilingual headlinegeneration dataset \"Mukhyansh\", comprising over 3.39 million news article-headline pairs across 8 Indian languages; namely Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs), autonomous vehicles, and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have emerged from this ongoing trend. Due to the heterogeneous and interactive nature of these systems-of-systems, their engineering has become a highly e\ufb00ortful task that faces many challenges [33, 36, 39, 40, 57]. One of them is certainly the need for collaboration of experts from di\ufb00erent domains [20]. This challenge also manifests in the rising number of requirements that address stakeholders from heterogeneous domains. In systems engineering, and in particular the automotive domain, requirements are captured as documents that contain text mainly in natural language [41] often with additional information provided through, e.g., pictures or Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. Experts interpret these textual requirements to enter the design phase, and most often derive details of the implementation directly from them [22]. The ambiguity of natural language, in particular, when interpreted by experts from di\ufb00erent backgrounds, as well as the increasing number of requirements may result in decreasing product quality, system failures which are currently detected at late development stages [17] and hinders the implementation of functional safety standards such ISO 26262. Furthermore, the document-based approach to requirements engineering prevents agile development, where automated analyses and syntheses should enable early error detection and fast feedback for the developers. What is needed are tools to capture, analyze, and process requirements systematically during all phases of the development cycle. An approach to achieve this is Model\u2013 Driven Engineering (MDE) [22], which utilizes models as the primary development artifacts. That is, these models serve as documentation and communication basis for engineers, but also as input for analyses and syntheses, such as veri\ufb01cation [34], test case [17], or code generation [16]. For instance, MDE can be applied to facilitate the design of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI)-based systems [2, 26, 37, 38]. Approaches to introduce MDE in the automotive requirements engineering exist [42], but introducing MDE comes with initial costs and e\ufb00orts for training the domain experts in modeling, and most often, for translating many documents to models [8]. An advantage of using Domain Speci\ufb01c Languages (DSLs) rather than general purpose modeling languages such as the Uni\ufb01ed Modeling Language (UML) is that their syntax and semantics [29] can be designed to be intuitive for the model users. As requirements are captured in natural language, we assume that a textual DSL that o\ufb00ers sentence structures and wording that is close to the current             \fVincent Bertram, Miriam Bo\u00df, Evgeny Kusmenko, Imke Helene Nachmann, Bernhard Rumpe, Danilo Trotta, Louis Wachtmeister formulation of requirements increases intuitiveness of both usage and understanding of models in this DSL signi\ufb01cantly. However, in addition to the DSL development costs and the DSL training, once the DSL is developed, the translation of old, unstructured requirements to models in the DSL can be a tremendous e\ufb00ort due to the high number of requirements, requiring time and modeling know-how from the translating developer. In this paper, we analyze an open-source set of automotive requirements for ADAS and Adaptive Light System (ALS) to understand where formulation inaccuracies occur and how targeted DSL constructs can help eliminate these inaccuracies and increase the level of formality and consistency in these requirements. The goal and main contribution of this paper is the application and evaluation of fewshot learning of large neural natural language models for the translation of given unstructured requirements to sentences incorporating the new formal DSL constructs. Such translation models can be used 1) during the introduction phase of a DSL to automatically translate existing or legacy natural language requirements into the new DSL syntax and 2) to correct natural language inputs in a smart editor when a requirement engineer writes a new requirement as natural text. With this automation supported by the fact that few-shot learning requires only a handful of translation examples to learn a given translation task, our aim is to facilitate the introduction of highly specialized requirement DSLs, e.g., targeting a single department of a company using speci\ufb01c wording or even a single project. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the technical foundations of our approach; Section 3 highlights the challenges and potentials of an MDE approach for requirements engineering within engineering domains, driven by natural-language text-based documents. Section 4 outlines related work in this area. Section 5 presents an example DSL for capturing requirements in the automotive domain.

Each sentence should have more than ten words. Ensure the total output is under 420 words but over 400 words. The output must also have fewer than 26 sentences:\n\nEach professor should provide you with a syllabus on the first day of class. The syllabus will list all the materials you need for each class in addition to a schedule of assignments with due dates. Carefully read over each syllabus as soon as you get it. Highlight the materials you need as well as other pertinent information, such as attendance and late work policies. Ask your professor if anything seems unclear. It\u2019s also a good idea to reread each syllabus several times throughout the semester to remind yourself of important information. It\u2019s important that you purchase all the required reading for your classes. Once you get a copy of the syllabus for each class, bring them to the school bookstore, and check off each subject you buy the books for one by one. When you are finished, double check to ensure you haven\u2019t missed any.  Your teacher will not provide any materials they\u2019ve asked you to secure. It\u2019s also unlikely you can \u201cborrow\u201d a book from the teacher, as you might have been able to in high school. Consulting your syllabi, organize your schoolbooks at home in the chronological order you will need them. You\u2019ll be ready to read your way through the year and won\u2019t struggle to find a title when you need it. While at the bookstore, purchase a calendar that extends many months out, so you can keep track of dorm events, exams, papers and thesis presentations. Choose a planner that\u2019s easy to carry with you and has plenty of space to create notes.  While digital planners are available, a paper planner enables you to see tasks for many months at a time at a glance. Many digital planners show a marker to indicate you have something a given day, but require you to click further to see relevant details. A paper planner, however analog, shows you all events and relevant notes easily. Put important syllabi dates in your calendar before you start classes. You can hit the ground running and see what will be due right away, while everyone else is still getting oriented.This will also help you prepare for times when projects or tests for different classes are scheduled during the same few days or weeks. Look over your syllabi and take stock of the basic school supplies you will need to complete the assignments listed, such as binders, pens, dividers, and notepaper. Make a list, checking off any you already own. Purchase any you don\u2019t have from an office supply store, such as OfficeMax or Staples.  Color coding can help keep your materials for different subjects better organized. Simply assign a color to each subject and purchase a binder, notebook, etc. for that class in that color. It will make keeping track of your notes and materials easier if you always know where to look. Get a sheet of stickers in each color as well. You can code handouts, too, so you know at a glance what subject they belong to.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.048780487804878044, "simpo": 0.4000000000000001, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check('more than', 'equal')", "keyword_keep_removal_check('less than', 'equal')", "keyword_keep_removal_check('more than', 'less than')", "keyword_frequency_check('sentence', 25, 'less than')", "word_count_check(400, 'less than')", "word_count_check(420, 'more than')", "sentence_count_check(25, 'less than')", "sentence_count_check(26, 'more than')", "sentence_length_check(10, 'more than')", "sentence_length_check(20, 'less than')", "sentence_modification_check(1, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(2, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(3, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(4, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(5, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(6, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(7, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(8, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(9, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(10, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(11, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(12, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(13, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(14, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(15, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(16, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(17, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(18, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(19, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(20, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(21, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(22, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(23, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(24, 'change')", "sentence_modification_check(25, 'change')"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence has more than 11 words:\n\nPre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020b), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), have exhibited remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Notably, their multilingual versions have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual settings (Pires et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019). In these scenarios, \u2217 equal contribution PLMs are fine-tuned on English data, often with limited or even without data from other languages, yet they acquire the proficiency to handle tasks in different languages. However, multilingual PLMs are typically constructed using stacked transformer layers or their variants, employing self-attention mechanisms to capture diverse and distant dependencies among tokens. The use of self-attention introduces significant computational complexity. Consequently, the inference complexity of multilingual PLMs has become a bottleneck, limiting their deployment on devices sensitive to latency and constrained by computational resources. To fulfill the stringent requirements for efficient inference in applications, various methods have been proposed to accelerate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) inference. These methods include model compression (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020, 2019), early exiting (Xin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021), and model cascading (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). Among these, model cascading methods are particularly appealing for several reasons: 1) They do not depend on specific hardware support, such as custom chips and GPUs. 2) They eliminate the need to train an inference-efficient model from scratch on the pre-training corpora. 3) They offer flexibility to adapt to the latest, incrementally powerful PLMs. Model cascading methods involve the aggregation of multiple PLMs with different sizes. Confidence scores are computed sequentially, ranging from small to large size models, to determine the appropriate model to employ. Once a confidence score surpasses a threshold, the corresponding model is selected, and the inference process ends. Cascade-based models, however, exhibit notable limitations in cross-lingual scenarios. The confidence score, which measures the probability of the current prediction being correct in cascade-based models, is determined by the maximum output             \fold determined on English data to be applicable to other languages. Specifically, we introduce a plugin calibration step at the base of mPLMs. Initially, we normalize the logits to alleviate over-confidence during model fine-tuning. Subsequently, we implement a temperature scaling step to adjust the logits with a learnable scalar parameter. The proposed framework calibrates each individual model in the cascade, providing more reliable confidence scores. This, in turn, enhances the model\u2019s performance and generalization capabilities, leading to consistent improvements in efficiency and accuracy across different languages. Importantly, the proposed framework only requires an extra calibration module at the base of mPLMs, preserving the original architectures of mPLMs. Hence, it demonstrates flexibility to accommodate the latest models with minimal additional training overhead. The primary contributions of this paper is C3, a flexible and effective framework for enhancing efficiency in cross-lingual inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dedicated to the design of inference-efficient models specifically tailored for cross-lingual scenarios. Based on the observation of a notable overconfidence phenomenon in both encoder-only PLMs and decoderonly PLMs in cross-lingual scenarios, and considering that the extent of overconfidence appears to be correlated with linguistic distance, we introduce a plug-in calibration module to address this issue. Extensive experiments on five crosslingual benchmarks, including XNLI, PAWS-X, QAM, GSM8k, and TabMWP, where the first three are text classification datasets and the later two are generation datasets, indicate that the proposed C3 outperforms baselines significantly and achieves a good efficiency-accuracy trade-off, e.g., preserving 98.10% of BERT\u2019s performance and 95.28% of Llama-2\u2019s performance on classification task and an average of 74.3% performance on generation task only half the computation costs.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 9th, and 16th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [9, 16]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 11 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 11}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.75, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"9th\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"16th\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}}}

Despite their effectiveness, LLMs, often characterized as \u201cblack-box\u201d systems, present a substantial challenge in terms of explainability and transparency. This opacity can lead to unintended consequences, such as the generation of harmful or misleading content (Gehman et al., 2020), and the occurrence of model hallucinations (Weidinger et al., 2021). These issues underscore the urgency for improved explainability, not just for understanding, but for responsible and ethical application. Explainability in LLMs serves two critical functions. For end users, it fosters trust by clarifying the model\u2019s reasoning in a nontechnical manner, enhancing understanding of their capabilities and potential flaws (Zhao et al., 2023). For developers and researchers, it offers insights into unintended biases and areas of improvement, serving as a tool for improving the performance of the model in downstream tasks (Bastings et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b). However, the scale of LLMs poses unique challenges to explainability. Larger models with more parameters and extensive training data are harder to interpret. Traditional explanation methods such as SHAP values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) become less practical for these large-scale models (Zhao et al., 2023). Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of LLMspecific phenomena, including in-context learning (Halawi et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), along with addressing issues such as model hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023) and inherent biases (dev, 2023; An and Rudinger, 2023; Schick et al., 2021), is vital for ongoing refinement in model design. In this survey, we focus on explainability methods for pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs, often termed as base models. These models often scale up in training data and have billions of parameters; examples include GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-J (Chen et al., 2021), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), OPT (Yordanov et al., 2022), and LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). In Section 2, we categorize and pose research questions based on our survey. Based on this categorization, we review explainability methods in Section 3, followed by a discussion in Section 4 on how these insights are leveraged. We further discuss the evaluation methods and metrics in Section 5.

Cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. Place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker.  Leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces. Use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass. If you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to cut straight. Begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward.  Make sure that you're applying the right amount of pressure. You should hear a nice, clear \"zzzzip\" as you score. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line. Too much pressure and you'll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. Make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size and the curve of the glass. The goal, of course, is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.  For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands.  For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if you need to. As long as you keep your curves gentle. If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own. Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth. Regular sandpaper will also remove sharp edges. Wear gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip.  If you use a grinder with glass, you should wear a mask and googles to keep pieces of glass from being breathed or settling in your eyes.You will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don't chip any of the pieces.   Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together. This way the pieces won't slip when you're foiling the glass. Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil. Make sure the foil is centered, otherwise it can look a little funky at the end.. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler.  Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. Make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. Press the foil down hard with tongue depressor, or other firm instrument. This will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. You will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. If a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again. While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary. However, it can make things easier for you in the long run.   Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. The gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use, although you can also try out the liquid form. Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. There are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly. You have to tack together your pieces, then you have to tin the seams, and finally you add the bead.  To tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. To tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams, then apply a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. Once a section is completely melted you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead. Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. You could use a zinc frame or a lead channel, which requires more soldering, exactly the same as the steps outlined above.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 540 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 540}, "function_call": "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 35 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 35}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(35, \"less than\")"]}}}

In recent years, the introduction of transformerbased Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) across various domains, including telecommunications [1, 2]. LLMs can condense information characteristics and transform vast knowledge into tokens, which can assist or even substitute human beings in conceptual comprehension, logical thinking, and decision-making. Language models have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks and exhibited significant algorithmic, reasoning, and analytical skills with minimal or no domain-specific adjustments [3]. This intuitively allows for the effective execution of network tasks via natural language interaction. Consequently, enhancing or optimizing the performance of networking-specific LLMs emerges as an important challenge. Huang et al. [2] highlighted the potential uses of LLMs in the networking field. LLMs have the potential to transform network design by analyzing large datasets, aiding in tasks such as equipment selection and network planning. They can also contribute significantly to network diagnosis by using network status data to create fault reports and provide processing suggestions. Moreover, for network configuration, LLMs could provide a unified natural language interface, simplifying the process and assisting in the management of diverse network devices. Finally, LLMs can interface with various security tools and systems, assisting in security evaluation and intrusion detection. Addressing these specialized issues with the help of LLMs necessitates the application of NLP tasks e.g., classification, summarization, question-answering, named entity recognition, relation extraction, etc. However, one major problem is the lack of high-quality datasets in this domain to train these language models. To address this problem, Bariah et al. [4] proposed a framework for adapting pre-trained generative models, specifically BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, to the telecom domain. The authors also demonstrated the efficiency of these fine-tuned models in classifying 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technical documents into relevant telecom categories and working groups. Another contribution to this domain is the proposal of SPEC5G dataset by Karim et al. [5]. The  the application of this dataset in tasks like security-related text classification and summarization, aimed at enhancing the understanding and analysis of complex 5G network protocols. In a practical contribution to this research area, Maatouk et al. [6] introduced TeleQnA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the knowledge of LLMs in telecommunications. In addition, Miao et al. [7] developed the NetEval questionanswering dataset, with a focus on network configurations, logs, and events. While supervised fine-tuned language models or zero-shot LLMs have shown impressive results in one or more tasks within the telecommunications field, a thorough evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs across this domain remains unexplored. To this end, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating typical NLP tasks in telecommunications research, such as text classification, summarization, and question-answering.             \fIn essence, the objective of this study is to enhance our comprehension of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the field of telecommunications, which can pave the way for developing new applications in this domain leveraging LLMs. The major contributions of this study are\u2014 \u2022 A comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of various LLMs within the telecommunications domain, revealing their capabilities and limitations across multiple tasks. \u2022 We also carry out a thorough error analysis and provide our observations on the specific areas that need improvement for each of these tasks.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\"); word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 3 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 3}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens and more than 540 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 560, "min_cnt": 540}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\"); word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"]}}}

If collecting sand from a beach, be wary of hazardous materials and waste.  Though you will later sift the sand, try to pick out noticeable things like paper or large pebbles. Be very careful when collecting sand from a beach.  Use rubber gloves as there may be broken glass or other hazardous materials. Store gathered sand in tightly sealed plastic bags.  Hold the bags upside down and see if any sand leaks out.  This will help you reduce unwanted sand in your car and house. Store-bought sand will be smooth and even, but beach sand often has rocks that need to be separated from the sand grains.  Place a bucket on the ground and put a sifter over top. This sifter could be an old sifter from the kitchen or fine netting, like a window screen, that is secured over the bucket using duct tape. If you are using a metal sifter from the kitchen, do not use it again for food-related preparation.  Pour the collected sand onto the mesh of the sifter or screen.  Shake the screen lightly so the sand will filter through into the bucket. You may need to occasionally clear the mesh of any stones, shells, or other debris. Continue this process until all the sand has been sifted. You can use plastic containers with lids or plastic storage bags.  Storage bags are best because they will require less cleanup and will reduce any additional mess caused during the stirring process. Baking dishes and bowls are also acceptable containers.  Be sure to thoroughly scrub any kitchenware afterward, especially if dying gathered sand.  You want to avoid leaving behind any sand or potentially hazardous materials in the sand. This will help evenly distribute the dye when you apply it later. Aim for a damp consistency and avoid soaking or submerging the sand completely.  Don't worry if you add too much water; this will simply making the drying process longer. Any kind of dye will work for this project, but fabric dye seems to produce the most vibrant dyed sand.  Food coloring is also acceptable for dying sand. You may need to add dye several times until it gets to the desired shade you like. The sand will dry lighter so do not worry if the dye is very dark. Dry tempera paint powder is a nice additive that helps create bright colors. Tempera powder can be purchased in most arts and crafts stores. Be cautious while handling dye as it can stain skin, clothing, and furniture. This process will vary depending on what container you have used to separate sand.  If you are using a container with a lid, you will need a plastic spoon that you can throw away after you finish the project. Scrape the sides of the container to make sure you color everything. Seal the container and set the wet sand to the side to soak up the dye for at least an hour. For a storage bag, simply seal the bag tightly and massage the sand until the color is consistent throughout. Set the bag aside for at least an hour so the sand can soak up the dye. Pour out any excess water first, then spread your damp sand on a plate or flat surface.  Leave the sand to dry, preferably in a sunny place, for a few hours. You may wish to put paper towels over the plate before putting the sand down to help soak up any excess dye. You can also bake the sand to help speed up the drying process and further infuse the colors.  Simply place the sand in a baking pan and bake on 200\u00a0\u00b0F (93\u00a0\u00b0C) for 15 minutes. Make sure you pull the sand out of the oven while it is still damp and let it dry naturally overnight; sand that has been baked completely dry can have faded and less vibrant colors. Once your dyed sand has completely dried, store it in dry plastic containers with easily sealed lids.  For safety purposes, store sealed sand outside of the kitchen.  You don't want to accidentally mistake it for a spice or cooking powder. Make sure you reseal the lids tightly after each sand art project.  This will keep unwanted materials from ruining the color as well as prevent accidental spills inside the house.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(540, \"less than\"); word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 540 tokens and more than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 540, "min_cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(540, \"less than\"); word_count_check(520, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 16 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 5th, and 29th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [5, 29]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.6, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"sand\", 5, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"dye\", 3, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"color\", 4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 28], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 29], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Before you debut your tag for the world to see, start off with something that\u2019s for your eyes only. Grow accustomed to using spray-paint where you won\u2019t be embarrassed by any mistakes or mishaps. Use a canvas that you can practice on and repaint as needed without being arrested, such as:  An actual large canvas A sheet of plywood A wall that belongs to you beforehand. Keep in mind that you want your tag to appear fluid and dynamic, regardless of how small or large it is. At the same time, realize that you will often need to move quickly to keep your lines nice and neat. Avoid mistakes that could be caused by a stiff body, aches, and cramps. Limber up beforehand. Also keep in mind:  This goes for your whole body, not just your arms. Expect your waist, hips, legs, and feet to have an impact on the quality of your work. The larger the surface area to be covered, the wider your range of motion will need to be. A larger canvas means you have to reach, lean, and bend to a greater degree, and more often. Expect the paint\u2019s ingredients to separate over time. Always give it a vigorous shake before you use it, even if you only set it aside for a few minutes. Check the directions on the can to see how long you should shake, both before its first use and (if mentioned) again after a short pause. If you don\u2019t shake it up, the consistency will be uneven. This means that it will be extremely thin at times (which makes for a weak coat), and thicker at others (which could cause clogs). If you need to attach a separate spray cap to your can, expect this to release some paint as you do so. Stay away from your canvas so it doesn\u2019t get any spray-back. Place your finger (or better yet, a loose strip of tape) over the cap\u2019s nozzle to catch what comes out. Remember that many paints have toxic ingredients. Even those that don\u2019t should never be inhaled or ingested. Wear protective gloves and mask to reduce this risk. Before you try your hand at spraying your tag, start with simple lines sprayed from various distances. Judge the effect of how near or far you stand from your canvas. Expect a wider dispersal the farther back your stand.  For neat, crisp lines, you need to work up close. For fades and shadows, you need more distance. Remember that the paint is going to dry immediately upon contact. Expect prolonged spraying over one area to result in a wet buildup. Avoid drips and runs by keeping the can in motion constantly, especially if you\u2019re aiming for very thin lines.  Again, some experimentation may be needed here. Constant motion is always key, but do some practice lines at various speeds to see what effect each has on your lines. Another reason not to dawdle is if you decide to tag some place without permission. Once you\u2019re confident in your spray-painting skills, decide where to apply them. Avoid the temptation to simply tag a surface on impulse. Think before you act. Things to consider include:  Whether the area has already been tagged, in which case you should choose another. How visible it is, since you may be better off improving your skills on less visible areas. If it\u2019s legal to tag this space, and if so, whose permission you need to obtain, if any. If it\u2019s illegal to do so, and if so, if you\u2019ll be easily noticed or caught.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}}}

The output should consist of fewer than 44 sentences and contain between 540 and 560 tokens. Each sentence should have more than three tokens:\n\nIn Japan, they call it \"juhachiban\", \"#18\" in South Korea and \"banquet song\" in Hong Kong, but you can just call it \"the song you're going to be totally awesome at\". You might be tempted to pick an obscure song that you're really passionate about, but when you're starting out, try to pick a song that many people are familiar with and enjoy. The audience will have more fun listening and cheering you on, which will make things easier for you!  Choose well-known songs that are in your range. Can you reach the high notes without screaming? Can you reach the low notes? Make sure the melody is easy to hum and that you can feel the rhythm easily. Learn the melody and study it as thoroughly as you would study any other subject. Record yourself and listen back. Taking time to write out all the words will help you memorize them quickly. Upbeat songs tend to be better crowd pleasers than slow songs. It should still be something that you enjoy singing along to, though, and make sure it's within your vocal range. \"Twist and Shout\" by the Beatles is a safe choice; for female vocals, go for ABBA, Gloria Gaynor, or Madonna; guys should look into Sinatra, and Tom Jones. As you gain your confidence, you can choose more challenging or lesser known music. If you can get your hands on a karaoke machine, use it! Otherwise, you can usually dig up the karaoke version of a popular song on the Internet, and lyrics are easy to find. Play the song often, and sing it all the time. Sing while you're cleaning, during commercials, as you're washing the dishes...Practice makes perfect. You want to get to the point where you know the song by heart.  Try to get the instrumental tracks on cassette or CD so you can sing along without hearing the other singer. If you always practice singing with someone else's voice, you will never learn to lead with your voice. Background tracks to the most popular songs are gener\u00adally available at record stores and media outlets. Go to the Internet if you can't find them in your town. When possible, practice while holding a microphone (or a hairbrush) since that's what you'll be doing when you perform. To improve your karaoke, listen to the song with headphones and record yourself singing along. When you play it back, how do you sound? If you have a full length mirror or, better yet, a camcorder, use it! Singing is a very physical activity and requires a power source. Support your voice tone the way you would support your body when you're lifting something heavy. Get your legs under you, tuck your hips under, and use strength from the lower part of your body\u2014as if you were lifting. Push the balls of your feet firmly into the floor. Try not to lift your chin; instead, keep your head rounded over the microphone with your chin lower in the front. This makes the tone sound warm and resonant. Actually think about what the words mean. It's surprising how much better we sound when we really mean what we're saying. Choose songs that are age-appropriate so you're not trying to be convincing in a song about your six kids and three divorces.

As new advancements constantly emerge, they bring with them opportunities and challenges that must be navigated thoughtfully. Whether it's the latest software development, hardware innovation, or a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, the pace of change is relentless, and keeping up requires dedication and agility.  \n\nCompanies that can swiftly adapt to these changes are often the ones that thrive, leveraging new tools and techniques to enhance their operations and offer innovative solutions to their clients. On the other hand, those that lag behind may find themselves struggling to compete in an increasingly competitive market. For individuals, staying informed and continuously upgrading their skills is essential to remain relevant and valuable in the workforce.\n\nMoreover, the integration of technology into everyday life has transformed how we communicate, work, and even relax. Social media platforms have redefined how we connect with others, offering unprecedented access to information and the ability to share our thoughts with a global audience. However, with these benefits come concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential for information overload.\n\nIn the workplace, technology has revolutionized the way we approach tasks and collaborate with colleagues. Cloud computing, for instance, allows teams to work together seamlessly, irrespective of geographical location, fostering a more flexible and dynamic work environment. Meanwhile, automation and machine learning have streamlined processes, reducing the need for repetitive manual tasks and enabling employees to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors.\n\nYet, this technological transformation is not without its drawbacks. The rapid pace of innovation can lead to job displacement, as machines and algorithms take over roles traditionally performed by humans. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of the workforce, with an emphasis on reskilling and upskilling to prepare for new opportunities in a tech-driven economy.\n\nEducation systems must also adapt to these changes, ensuring that students are equipped with the skills necessary to thrive in a digital world. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability should be prioritized alongside technical expertise, providing a well-rounded foundation for future success.\n\nDespite the challenges, the potential benefits of embracing technology are immense. From improving healthcare outcomes through advanced diagnostics to addressing environmental concerns with smart solutions, the possibilities are limitless. By harnessing the power of technology responsibly and ethically, we can work towards a future that is not only more advanced but also more equitable and sustainable.\n\nIn conclusion, the relentless march of technological progress presents both opportunities and obstacles. By staying informed, adaptable, and committed to lifelong learning, individuals and organizations can navigate this landscape effectively, reaping the rewards of innovation while mitigating its risks. The key lies in balancing the promise of technology with a mindful approach to its implementation, ensuring that its benefits are widely shared and its challenges thoughtfully addressed:\n\nExpressions used in a language are said to be vague if they do not convey a precise meaning. Sentences using vague expressions do not give rise to precise truth conditions (Kennedy, 2007). Consider the following sentence: \u201cThe patient was maintained on a high dose of insulin.\u201d Interpreting such statements is a problem since it is unclear what was the exact amount of insulin that was used. Gradability (Sapir, 1944; Lyons, 1977) is a semantic property that allows a word to describe the intensity of a measure in context, and thus enables comparative constructs. In the above example, the word high is said to be gradable since it conveys the meaning associated with the measure - amount. \nn\nn Gradable adjectives inherently possess a degree of vagueness and are used in a language to express epistemic uncertainties (Kennedy, 2007; Frazier et al., 2008). While judgments are strong in extreme cases, there exist borderline cases, where it is difficult to ascribe an adjective. In the above example, some amounts of insulin would be considered as a high dose by all, other amounts would never be considered a high dose, but there is a middle range where it can be difficult for even experts to judge, if it is a high dose. This is because, different experts may have differing thresholds for what constitutes a high dose. \nn\nn Broadly, gradable adjectives can be classified into two categories based on their interpretation as measure functions (Bartsch, 1975; Kennedy, 1999). Adjectives such as tall,heavy, expensive can be viewed as measurements that are clearly associated with a numerical quantity (height, weight, cost). In contrast, adjectives like clever, beautiful, naive are more complex and underspecified for the exact feature being measured. Gradable adjectives have been the focus of several recent studies (de Melo and Bansal, 2013; Ruppenhofer et al., 2014) in the NLP community. Gradablity is property not limited to adjectives and also extends to other parts of speech such as adverbs (Shivade et al., 2015; Ruppenhofer et al., 2015) (e.g., slightly, marginally), nouns (e.g., joy, euphoria), and also verbs (e.g., drizzling, pouring). \nn\nn In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in clinical text. Using a method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000), we identify the gradable adjectives in our dataset of clinical notes. We found that these adjectives have a substantial presence (30%) in our data. Further, we show that there is a specific pattern in which gradable adjectives are used: some medical concepts are more likely to be modified by these adjectives than others. Finally, we focus on a specific subset of gradable adjectives associated with measurements of numerical quantities and demonstrate the use of a simple computational model to ground their meaning.",

So, in early June I decided to do that again, thinking it may be my last chance to do spend that much time with my Grandmother and to also help give my uncle and his family a bit of a break from taking care of her. The day before I was to travel, I was given the news that my Grandmother was again in the hospital with pneumonia and that she wasn't \"like herself.\" I decided to visit anyway. When I got there, it was late, but I made my way into her room and she was asleep so I sat in a chair that was in the corner and slept until morning. In the morning, I said, \"Hey! Grandma!\"But while her eyes were open and she pivoted them towards me, they were distant. She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it. But then, suddenly, she started to regain her faculties and started to be able to talk and think more clearly like how I had remembered her. On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing. She had returned to how I remembered her in mind and spirit and we were able to really have a nice last day together before I had left. She's had issues since then however and I don't think she's been as good as that day and so I'm pretty protective and thankful for that moment/day I got to share with her.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 3th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 3]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 360, "min_cnt": 340}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 17 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.1818181818181818, "sft": 0.4615384615384615, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(350, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"My Grandmother is 94 years old\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"She is very weak and needs constant attention and help.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"help\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"help\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"writing\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Cut your grass frequently to keep them from infesting your yard. You should also trim any low-lying bushes and rake up any decomposing leaves. This will remove shady and damp sections of your yard, which fleas and ticks love.  Making the environment (your yard) uninhabitable for them is key to preventing them from attaching to your pet. Keep moist compost piles away from the house and outdoor play areas, like sandboxes and decks. Ticks do not like crossing paths lined with wood chips, mulch, or gravel. Place these path materials around the edges of your yard to prevent ticks from approaching your yard and home. The barrier should be 3 feet wide. Don't be tempted to leave wood piles along the edge of your house. Instead, keep them stacked in the sun since messy wooded areas can actually attract ticks. Don't let animals like stray cats, rodents, and deer gain access to your yard. These animals may bring fleas and ticks into your yard. To keep them out, place bird feeders and wood piles away from your house, set up fencing, block crawl spaces, and plant trees and plants that discourage deer. Plants that discourage deer include: boxwood, butterfly bush, ginkgo, and jasmine. Consult your local nursery for more planting ideas. These treatments disrupt the fleas\u2019 life cycle and keep them from reproducing. IGRs are considered safe for people and pets, but they are harmful to fish. Be careful if you're applying the regulator near a water source. This natural product can be used in your garden to kill fleas, ticks, or insects. It works by dehydrating and shredding their bodies after they ingest the powder. Be cautious when applying it. Always wear gloves and purchase food grade diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle it around the yard where you've seen fleas or ticks. Avoid touching diatomaceous earth with your hands, ingesting, or breathing it in. The very fine powder is actually very sharp and can irritate your skin or lungs, if you breathe it. When used correctly outdoors, it won't harm humans or pets. To determine if you have fleas in your yard, you can walk around your yard in white socks that are pulled up to your knee. If there are fleas, you will be able to see them on your socks. You can call an experienced professional exterminator or talk to your vet about less expensive environmental pesticides you can buy. For fleas, you'll need to spray areas of the yard where your pet usually rests (such as a kennel or dog house), under decks, and next to the foundation. For ticks, spray moist and shady areas of the yard.  If you do a good job of treating your pets and protecting your yard from fleas and ticks, you may not need to treat your yard with pesticides.  Never use Pyrethroid-, Permethrin-, or Amitraz-containing products on cats or in your yard. These products can cause severe side effects in cats, including death.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 21 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.75, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence contains fewer than 32 tokens. Do not alter the 16th and 19th sentences. The output should have more than 25 sentences:\n\nYou need to know exactly what you want to happen when you have the conversation. Do you want to go to a dance? Do you want a later curfew? Do you want to go out to a special dinner with your parents? Think about what you want from the conversation. It can even help to write it down. Make sure you have all the important details. Having details will help you answer questions. Answering questions will calm your parents down. For instance, if you want to spend the night at friend's house, you'll need to know if her parents will be there, when the night will start, what you'll need to bring, and when your parents can pick you up. It also might help to have a phone number for your friend's parents. That way, your parents can call her parents. You don't want to talk when your parents are busy. Pick a time when they have a moment to sit down with you. It should be a time when you can have their full attention. If you can't figure out a time, ask your parents when a good time would be. If you keep trying to draw it out, you're just going to get more nervous. As soon as you get your parents together, just begin what you have to say.  For instance, you could start by saying, \"I have something I want to discuss with you, and I hope you will keep an open mind. I'd like to go to the dance this Saturday night.\" If you absolutely can't get it out right away, it's okay to start the conversation with something else, as long as you get to the point eventually. A good way to convince someone to do something is to tell the person what good it will do them.Think about how your parents will benefit from what you are doing, and bring that up.  As an example, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out for a night, you could say, \"As an added bonus, you'd get the house all to yourself!\" Another example is if you're trying to get your parents to eat out somewhere, mention their favorite dishes. If you try to lie or give a half truth, your parents may not trust you in the future if they find out. Plus, they know you pretty well, so they can probably tell when you're lying. That is, you might have a tendency to blame your parents. Most people do in serious conversations. However, you should try to stick to what you're feeling or thinking, not what you blame your parents for. In other words, use \"I\" instead of \"you.\" Say, \"I feel upset when I can't go out when my friends do,\" not \"You're awful for not letting me go out with my friends.\" The second one puts your parents on their guard, while the first one just expresses what you're feeling. If you can, have details to back up what you say. As noted in the previous section, having details about where you're going is important. But it's equally important to have details in other conversations, too. Having someone with more authority than you, such as one of your friend's parents, a teacher, or a researcher through an article, to back you up can help persuade your parents. For instance, if you're trying to convince your parents that you should be in the band, you could have research articles stating how music can help you do better in math. You could say, \"As this research shows, being in band can help me do better in math. I'll let you have these pages so you can read up on it.\" If you are trying to get your parents to do something they don't want to do, then hearing why may help you.

The output must include over 25 sentences:\n\nSince ChatGPT was officially launched on November 30, 2022, it has quickly become one of the most popular intelligent Chatbot Van Dis et al. [2023], Stokel-Walker and Van Noorden [2023]. Since its inception, ChatGPT has been applied in multiple fields such as code correction Surameery and Shakor [2023], public health Som S [2023], and global warming Biswas [2023]. In July 2023, OpenAI released the Code Interpreter plugin, further enhancing ChatGPT\u2019s data parsing capabilities and addressing the natural weaknesses of large language models in mathematics and language. These developments have provided new inspiration for improving the intelligence and generalization of AI in the field of intelligent wargame simulation, that is, using ChatGPT self generated AI to make intelligent decisions in war games. Although the development and application of rule AI and data-driven AI Cheng et al. [2021]is the starting point in the field of intelligent wargame, data-driven AI has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years, in which Reinforcement learning AI has made a series of breakthroughs. In terms of data-driven AI, Liu Man, Zhang Hongjun, and others have designed a wargame decision-making framework that balances rules and data Liu et al. [2020a]. In terms of Reinforcement learning AI, Li Chen\u2019s team from Nanjing University of Science and Technology designed a multi-agent decision-making method under the Actor Critical framework and achieved good intelligence Chen et al. [2021]. Xu Jiale, Zhang Haidong, and others designed a CNN based strategy learning model to improve the accuracy of wargame situation prediction Xu et al. [2022]. Tencent\u2019s AI Lab used Deep reinforcement learning to achieve game confrontation in the King\u2019s Glory game, and defeated professional players Ye et al. [2020], Chen et al. [2020]. In a word, with the deepening of the combination of deep learning, Reinforcement learning and intelligent wargame, the intelligence of agents has been continuously improved Mnih et al. [2015], Silver et al. [2016], Vinyals et al. [2019], Liu et al. [2020b]. Although rule AI does not require a long period of training, due to its limitations in rules, the upper limit of intelligence level is difficult to break through the upper limit of rules; While data-driven AI and Reinforcement learning AI improve their intelligence and flexibility by processing large amounts of data through Reinforcement learning algorithms, their interpretability is poor, and it is difficult to achieve model migration under scenario and capture point changes SUN et al. [2022], Wurman et al. [2022], Schrittwieser et al. [2020], Silver et al. [2018]. Therefore, improving the intelligence and generalization of AI in the field of intelligent wargame becomes the focus of further research. Moreover, the decision-making of adversarial games is complex and continuous. In order to make decisions more intelligent and generalized, this article focuses on introducing a self generated AI wargame architecture based on a large language model. Create a decision-making mechanism that involves multiple generative agents interacting, mimicking human behavior and generating interpretable, credible, and highly generalizable game adversarial intelligent decisions. The core work of this article is as follows: 1. The self generated AI wargame architecture is an intelligent agent architecture centered on a large language model. This architecture consists of multiple generative agents, each with its own large language model (this article uses ChatGPT as the driving tool). These intelligent agents can communicate and cooperate with each other through reflective and memory streams, and jointly make decisions. By talking to each other, they can share information, analyze the situation, and make inferences and decisions based on the conversation content. 2. Build a two-layer agent task planning model, targeting strategic agents and tactical agents to plan tasks for the game confrontation process. Strategic agents describe specific situations observed by all current agents. Planning refers to task allocation and execution based on all observed situational information. The tactical agent only focuses on the situation observed by a single agent chess piece and executes related tasks according to the strategic planning agent. However, tactical agents can also have their own judgments and feedback based on the prompts issued by strategic agents. 3. Taking wargame as the experimental platform, the experiment shows that the intelligent decision-making ability of the large language model is significantly stronger than reinforcement learning AI and rule AI, and the intelligence, understandability, and generalization are all better. And through experiments. Meanwhile, research has found that providing prior knowledge from experts in the field specifically to large language models can significantly improve their intelligence.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 660 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 660}, "function_call": "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 41 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 41}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")"]}}}

As one would expect, it was a very significant step, and a very special moment in my life.  We opted to not go too overboard, and had under 100 guests total.  Everything went very well, and the memory of that day will stay in my mind, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life.  Besides our immediate family, I had my best friend come up from across the country to be my best man. I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. I don't get to see him too often, so when I do I take full advantage and try to enjoy every moment as much as possible.  Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents were there as well, as they are very important to me.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of people we had there, and probably felt as loved and important as I ever have in my life on account of all the people there. The only part that was a bit bothersome was with it being a wedding, and so many people, I didn't get much time to chat with each person, as I would have liked to. I've come to realize that's just how weddings are with so many people and only so much time, that it's part of the gig.  But beyond that, it was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed myself a great deal. My wife looked gorgeous (as usual), and I am overly thankful to spend the rest of my life with her.  The photographer did an excellent job, and I helped her out by being a joker and keeping people laughing and smiling which helped with pictures. It was a great day, and I am still ecstatic that I got to share our special day with such great people.  The caterer did fantastic, and the venue we used was absolutely perfect, and extremely affordable.

I was kind of surprised when I came back to the apartment after spending the weekend with my folks to see that they had moved all their stuff out.  I mean Sally was actually there cleaning up the bathroom.  She looked at me really flustered and angry.  I asked her \"whats up\", she huffs on how I'm such a procrastinator and she's doing all the cleaning because Tasha is ghosting her.  I asked Sally, what are you talking about?  Did we get robbed? Where's all your stuff? and then \"Oh, didn't Tasha tell you, that we have to be out of the apartment by Tuesday?\"  Honestly, my jaw dropped.  I don't know why it did, its not like Tasha was the best roommate, her communication sucked.  So here it is Sunday night and I'm panicked.  I clearly did not plan on moving and now I have a 24 hour window to find something!  So I went down to the mail room and found some empty boxes, I should at least box my things up, while I send out text messages to see whose got a room available or knows of anything I can rent for the next semester.  I texted my parents to, my dad said it was a blessing in disguise.  Sally did all the cleaning and Tasha was already gone, so I just had a small section to pack up.  My dad is always very calm and reassuring, it helped.  I don't know why I hadn't panicked yet, I mean there was a rumored housing shortage both on and off campus.  Yet, I knew a lot of kids were graduating this year and hopefully someone hadn't given up their space.Phil had graduated last year and was working for a small boutique law firm in outside the city, he rented this super cute artist studio in a idyllic neighborhood.  Well it turns out Phil, had actually spent the summer applying to law firms back on the east coast and this morning he signed a contract with a new firm and started the following week.  Phil was offering me, his studio, his landlord agreed to a small rent increase, but it was a still a screaming deal and I was ecstatic.  I spent the whole day, filling up my small car with boxes, to and from storage.  I only packed what I, myself could carry.  My arms and shoulders hurt, my legs hurt from all the up and down motion.

Maybe you've lost the spirit of Christmas,  many others have, too. The over-commercialization of the holiday has sapped the pleasure from what should be a joyous time. It doesn't have to be that way. Whatever your reason for the season, nothing can kill the holiday spirit quicker than being crushed against the front of a store by gun-wielding mobs of bargain-crazed shoppers.  Shop at the stores of local producers. Most of the things you can find in malls and big box stores are mass-produced, cheaply-produced junk anyway. Giving junk as gifts is almost as soul-sapping as being in shopping mob. There are many gifts that fall outside the world of Christmas: handmade jewelry; artisan meats, breads, and cheeses; charitable gifts that donate money to a cause, given in the recipient's name; even gifts of things that you make well yourself, whether that's a hand-knit sweater, a work of art, a delicious dinner, or more. Simply ask yourself what you do well, and offer a bit of that as a gift. Now, imagine your best Christmas ever. It might have been when Santa got you that bike as a kid, or maybe that Christmas Eve that he proposed to you. Ask yourself: why was that special, and what did it feel like?  If it was simply that sense of wonder and how it felt like everybody was \"nicer\" somehow, then actively seek where that is happening. If it's the look of delight on children's faces, go find the best Santa in town, and soak in the total belief in a magic elf who delivers presents to children all over the world. Keep a smile on your face, and walk with your head up, making eye contact as much as you can. Greet everybody\u2014young and old, even people you might instinctively dislike\u2014with a hearty \"Merry Christmas.\" You may not even believe it yourself at first, but give it some time and effort. It doesn't matter if you have a house full of kids, or are just on your own. Enjoy the trappings of the season in any way you can.  If you have the space, head to the hills and harvest a tree. If that's not possible in your area, head to the local parking lot stuffed with trees. Either way, get one a couple weeks before Christmas, turn on the Christmas music, put up the tree, and decorate it. Your home will smell like Christmas, and it's hard to be unmoved by that! Add a wreath to your front door, so that every time you come home that's the first thing you'll see. It may be in the form of Christmas cards, or through the telephone or the Internet, if they're not nearby. If you Skype or do a Google Hangout with video, set it up if you can so that your Christmas tree is in the background, all lit up. \"Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings!\" Whether your tastes run towards the traditional Miracle on 34th Street, the classics like A Christmas Carol by Dickens (or it's modern comedic take with Scrooged), stop-motion animations like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer or Nightmare Before Christmas, or cult classics like A Christmas Story, holiday television is filled with nostalgia, humor, morality plays, and lots of simple, fun entertainment. It's the season of candy canes, eggnog, pumpkin pies, mulled drinks, and roasted foods. Whether you do it  yourself, or pick up some yummies at the grocery store, the aromas from the kitchen combine with the aromas of the evergreens that can transport you back in time to that best Christmas ever! Even if the kitchen is anathema to you, try it\u2014make a batch of your favorite cookies, for you and your family. Snickerdoodles, peanut butter cookies, or just plain old sugar cookies are all good. And if you have kids, help them decorate those tasty morsels. If you dread the holidays because of all the work that has to be done\u2014cooking, cleaning, wrapping, cleaning, more cooking, more cleaning, shopping, more cleaning...stop!  Share the load. If you have a spouse, make a plan. If you do the cooking, your spouse does the cleaning. If you do the shopping, they do the wrapping. Most Christmas chores are like that, so take advantage of your spousal unit to lessen the load. If you have kids, they can do the cleaning\u2014and you have the perfect leverage.

With EQs you can either strip or boost high or low frequencies, which can be particularly useful with drum kits. When drum kit sounds are recorded, the vibrations caused by its low frequencies can resonate with other parts of the kit. This might cause a rumble in the kits snare, for example. These sounds can be \"rolled off\" at the low end with an EQ, creating a purer sound. Where percussion is concerned, snare drums generally sound more powerful with a boost in the lower frequencies, whereas hi-hats and toms often sound snappier and punchier with lower frequencies thinned out. A compressor limits the amount of frequency expressed in your mix. It will raise the volume of quiet parts, lower the volume of loud parts, and maintain the volume of sounds in your ideal range. Due to human error, you can expect that no single instrument will not be perfectly constant throughout an entire recording. Compression can smooth these irregularities automatically for you. Drums and bass form the rhythmic foundation of your song, so be sure you set aside some time to give these a careful listen. Lower frequency sound can be overpowering if you're not careful. Every part should sound distinct, but also cohesive with the whole. If one instrument is excessively bright or dark, it will sound out of place. Think of the tracks of your mix as members of a choir: each part is separately appreciable, but its goal is work together as a collective. Noise gates cut out all noise that doesn't reach a minimum volume. This can be highly useful when a recording has been done in an area with background noise. The buzz of this noise can easily be cut out with a gate.  For specific instruments that aren't as regularly occurring in your mix, it may be easiest to lower your fader. Filtering out unwanted lower volume percussion can be unreasonably difficult when trying to time fading with each sound's \u201cpunch.\" Gate's are ideal for this situation. Experiment with noise gates to get a cleaner, crisper sound from your mix. How sound moves through the stereo field has a definite effect on the sound you produce in your mix. To find the perfect balance, you'll have to experiment with how you distribute your tracks. Beginners should start with a centered bass part, but then might:  Switch off between sides with rhythm guitar and percussion Place a keyboard track so it is slightly off center. Add other tracks throughout the field to give your mix a richer, more realistic quality. The chorus effect, for example, will add layers of slightly different timbres and intonations to a track, making it sound like multiple instruments are playing. As a general rule, this effect is useful for electric keyboards and guitar parts. Some other effects you might make use of while mixing:   Reverb - creates a vibration in the sound, often added to guitars and voice to mask less desirable frequencies and create fullness.  Delay - sometimes called \"echo,\" creates one or more defined sound segments and repeats that segment. There are many different kinds of automation you can be use to improve the musicality of your mix. For example, you might automate your master bus to create louder choruses than your verses. This would create a more prominent chorus in your mix. You can also automate effects returns, which can be useful if you want a reverb or a delay to be less prominent in certain sections of a song. While you're using your EQ, noise gates, and other effects, you should constantly be listening to your entire production. As you do, make small adjustments to each track while always keeping the whole in mind. With each change, listen to you mix anew. Even if individual parts sound great, the complete product has to sound great as well. There are many technical parameters and ranges defined by experts that can blind you to new approaches you might take to achieve your sound. Good sound is a matter of taste.

Each sentence should have more than 8 words:\n\nThe title can contain significant clues about the nature of the poem, so you really shouldn't ignore it. Read the title and think about it in the context of the rest of the poem. Ask yourself, What does the poem mean in the context of the rest of the poem? How does the title deepen the meaning of the poem overall? Sometimes the title will describe who the speaker or intended audience of the poem is, for example, a poem with the title \u201cFor Mother\u201d or \u201cTo My Lover.\u201d Other times, the title may describe the subject, genre, or tone of the poem, for example, the title \u201cSonnet 18\u201d or \u201cDigging.\u201d The poet and the speaker are not always the same person. A poem's speaker might be a character within the broader context of the poem. Note if the poet uses a first person speaker (\u201cI\u201d), a second person speaker (\u201cyou\u201d), or a third person speaker (\u201cshe, he, they\u201d). You can usually identify the speaker without careful analysis, but if you aren't sure, don't worry about it for now. Just make sure you understand what type of speaker is in the poem when you start analyzing the meaning of the poem. When you run across a word you don't understand, stop where you're at and look up the meaning of that word in a dictionary. You may circle these words or underline them so you can remember to look them up later. Defining unfamiliar words can help to deepen your understanding of the poem.  You may also want to look up possible synonyms for that word using a thesaurus. After defining that word, plug the definition or synonym into the poem and re-read the line with that meaning. You can apply this same practice to phrases or proper nouns you don't know, but defining the meaning of these elements may require additional research in other texts or online. The tone and mood of the poem are often created by the word choice and the language used in the poem. You may also get a sense of the mood and tone of the poem by listening to the rhythms of the poem when you read it out loud. For example, you may have a poem that has a humorous tone and a light mood, such as the poem \u201cDirty Face\u201d by Shel Silverstein. Or you may read a poem that has a more sinister or ominous tone, such as \u201cThe Raven\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe. You should get a sense of when the poem was written and why the poem was written, or the context of the poem. Maybe an historical event occurred around the time the poem was written or perhaps a certain style of poetry was popular when the poem was published. Maybe the poet was influenced by a certain painting or art performance when they wrote the poem. Learning about the context of the poem can help to deepen your understanding of the poem and provide a more thorough reading of the piece. You may do research on the context of the poem using other texts, scholarly journals, or online sources. You can also consider when the poem was published and use this date to help situate it within the history of poetry and writing. Patterns and repetition in the poem are often used to reinforce a certain theme or idea. The poet may use a line more than once throughout the poem like a refrain to remind the reader of a certain idea. Or they may use a pattern of words or a pattern of organization to create a certain meaning in the poem. Ask yourself if the poet consistently relies on certain images, topics, or other similar words. Groups of similar words to indicate a pattern. For example, you may notice that the poem repeats the same line over and over again throughout the poem, such as \u201conly this and nothing more.\u201d You may then consider why the poet repeats this phrase throughout the poem. Often, the phrase will relate back to a specific theme or idea in the poem. Another pattern you could look for is how the ideas in the poem are ordered. Are they placed in a chronological order, moving from present to future? Or do the ideas jump around in time, moving from past to present to future and then back to past?  You may also notice if the poem does not have any time based ordering and instead seems ordered by another organizing idea, such as scraps of conversation in the poem or the use of another theme. For example, maybe the poem has a water-based theme, with the poet describing an ocean in one line and shallow pond in the next. Or maybe the poem has a theme of lost love, and each stanza explores a moment of lost love for the speaker. Once you have considered all the elements of form and content in the poem, you should try to summarize the poem in one to two sentences. Write down what you believe to be the overall meaning or theme of the poem. Try to rely on the content and form of the poem as well as your impressions and thoughts. Ask yourself, What is this poem about?

I had pulled my vastus medialis, the inner quad, and caused damage to my sartorius, the longest muscle in the body.\"The year was off to good start. My finances were up 30% and February was looking to be a fun month with a weekend getaway with my lady on my birthday.  It was about a week into February when I hit the legs pretty hard. I should have taken a short rest period that week but decided to go hard one more week. This, unfortunately, was a bad decision. After the intense gym session, my legs were tight. As I was leaving and getting into the car, I felt a relieving pop followed by extreme pain once I arrived at my destination. I kept thinking I was just tired, maybe worked it too hard, and then kept doing normal activity stuff that night. By the time I made it back to my house, I could barely walk or drive. When I stepped my foot outside the car to get out of the car, a sudden pop came from the inner part of my knee.  It was the worst feeling ever. I had to lay bed for at least 3 to 4 entire days and could barely even make it to the restroom. I had to have my lady come over and assist me to a bath. Then I was able to get her to get my crutches from the garage. I'm glad I kept those things! Finally I was mobile but far from walking. about 6-8 weeks go by while I'm beginning to master the crutches. I could even use on to push the gas pedal at times because driving was so difficult. Finally the crutches were not need anymore and started my long journey to recovery.  Everything was progressing and healing until I twisted my torso one day rolling over and pulled another muscle that overlaps the first one I tore at the gym. That set me back another 4-6 weeks. All in all, its been about 7 months and I'm still recovering but can function about 80% normal now. I'd say that's a hell of a significance from stuck in bed in excruciating pain. In another month's time I think I'll be able to get back on some hiking trails just in time to see the leaves fall and change color.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 360 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 360}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666665}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], \"unchange\")"]}}}

And if she is, she'll be sending out subtle signs that she likes you. It can be hard to tell if a girl is flirting, so carefully observe her body language for these common signs of flirting:  She's constantly touching you. She might touch your shoulder or arms while talking to you. Maybe she'll lean in close and rest her body against yours. There'll be many excuses or reasons why both of you are always touching. She smiles at you a lot. She might catch your eye across the room and give you a sweet, unsolicited smile. She draws attention to her body. She might bite her lip, fix her hair, or cross and uncross her legs. She may be doing these things unconsciously or purposely, but all these subtle moves draw your attention to a specific part of her body. She gives you special hugs. If she's not a hugger, then it's easy to tell when she's giving a hug reserved especially for you. It's an excuse to get closer to you and an affectionate expression. Even if you're not sure it's a special hug, be happy you're receiving such a nice gesture from her. An interested girl will attempt to give you subtle suggestions through her speech. So it's important to learn to read between the lines. A simple \u201chello\u201d could have seductive intentions if you listen closely enough to the way she says it.  She laughs at your dumb jokes. You might tell the same joke to your friends and get a nice laugh or two, but when she hears it, it's hilarious. She wants you to feel like the star of the show, but don't get this mixed up with awkward laughter. She compliments you a lot. According to her, you're really funny, kind, and have nice hair. However, some girls might do the complete opposite and insult you. This is an age-old flirting technique used by almost everyone. It lowers the self-esteem of the target and oddly makes the insulter seem much more attractive.. But don't mistake this for a girl who is truly disinterested in you. A few light-hearted insults does not harm, but if she's giving consistently hurtful insults, then it probably means she doesn't like you. She might change drastically around you. Whether she becomes nervous or extremely aloof or flirtatious, a change in behaviour often signifies that she feels differently about you.  You can usually tell what her normal behaviour is like when she's around her friends. If you can, observe her behaviour without her knowing that you're in the room. Watch if she changes once she notices you. She might straighten up, become quiet and serious, or be very happy to see you. Watch how her friends react around you. If they're whispering, giggling, or sneaking glances at you, it's likely you were the subject of their conversation and they're checking you out. Don't assume a change in behaviour means she's into you. She could be playing hard to get, or is just genuinely not interested. If you're still not sure, take a turn at the game. It works even better if you know she's playing hard to get or is actually interested in you.  Flirt with her sparingly. Keep her guessing if you're really interested in her. It's fun for both of you and keeps things fresh and entertaining. Stay mysterious. Drop hints about yourself to keep her curious about who you are. You'll look intriguing and more attractive. Some girls, even if they're the ones playing hard to get, might not appreciate this approach. After all, the point of playing hard to get is to force the person you're interested in to work harder for you - not less. Instead, play by her rules and show her just how much you'll do to win her affection. Ultimately, you should let her decide how to let you know whether or not she likes you. The worst thing you can do is become obsessed with wanting to be with her. This can lead to incidents of harassment on your part.   No means no.

I had stopped at the gas station to buy us something to drink as well as snacks, and had just pulled out of the gas station. We got about five minutes down the road when we hit back to back traffic. I was looking down at my phone trying to change the song, and had not been paying attention to the fact that the car in front of me had stopped because of the traffic. I rear ended them and tried to  quickly put my foot on the breaks, but due to the impact I ended up hitting them a second time. The impact also caused them to hit the car in front of them. We pulled over to the side of the road, where I saw that although the front end of my car was completely messed up and pushed in, both of the other cars were fine, and only had a few noticeable scratches, if that. My car was not safe to drive due to fluids leaking out of the engine, and the tow truck that took my car said my car was basically totaled, and it would most likely be too costly if I were to try to get the car fixed, since I would already have to pay a bit of money for them towing the car and taking it to the auto shop that towed it. I ended up just paying them and letting them keep the car at their junkyard. Due to my car being totaled I have been out of a car for the past few months, and although I am now working from home at the moment, I was unable to do the job I had originally been working doing, as I used my car travelling to different stores doing audits. I am still without a car at the moment due to the accident. The job I am working now has just started so I do hope I am able to buy a new car at the end of the month. Due to this accident I have had issues with getting basic things done like grocery shopping and running errands. I have been either dependent on family members or on Lyft or Uber to get around, which is a bit of an inconvenience at times. I cannot just go where I want exactly when I need to, and it also costs quite a bit of money getting around if I use Lyft or Uber, which has become very expensive.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 280 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 280}, "function_call": "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 14 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 14}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"car\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(13, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"less than\")"]}}}

After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 9th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 9]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 9], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 16 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.4, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 9], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"drink\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"of\", \"remove\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"]}}}

Ensure the output has fewer than 26 sentences:\n\nThe task of machine comprehension concerns the automatic extraction of answers from a given passage. Often, the relevant information required to answer a question is distributed across multiple sentences. Understanding the relation(s) between these sentences is key to finding the correct answer. Consider the example in fig. 1. To answer the question about why Sally put on her shoes, we need to infer that She put on her shoes and She went outside to walk are connected by a causality relation. \n\nPrior work has demonstrated the value of discourse relations in related applications such as question answering (Jansen et al., 2014). Traditionally, however, these approaches rely on outputs from off-the-shelf discourse analyzers, using them as features for target applications. Such pipeline designs provide limited opportunities for guiding the discourse parser based on the requirements of the end task. Given a wide spectrum of discourse frameworks (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Prasad et al., 2008; Wolf and Gibson, 2005), it is not clear a priori what the optimal set of discourse annotations is for the task. Moreover, a generic discourse parser may introduce additional errors due to the mismatch between its training corpus and a dataset used in an application. In fact, the largest discourse treebanks are based on newspaper corpora (Prasad et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2002), which differ significantly in style from text used in machine comprehension corpora (Richardson et al., 2013). \n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach for incorporating discourse structure into machine comprehension applications. Rather than using a standalone parser that is trained on external supervised data to annotate discourse relations, the model induces relations between sentences while optimizing a task-specific objective. This design biases the model to learn relations at a granularity optimized for the machine comprehension task. In contrast to a generic discourse analyzer, our method can also utilize additional information available in the machine comprehension context. For instance, question types provide valuable cues for determining discourse relations, and thus can facilitate learning. \n\nWe implement these ideas in a discriminative log-linear model with hidden variables. The model jointly identifies relevant sentences, establishes relations between them, and predicts an answer. Since the same set of sentences can give rise to multiple questions, we do not limit the model to a single discourse relation, but rather model a distribution over possible relations. During training, we only have access to questions and gold answers. Since relevant sentences and their relations are not known, we model them as hidden variables. To guide the model towards linguistically plausible discourse relations, we add a few seed markers that are typical of each relation. The model predicts relations not only based on the sentences, but also incorporates information about the question. By decomposing the dependencies between model components, we can effectively train the model using a standard gradient descent approach. \n\nWe evaluate our model using a recently released machine comprehension dataset (Richardson et al., 2013). In this corpus, roughly half of the questions rely on multiple sentences in the passage to generate the correct answer. For baselines, we use the best published results on this dataset. Our results demonstrate that our relation-aware model outperforms the individual baselines by up to 5.7% and rivals the performance of a state-of-the-art combination system. Moreover, we show that the discourse relations it predicts for sentence pairs exhibit considerable overlap with relations identified by human annotators.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 24 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 12th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 12]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.75, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 12], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

During a fast break, for instance, offensive players usually don't have time to stop moving, calmly line up their shot, and make it when they're ready \u2014 instead, they either have to drive straight to the hoop and go for a lay-up or make a jump shot immediately. When a player goes straight from running into making a jump shot in one fluid motion without any pause, this is called a \"pull-up jumper\". Once mastered, this skill is a valuable one, as it allows you to make shots from virtually anywhere around the basket without giving the defense any time to react. To make a pull-up jumper, start off by dribbling at a fast jog or run down the middle of the court. As you near the free throw line, flare out a few feet to the side. Come to a balanced stop in rhythm with your steps as you bring the ball up into both hands. Without hesitating, immediately get low, jump, and shoot. Practice until you can pull this move off quickly without stopping at any point. What do you do when you get the ball off of a pass and a defender is immediately right behind you, blocking your path to the hoop? One way to get out of this situation is to use a technique called a turnaround shot. In a turnaround shot, the player with the ball pretends to go one way, then spins in the opposite direction and shoots as soon as he's facing the hoop. Most of the time, this will give him a small window during which he can shoot without the defender blocking him. To shoot a turnaround shot, start with your back to the hoop and a defender guarding you closely from behind. Back towards the hoop as you dribble and stay low until you're a comfortable shooting distance away from it. Take a step in the direction of your throwing hand as you drop your non-shooting foot back slightly. Quickly pivot around on your non-shooting foot and make your jump shot immediately. Many of the NBA's all-time greatest players had masterful fadeaway jump shots. As their name hints at, fadeaway shots are jump shots made when a player jumps and leans backward. This technique brings the ball away from the defender, giving the shooter extra room to shoot and making the shot very tough to guard against. However, it can be very hard to make fadeaway shots, so they're often seen as the mark of an excellent (or selfish) player.  To make a fadeaway, start an ordinary jump shot or a turnaround shot as you normally would. As you jump, push yourself upward and backward, putting space between yourself and the player behind you. Lean back with your spine for extra space. Square up with the hoop in the air and hold the ball just above your head. When you reach the highest point of your jump, shoot the ball with a snapping motion of the wrist. Note that fadeaways require much more wrist strength than ordinary shots because much of the power from the legs that would ordinarily be used for the shot is spend propelling the shooter backwards. An important part of having a great jump shot is knowing when not to shoot. By carefully interspersing your shots with the occasional fakeout, you can keep defenders on their toes. More importantly, however, is the fact that a convincing fake can open up shooting opportunities when you're being guarded by a defender that just won't leave you alone.  To make a pump fake, get low as you normally would just before taking a shot. Bring the ball up in front of you and prepare to jump. Start to rise up, but stop yourself just short of actually jumping. If your defender falls for your fake and jumps, either quickly dart around him or time your own jump so that you shoot just as he's hitting the ground to give yourself a free shot. It's important to stay in contact with the floor during your pump fake. Taking even a small hop without shooting constitutes an \"up-and-down\" penalty in basketball.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 9th, and 31th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [9, 31]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 0.75, "sft": 0.7272727272727273, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"make shots from virtually anywhere around the basket without giving the defense any time to react.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"pull-up jumper\", 1, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9, 31], \"unchange\")"]}}}

She also suffers from Fibromyalgia which was going to make the treatment much worse than it already is. She started the first round of chemo on a Monday and we spent 4 hours and 30 minutes in the infusion center. She was sent home with a battery operated pack that pumped chemo into her port 24 hours per day. Two days later (Wednesday) she woke and was very weak and very sick and a bit delusional. I had to leave for about 30 minutes to get her some medicine and when I got home she was so sick and in and out delusional that I decided to call 911 to take her to the hospital. Our bedroom is upstairs and I tried to help her out of bed to make it easier for the EMT's but she was dead weight even though she only weighs 128lbs. They arrived in about 10 minutes. Our little 3 month old puppy was downstairs in her kennel and was very nervous at everything that was going on. It was all so sudden but I tried to stay calm and figure out everything I had to do even though my first concern was my wife. Everything had to be moved out of the way so they could get the stretcher in the from door and up the steps. I had called my wife's daughter and she was on her way to our house and got there just about the same time as the ambulance. By this time my wife was quite delusional and had no idea what was going on or where she was. It was frantic. Three of them loaded her on the stretcher while I was giving a fourth all the pertinent information to be entered into a computer. I said I wanted to ride in the ambulance but they told me it was against regulations. They drove off with her with her daughter following in her car. I said I'd be right there. All of a sudden it hit me that I had to to something with our puppy. I heard a voice behind me saying \"sir, sir\". I turned around and there was a woman with a young boy and she said \"we live 2 doors down and if there's anything we can do to help, just let us know.\" I explained to her a little of what was happening and asked if there was any way she could watch our puppy. I didn't know what time I'd be coming home from the hospital. She said they would be happy to, not to worry and they would take care of the puppy for as long as I needed. I gave her the keys to my house and thanked her profusely.

These models achieve state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual transfer and many mul(cid:63) Equal Contribution, \u00b6 Work done while at Amazon. tilingual NLP tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Pires et al., 2019). However, a real-world system will encounter real-world noise, such as linguistic variations and common errors observed in textual data, that are often absent from benchmark datasets. While prior works focused on this issue of robustness in monolingual settings (Peng et al., 2021; Sengupta et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020), investigation has been scarce for multilingual settings. In this paper, we study the effect of realistic noise in multilingual settings and propose methods to boost the robustness of multilingual language models across four NLP tasks: Intent Classi\ufb01cation (IC), Slot Labeling (SL), Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Due to the lack of multilingual noisy evaluation data, we synthesize benchmarks by mining noise from publicly available corpora and injecting them into the test sets associated with each of the four tasks. We conduct human validation to ensure that this noised data is indeed realistic (see examples from MultiATIS++ in Figure 1) and identify the variety of noise-types seen across languages (in \u00a73). These analyses highlight the potential of our testset in evaluating (and motivating future research on) multilingual robustness. To benchmark the performance of multilingual systems, we consider accuracy metrics on two utterance-level tasks (IC% and NLI%) and F1scores on two token-level classi\ufb01cation tasks (SLF1 and NER-F1). Speci\ufb01cally, we seek to evaluate the model\u2019s performance on the noised version of the test datasets in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting. In this scenario, we have training data for a task available only in one language (in our case, English) and test-data in various languages (Liu et al., 2019, 2020). While training data augmentation increases model robustness for monolingual (i.e. English) settings, it is not immediately obvious if these robustness gains can transfer across languages, as 22 b e F1 ] L C . s c [ v84.12 : v i X r a             \fFigure 1: MultiATIS++ test set injected with real-world noise mined from Wikipedia edits. The highest error injection ratio found to be realistic by human experts is shown alongside the realistic utterance percentage. We do not include the noisy test sets for Chinese and Japanese in our analysis owing to low (< 95%) realism. error types can often be language-speci\ufb01c. For example, typos in Devanagari script can differ from those seen in Latin scripts (e.g. (cid:45)(cid:107)(cid:1) (cid:108) \u2192 (cid:115)(cid:107)u(cid:108) in Devanagari showcases that a joined character is incorrectly separated into two characters in the word \u2018school\u2019). Thus, to improve the robustness of pretrained multilingual models across noise in all languages, we propose Robust Constrastive Pretraining (RCP) that couples multilingual noisy data-augmentation with a contrastive learning loss term during pretraining; this encourages the model to develop similar representations for the original and the noised version of a sentence. On the noisy test sets, our method improves the multilingual model performance across all metrics and multilingual tasks\u2013 IC% by 4.9% on MultiATIS++, 4.1% on MultiSNIPS; SL-F1 by 18.4 on MultiATIS++, 8.6 on MultiSNIPS; NER-F1 by 2.9 on WikiANN; NLI% by 0.7% on XNLI.

Get to know how the head, body, mane, tail, etc. of a horse look. Also learn about where the legs of a horse are positioned when they are moving. This will help to create a realistic horse, and is also helpful when you don't have a picture for a reference. Start with a few ovals and circles for the body. Make the head by drawing a large oval or circle, then a small circle near it for the muzzle. Connect them with two lines to make a head shape. Then use two lines to connect the head and body. This will create the neck. For the legs, draw straight lines, with circles for the joints. Add a curved line for the tailbone. Note: If you need to, you can trace the basic outline from the picture instead. Later you can practice drawing the basic outline yourself. Darken the curves of the body and head. 'Flesh' out the legs. This is also a good time to sketch in shapes for the mane and tail. make sure you don't darken the lines too much. If you do, it will be hard to fix if you make a mistake, and it will take out that 'realistic' look. Animals are soft, fleshy creatures, and don't have hard, stone carved lines. Lightly color in the horse. Don't worry about shadows, or markings. Smudging the shading helps to give the horse a soft, 'live' look. Make sure to erase the circles. It's important to remember where your 'source of light' is coming from. make sure you don't darken the 'highlights' of the horse. Also, the darkness of your shading depends on what color your horse is. If you are drawing a light colored horse, use less shading on the overall horse. If you're drawing a dark colored horse, use more. Again, smudging helps to make it more realistic. Also, be sure to use the picture as a reference! This will really help with your shading! If they are white, you may not need to shade at all. Just add soft lines to show texture. If they are very dark (Such as black) Shade it to a very dark gray. Then add black lines to show texture. If something doesn't look right, fix it! That's what erasers are for. Also, it's a good idea to add your own personal touches here and there. You don't have to copy the picture exactly. Erase any shading that got where it isn't supposed to be. Fix minor things. Add final touches to the shading. You don't have to add background if you are happy with your picture. If you are inexperienced with drawing, this may be challenging; but if you want to try, go for it! Add your signature to your drawing. If you want, you can still do a little more 'touching up'. Drawings never really have to be 'finished' if you want to continue adding on to it.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 3th, and 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3, 15]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 33 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check(15, \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Note: If you need to, you can trace the basic outline from the picture instead.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Later you can practice drawing the basic outline yourself.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"]}}}

Try to hone in on what it is that you\u2019re really worried about. This will not only help your anxieties feel less overwhelming, but will also get you closer to developing a strategy for dealing with them. For example, you may have a general fear of people judging you at work. Try to pinpoint your concerns more specifically. Are you afraid your boss doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re being productive enough? Are you worried that your coworker might be gossiping about you? Do you feel like you need more training or support at your job? Once you\u2019ve narrowed down what\u2019s bothering you, think about where that fear comes from. In some cases, you may find that your concerns are rational. It\u2019s also possible, however, that you\u2019re hung up on anxieties that you learned at some earlier point in your life. With a little reflection, you may decide those fears are unfounded.  For example, maybe you\u2019re worried that people at your job will judge you because you have tattoos. If you\u2019re in the kind of workplace where tattoos are considered inappropriate (such as a conservative law office), that might be a legitimate concern. If you have a job in an easy-going coffee shop where everyone wears body art, it\u2019s probably okay if you have tattoos. Ask yourself if your anxiety comes from some other source, such as things you heard from your parents growing up (e.g., \u201cIf you get a tattoo, nobody will trust you!\u201d). . Being mindful means being more aware of your surroundings, thoughts, and feelings at any given moment. Making an effort to be mindful can help you feel more grounded at the moment, rather than worrying about what might happen or what other people may be thinking.  If you find yourself worrying about what other people are thinking, gently steer your thoughts back to the here and now. Think about what you are doing, how you are feeling, and what you are trying to accomplish at that moment. Recognize your feelings and thoughts without judgment. Simply being more aware of what\u2019s going on in your head can help you recognize and manage your anxiety more easily. Try doing mindful meditation to help you get used to being mindful all the time. Look for mindful meditation apps or find guided meditation exercises online. A lot of anxiety about what others are thinking comes from getting hung up on what might happen. You can help relieve some of these fears by coming up with a solution or a plan of action in case the worst does come to pass.  For example, maybe you keep thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to mess up my part of this group project, and then the other students in my group will hate me.\u201d Ask yourself, \u201cWhat would I do if I did mess up? What would help me feel better? How could I prevent it from happening again?\u201d Even if the only solution you can think of is something simple, like \u201cI would apologize for messing up,\u201d that\u2019s still a start. You will feel less helpless and anxious with even a basic plan in place. One great way to take your mind off of what other people are thinking is to do something productive. Getting busy with an important task will keep you focused on what you are doing, rather than on how others are (or might be) judging you. For example, you might:  Finish a chore or project you\u2019ve been putting off. Volunteer for a cause you support. Go out of your way to do something kind for someone (e.g., help a neighbor mow their lawn). Work on a hobby or creative project you enjoy. Spend some quality time with someone you care about.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 440 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 440}, "function_call": "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5714285714285715, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727273, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"equal\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"think\", 10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"for example\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}}}

Never sign the back of the check before you arrive at the bank; instead, do it in front of the teller as you cash it for ultimate security. Some banks may require you to deposit the check to your account rather than cash it. This is more likely if the check you are trying to cash is written on an account from another bank.  If you need cash right away and already have sufficient funds in your bank account, you can deposit the check, then immediately make a withdrawal in the amount you need. If the bank on which the check is drawn refuses to pay your bank \u2014 in other words, the check \u201cbounces\u201d \u2014 your bank will reimburse itself from your bank account. Banks will also usually charge a fee for the trouble of dealing with a returned check. Modern ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) make it easy to insert and deposit paper checks to your account. Depending on your bank, the funds may be available immediately, or you may need to wait up to three days for the cash to go through. But, if you already have sufficient funds in your account, you can just withdraw the amount you need in the meantime.  Insert your debit card Type in your PIN and press Enter Select \"Deposit Check\" Insert the check into the check deposit slot Confirm the amount on the check Withdraw the money you need from the ATM. Many banks now allow you to deposit checks into your account using a smartphone. The process may vary between banks, but it usually involves downloading the bank\u2019s app and using your smartphone camera to take a photo of your check.  Make sure to follow all the directions in the app. Endorse the check, then take clear, well-lit photographs of its front and back sides. Keep the check until you receive confirmation that it has been deposited, then destroy it. Once the check clears, though, you will have to leave the house to withdraw the money you deposited from an ATM or bank branch.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 19 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1], \"change\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}}}

We like going for longer rides out in the country because we love nature and it is quiet and we don't have to worry about a large volume of vehicles moving about. We are are traveling down this older paved road kind of in the middle of nowhere and we pass something flat on the road. I didn't initially think anything of it but I decided to turn around and go see exactly what it was. I rolled up to it and leaned over and discovered it was a phone case. Okay, I thought someone had just dropped a phone case out of their car window or something and that I would just throw this case away and help clean up road litter. Well, I picked it up and actually found that there was a phone within the case. Holy crap I thought, someone had actually lost their phone in the middle of nowhere, how did that happen? So I try to turn it on and it doesn't function and nothing works. It doesn't looked damaged but it clearly has run out of battery life. I thought about just leaving it there because I thought maybe someone would come back looking for their phone but my husband suggested I pick it up and bring it home and then report it to the department or the phone company if we could get it powered up and try to have it returned.  Well, we took it home and I put it into a drawer and decided I would get back to it as soon as I could because I just didn't have any time to fiddle with it that day. A few weeks had actually went by and I had forgotten all about it. I was looking for some tape to wrap a present and I checked the drawer and noticed the phone was there. I grabbed the tape next to the phone and finished up my wrapping but I went back to the phone and decided I would plug it in to see if it would power up. I managed to get it some power but I could not get past the initial power up lock phase so I had no idea who this belonged to or where to even bring it. Well, we only have 1 at&t store in our town so I figured I would just bring it to them and see if the phone was one of theirs. Turns out, it actually was one of their phones and the customer who owned it was looking for it. I left my name and my phone number and I obviously left the phone there and I went about my day knowing I had done a good deed. Well, two days later I actually get a call from an employee at the at&t store here and they tell me that this elderly woman was incredibly grateful because she had pictures on the phone of her late husband and the fact that the phone was returned had brought tears to her eyes because her phone was the only place that had those photos. Words could not describe the joy that I had when I had found out that the phone had found its home. I find it so bizarre that I was out in the middle of nowhere and I just happened to stumble upon this phone just lying there.

Recently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been proposed by pretraining Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to an improved model capacity, they further investigate the scaling effect by increasing the parameter scale to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also exhibit some special abilities (e.g., in context learning) that are not present in small-scale language models (e.g., BERT). To discriminate the language models in different parameter scales, the research community has coined the term LLMs for the PLMs of significant size e.g., tens or even hundreds of billions of parameters. In the vast world of computer language processing, a revolutionary entity has emerged, Large Language Models (LLMs). These models possess the remarkable ability to understand intricate linguistic patterns and respond coherently matching the context. LLMs are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that serve as powerful tools for various tasks, including machine translation and question answering. One notable example of LLMs is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. Based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, it was trained on a vast corpus of internet-sourced text data, including books, articles, wikis, and websites. ChatGPT excels at generating human-like responses and engaging in conversations with users (Hadi et al., 2023). In recent years, major research institutes and technology companies have increased their investment in the development of LLMs, resulting in a series of groundbreaking models with the potential for a wide range of applications. Ope22 p e S2 ] L C . s c [ v17.02 : v i X r a             \fnAI is a pioneer in this field. The GPT family (e.g., GPT-3 and GPT-4) has made significant advances in natural language generation, dialogue systems, and text comprehension, and is widely used in a variety of intelligent assistants, content creation tools, and automated services (Torfi et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al., 2019a) and the subsequent T5 (Textto-Text Transfer Transformer) (Raffel et al., 2020) models developed by Google research department have also made significant progress in tasks such as question-answer systems, text classification and information retrieval.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)[19, 17] have been investigated by several studies with extensive analysis of their strengths and weaknesses [42, 46, 13]. Recent works [5, 48] typically adhere to a common workflow: (i) selecting models for testing, (ii) devising specialized benchmarks tailored to address specific research questions (which may entail data collection and annotation), and (iii) evaluating the models on these benchmarks, analyzing the results, and drawing conclusions. Let us examine a simple example. Consider the question: Do LMMs understand colors? Answering this question requires testing one or multiple models on color recognition tasks. To perform this experimental evaluation, various considerations can arise. How many colors should be included in the test? How complex should the color palette be? If a model shows proficiency with a specific set of colors, should we conclude the test or continue with further examination? In other words, performing such experimental validation requires the researchers to perform a great deal of manual work: designing the benchmark, testing the models, analyzing the results, and determining whether the depth of the analyses is sufficient to draw conclusions. This process is not only tedious but also complex, particularly in designing benchmarks, as it requires significant domain expertise. Additionally, data collection and curation can be notoriously expensive, and the protocol design and \u2217Currently at Apple. Correspondence to:  Preprint. Under review.             \fresult analyses can be bound to subjectivity. These considerations lead us to investigate a framework capable of autonomously designing and executing a wide range of experiments aimed at evaluating the capabilities of existing LMMs. In this paper, we propose to address this question following the principles of programming visual tools via Large Language Models (LLMs) [41]. Our framework, named AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING OF EXPERIMENTS (APEX), redacts a scientific report to answer any user-specified inquiry by first instantiating a structured empty report and then iteratively improving it through a series of experiments. Specifically, an LLM processes the user request and: (i) generates a suitable benchmark via image retrieval, generation, or augmentation; (ii) deploys models to test; (iii) conducts the experiment; (iv) collects and analyzes the results. The findings are incorporated into the report, which is then fed back to the LLM to determine whether the information is sufficient to answer the initial inquiry. If not, APEX creates a new benchmark and runs more experiments. This iterative process continues until the LLM judges the report comprehensive enough to address the user\u2019s question. We evaluate APEX with a wide range of queries to demonstrate its flexibility in designing benchmarks and automatically conducting experiments, reaching conclusions that are valid and insightful. To demonstrate that APEX actually produces reliable reports, we show that it can successfully lead to the core findings of existing manually engineered benchmark studies [42]. Moreover, APEX can flexibly handle queries of various granularity, allowing users to thoroughly explore the strengths and weaknesses of existing LMMs. Finally, the modularity of APEX enables easy inclusion of new tools and capabilities in the future, widening its application scope. To summarize, this work makes the following contributions: \u2022 We introduce APEX, the first automated benchmark framework to test various capabilities of LMMs at user request; \u2022 APEX automates benchmark design, experiments execution, and results analysis. Its modular design makes it extensible to incorporate other tools and functionalities; \u2022 We show that APEX outputs valid and comprehensive reports, being able to reproduce findings of previous studies. \u2022 APEX facilitates the discovery of novel strengths and weaknesses of existing LMMs by addressing arbitrary queries at different granularity.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 540 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 540}, "function_call": "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 29 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}}}

After being in a relationship for years, I decided to propose and make her my wife. I thought it was going to be a happily ever after story; married young, have wonderful kids, house with a picket fence, be together until we're old as dirt. Everything was going right in my life. I felt like I was on top of the world. However, as time started to past, we started drifting apart and we started to truly dislike each other. Couldn't believe it, but we were no longer in love with each other. She claimed I wasn't home enough for her and the kids, I wasn't making enough money, and my \"sex game\" was poor. On top of that, I found flirty text messages of her communicating with some guy I never met.  We ended up getting a divorce, but the divorce ended up being the worst thing I ever went through. Since I filed for the divorce, she made sure to make my world a living hell. I was at work, struggling to pay attention due to my stock positions being incredibly down in a long time, and this guy comes to my desk with a smile on his face. He served me papers, from my ex, that stated that she wanted full custody of the kids. I couldn't believe this woman. Since then, I started to fall into a depression. I haven't seen my kids in days, my job's numbers are poor, I needed a lawyer for the lawsuit, but I couldn't afford one at the time. My job just wasn't cutting it, due to the extraordinary bills I had. I needed to find another job as soon as possible, but time wasn't trying to be on my side. Nobody was giving me a chance, I was too overqualified. Suddenly, I was given an opportunity that came out of nowhere; one of my bosses quit. I was next in line for that position, which means instant promotion, instant bonus and instant opportunities. I was finally able to deal with this lawsuit. In the end, I won the lawsuit; we share custody, and she pays for my lawyer fees as well as hers. I never wanted it to be this way, but this lawsuit showed me that life is real and anything can knock you off your tracks easily.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 3 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 3}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 360, "min_cnt": 340}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.16666666666666666, "sft": 0.4615384615384615, "simpo": 0.22222222222222224, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"]}}}

It is easy to trust those around us, such as family and close friends.  Recently, my grandfather had a stroke.  He lost some of his motor skills and memory.  It may have changed him, but he was still a precious man.  He and my grandmother have been married over fifty years, and it would seem that there would be love and empathy, but there was none from her.  She had zero admiration, only hate for her husband.  She has claimed that there have been some significant events surrounding my grandfather, such as him urinating in the closet, running away, and chasing her throughout the house beating her.  My grandmother voiced her hatred for my grandfather stating that he had cashed a life insurance policy out during the 1980's for $5000, and she would never forgive him for that.  She simply could not let go of that, and her two daughters followed suit with their hatred toward my grandfather.  He had given all of them everything he could financially and from his heart.  His efforts were in vain because of the lies my grandmother told, she was able to commit my grandfather to a psychiatric ward.  It is a mental institution for the criminally insane, and he is a veteran.  He is unable to stand up for himself, and my family made him property of the state.  My grandmother also made arrangements that when he dies, the local university can have his body for science.  She has dared the family to have a funeral or memorial service.  A week ago, my mother called and said that she heard from my grandmother that my grandfather clinically died, but was revived.  He is all alone in a strange place, and he is very sick.  I am devastated.  The whole situation has made me consider how someone can make up lies about you, and there can be legal ramifications.  The very people that you firmly believe love you are the very people that are distrustful.  It has also opened my eyes to how important an advanced directive and a will are in order to protect people if they are ever incapacitated from evil people in their lives.

So that no one person feels burdened by always having to provide the snacks, task the group leaders of each session to bring food and drink.  Opt for finger foods with a lot of protein and not a lot of grease. Choose things like fruits, veggies, nuts, cheese, hummus, or pretzels. Pizza works in a pinch for a late-night study sessions, but remember it's greasy and probably going to make you feel full and tired after eating it, instead of alert and focused. The group leaders should be tasked with making and distributing a plan for each study session. It can be as detailed as the leader needs it to be to keep everyone on track. What is important is that everyone in the group has a rough outline for exactly what will be covered and in what order. This will help keep everyone on task because they will know what they need to cover.  The agenda should begin with the hardest material to get that out of the way while everyone's brain is still alert and awake. The structure should be determined by the group leaders and whatever they think makes the most sense for covering the topics of the day. Structure largely depends on the class. For a math class, you might spend \u2154 on homework problems and \u2153 on concepts, but for a history class, you'd probably spend most of your time discussing main ideas. If your study session is any longer than 45 minutes, you definitely want to schedule in breaks for stretching, using the restroom, checking your phone, or just chatting. Giving intermittent breaks keeps everyone on task when they should be working because they know there is a time coming when they can step away. The break schedule should be included in the agenda for the day. Decide together as a group what you think works best. Some people like to work for 25 minutes and then take a break for 5 minutes. Others prefer to work longer sessions and take longer breaks. It doesn't really matter as long as everyone agrees. Encourage your group leaders to be creative with how they conduct the studying time. There are many websites available with ideas for effective studying strategies. Try them out and see what works best for your group.  People learn differently. Some are visual learners, some learning by writing, and some learn best by teaching others. Since your group will be made up of diverse individuals, be willing to try out different methods so that everyone can benefit. Some proven study methods are teaching each other the materials, having debates, watching and discussing film clips, playing trivia games, and quizzing one another. Take at least 10 minutes at the end of each study session to go over the main ideas again. Also, leave time for anyone in the group to ask questions on any material they still don't understand. Even if you think you know the material well, you will benefit from hearing it again or answering questions of your group members.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 4 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 4}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 22 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.16666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.4, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"greasy\", 2, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"burdened\", 1, \"equal\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"alert\", 3, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"focused\", 4, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"tired\", 1, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": [], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"]}}}

You may have a tendency to skip breakfast, only eating 2 main meals, but making sure you actually eat three meals can help you gain weight. If you can't eat huge meals because it upsets your stomach, eat smaller meals throughout the day. Don't skip meals. Eating often throughout your day can provide you a steady flow of calories. Try to eat at least every 4 hours, whether it is one of your meals or a small snack. If you're not up to a meal, have a snack that includes protein and three different types of food. If you prefer, you can create 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day, rather than adding snacks between larger meals. For instance, try a piece of whole grain bread with banana and peanut butter or some celery with hummus and feta cheese. Prepare snacks ahead of time that are easy to grab and eat. If you have them on hand, you're more likely to eat when you should.  For instance, you can mix dried fruit, chocolate chips (dark is best), rolled oats, and a nut butter. Make them into golf-ball size portions, and store them wrapped individually in parchment paper or wax paper.  For quick snacks, keep trail mixes on hand, as the mix of nuts and dried fruit is calorie-dense. Sometimes, eating all day long can fill you up, and you don't get enough calories to gain weight. However, if you get some of your calories in liquid form, you won't feel as full. You want to skip sodas, which don't offer much nutrition. Instead, drink smoothies, liquid yogurt, and even fruit juice, all of which have calories and nutrients. Drinking water or any beverage before eating can fill you up. You want to leave room for the calories you need to consume. Instead of drinking water before you eat, try drinking a calorie-rich drink while eating, such as fruit juice or a smoothie. While chips and cookies look like an easy way to put on weight, you want to put on weight healthily. Eating these empty calories isn't healthy. Keep your foods rich in nutrients, such as vegetables, fruits, and meat, as you increase your calories. Avoid foods such as sodas and overly sugary foods. One reason you want to skip these calories is they won't help you build muscle or bone, which help support your added weight. Lifting and weight training help your body gain muscle weight, which is the best kind of weight for your body to put on. Start off slowly if you aren't used to doing this kind of training. Increase weight and decrease reps as you go along  In addition, exercise increases your appetite, making you want to eat more.  A simple exercise to start with is bicep curls. Hold a weight in each hand. Your arms should be bent at the elbows so the weights are out in front of you. Lift the arms together to your shoulders, then slowly bring them back down. Repeat 6 to 8 times. Rest, and do it again.  You can also try exercises such as swimming, biking, or doing push-ups.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 28 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 16th, and 23th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [16, 23]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.7692307692307693, "sft": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333333, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"16th sentence content\", \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"23rd sentence content\", \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16, 23], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 22], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"]}}}

We went for a trip to the beautiful hill station last month. It was a nice family trip where we enjoyed a lot. The trip started on a breezy Sunday morning. We hired a van from our home and my uncle\u2019s family accompanied us. We boarded a lodge at 10 \u2018o clock in the morning and the weather so cold that we were freezing like a statue. After getting ready with all our jackets over us we went to the Thunder world which was a very different theme zone I have ever seen. \u00a0The botanical garden and rose garden were so amazing. It was a great scene to see so many flowers all together. They all looked as if they were smiling at us. The next day we visited Pykara and the boating experience there, was indeed not equivalent to words. The same afternoon we went to Mudhumalai forests and saw wildlife face to face. The trip was so wonderful that it cannot be explained simply in words. The trip to Ooty was definitely one of the most memorable ones in my life. Today my tenth board exam results have been declared. Until 2'o clock, my heart was beating very fast. As soon as I saw my result I felt that I was on the top of this world. I have come first in my school. Everyone was very happy after they came to know my results. My parents were so happy that they ordered lots of sweets and distributed in our neighborhood. I was at the top of the world after I came to know that I was the topper of my school. I will always remember this day as it was one of the best days of my life.  I was away on a long weekend with a group of my best friends, sitting around, drinking and having fun when something struck me. I wondered how this had happened? \u200bThe most healthy person in the room had recently completed an Iron\u200b \u200bMan triathlon, so I had a pretty high benchmark to \u200bmeet.

Several NLP tasks have achieved signi\ufb01cant progress utilizing these pre-trained models reaching previously unattainable performance (Clark et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019b). The size of these models have been also steadily growing to hundreds of millions (Devlin et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019) to billions of parameters (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Code available at: Task-agnostic checkpoints available at: The huge size poses signi\ufb01cant challenges for downstream applications in terms of energy consumption and cost of inference (Strubell et al., 2019). As such, it could be a deterrent to using them in practice limiting their usage in onthe edge scenarios and under constrained computational training or inference budgets. Several research directions have considered compressing large-scale models including work on pruning (Gordon et al., 2020), quantization (Han et al., 2016) and distillation (Sanh, 2019). Knowledge distillation, in particular, has shown strong results in pre-trained transformerbased language model compression. With knowledge distillation, we train a student network (with smaller capacity) to mimic the full output distribution of the teacher network (Hinton et al., 2015). Knowledge distillation has been applied to pretrained language model compression in two different settings: (1) before task-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ne tuning (i.e. task-agnostic distillation) or (2) after taskspeci\ufb01c \ufb01ne tuning (i.e. task-speci\ufb01c distillation). Task-agnostic distillation (Sanh, 2019; Sun et al., 2019, 2020) has the advantage that the model needs to be distilled only once and can be reused for \ufb01ne-tuning on multiple down-stream tasks. It also allows us to achieve speedup in both \ufb01ne-tuning and inference. On the other hand, taskspeci\ufb01c distillation (Tang et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2019; Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020) has been shown to achieve signi\ufb01cantly higher compression rate and inference speedup (Fu et al., 2020; Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020). In this work, we \ufb01rst study the transferability of pre-trained models across several source tasks to select the optimal one for transfer. We then aim to create universally distilled models that can be used with any downstream task while leveraging the bene\ufb01ts of the techniques and augmentation resources developed for the source transfer task. We             \fand augmentation resources show that distilled models that use task-speci\ufb01c data transfer to varying degrees and their transferability depends on choices of the source task, data augmentation strategy and distillation techniques. Contributions: More speci\ufb01cally, this work makes the following contributions: (a) Studies the transferability of several source tasks taskagnostic knowledge distillation. (b) Develops a distillation framework to learn a massively compressed student model leveraging deep hidden representations and attention states from multiple layers of the teacher model with progressive knowledge transfer. (c) Extensive experiments on several datasets in GLUE benchmark and for massive multilingual NER demonstrate the effectiveness of task and language transfer. Finally, we will release the taskagnostic checkpoints for the distilled models. for", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 3th, and 4th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3, 4]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 500 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 500}, "function_call": "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(500, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(11, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 4], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

Despite the excellent performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on a large number of NLP tasks, their performance is often affected when applied to domain-speci\ufb01c texts that exhibit signi\ufb01cant differences from general text in terms of word usage, syntax, and writing style (Gururangan et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021). To address this issue, Gururangan et al. (2020) proposed that continuing to pre-train a general PLM on target domain corpora and task-relevant texts can effectively improve its performance on \u2217Corresponding author. domain-speci\ufb01c tasks, while Gu et al. (2021) further suggested that pre-training domain-speci\ufb01c PLMs from scratch with a suf\ufb01ciently large corpus can achieve even better domain-speci\ufb01c performance. Inspired by these studies, domain-speci\ufb01c pre-trained language models have emerged in some domains, such as BioBERT (Peng et al., 2019a) and PubMedBERT (Gu et al., 2021) in the biomedicine \ufb01eld, which have been utilized for practical tasks like entity and relation extraction. We collect all existing NLP competition tasks and academic datasets related to \ufb01nance on the Chinese internet and summarized them in Table 2, revealing a growing demand for NLP capabilities in \ufb01nance, particularly in information extraction and sentiment analysis. To meet these demands and improve the overall level of Chinese \ufb01nancial NLP, several companies have already developed and released Chinese \ufb01nancial pre-trained language models, such as FinBERT (Hou et al., 2020) and Mengzi-BERT-base-\ufb01n (Zhang et al., 2021). However, these models are based on the BERT-base model, have a single architecture type, and a parameter count (around 110 million) that is outdated and unable to meet the increasing demand for NLP capabilities in this \ufb01eld. Therefore, we propose FinT5, the largest Chinese \ufb01nancial pre-trained language model to date, based on the advanced T5 architecture, with 220 million parameters for the base version and 1 billion for the large version. Furthermore, NLP tasks in the \ufb01nancial industry focus primarily on information extraction, requiring models with high entity knowledge understanding and memorization capabilities. Although studies have shown that pre-trained PLMs on largescale corpora already have some entity knowledge understanding and memorization capabilities, there are still some shortcomings. To address this issue, many studies have used knowledge-enhanced pretraining methods to improve PLMs\u2019 understanding and memorization of entity knowledge. However, 22 b e F2 ] L C . s c [ v39.02 : v i X r a             \fthese methods mostly target BERT-like models and lack strategies designed for T5 models. To improve T5\u2019s performance on \ufb01nancial NLP tasks, we propose a concise knowledge-enhanced pretraining method based on the T5 model\u2019s text-totext paradigm. In addition, another challenge faced by Chinese \ufb01nancial NLP is the lack of corpus. The scale and diversity of corpora play an essential role in language model pre-training (Xu et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020). However, existing Chinese \ufb01nancial corpora are small in scale, poor in diversity and not open, as can be shown in Table 1. To solve this problem, we \ufb01rst need to determine the text types that a quali\ufb01ed Chinese \ufb01nancial corpus needs to cover. To this end, we \ufb01rst collected almost all existing Chinese \ufb01nancial NLP tasks and summarized their text sources, as shown in the Table 2. According to the source distribution of these tasks, we have determined the range of text types we need to collect. As a result, we collect and release a large-scale Chinese \ufb01nancial corpus named BBT-FinCorpus with about 300 GB raw text, which consists of \ufb01ve different sources to enhance its diversity covering most text sources of Chinese \ufb01nancial NLP tasks. The widespread use of benchmark evaluations is a key driving force that has greatly improved and rapidly iterated PLMs. These evaluations use a single score to assess model performance across multiple tasks, enabling direct and comprehensive comparisons between pre-trained language models. Existing English PLMs use the general benchmark evaluations GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), while the general benchmark evaluation for Chinese PLMs is CLUE (Xu et al., 2020). Almost all PLMs participate in these evaluations to compare their performance with other models. However, there is no publicly available benchmark for Chinese \ufb01nancial NLP, which makes it dif\ufb01cult to compare existing pre-trained language models on different task sets and hinders the rapid improvement of PLM performance in the Chinese \ufb01nancial domain. To address this issue and promote research in the \ufb01nancial domain, we propose CFLEB, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding and Generation Evaluation Benchmark, consisting of six datasets covering language understanding and generation tasks. These datasets encompass a diverse range of text genres, dataset sizes, and levels of dif\ufb01culty, and more importantly, emphasize challenges that arise in real-world scenarios.

This problem is particularly acute in developing countries due to varying literacy levels, high cost of phone ownership, etc. (Ranjan, 2022). Many of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) are documented on support sites2 with step-by-step instructions describing what the user should do on the UI. We explore the problem of harnessing such help documents to create step-by-step tutorials overlaid on the UI of the phone. To create step-by-step tutorials on the UI using help documents, several natural language processing components including retrieval, parsing, and grounding are required. But no relevant dataset exists for this task in the multilingual setting. We build on prior work in the NLP community in this area (Li et al., 2020a) and extend it along the multilingual and multimodal directions. We collect a new multi-lingual, multi-modal UI grounded dataset called UGIF-DataSet to evaluate how well we can create step-by-step tutorials on the Android UI. It consists of 523 how-to queries per language and for each query, step-by-step instructions in English and a sequence of UI screenshots and actions that show how to complete the task. Each how-to query and UI sequence is available in 8 languages. An outline of the structure of this dataset is shown in Fig. 2. The data we release is focused on retrieval, parsing, and instruction following in Android, which should be of interest to the NLP community. The central language related challenge here arises from the fact that many smartphone users are bilingual or even multilingual and frequently use non-EN languages. They ask queries in their native language, but the help documents are often available only in the English. Hence the need for cross-modal, cross-lingual retrieval. Furthermore, users may use a different UI / System language, and app developers do not always provide translations for every UI element resulting in some UI elements in English and the rest in the chosen system language. This necessitates cross-lingual UI 1pronounced with a soft-g: U-JIF             \fFigure 1: Our proposed initial approach retrieves the relevant help document, parses it to generates macros such as tap(), toggle(), home(), etc., and grounds each macro in the UI (Section 1). grounding to map the instruction steps in English to UI screens containing different languages. We propose an initial approach to this task that splits it into retrieval, parsing, and grounding. When the user utters a query, the matching FAQ page is retrieved from the support site using an off-the-shelf speech recognizer and a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) to find the closest matching how-to question in the help document corpus. The step-by-step instructions in the help document are parsed using a large language model (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to generate macros such as tap(), toggle(), home(), etc. This macro sequence is used to create a tutorial on-device by grounding each macro in the UI using a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) to find the closest matching UI element. The contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 We release UGIF-DataSet, a new multilingual, multi-modal dataset of how-to queries and sequences of UI screens and actions performed by human annotators. This is the first such multi-modal dataset of its kind. \u2022 We evaluate parsing of step-by-step how-to instructions with large language models and UI grounding with multi-lingual BERT sentence embedding (LaBSE). \u2022 Our results indicate that there is considerable room to improve performance, especially in non-English languages.

Similar to other multimodal tasks (e.g., visual question answering (Antol et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2016), image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015; Jia et al., * First two  (cid:66) Corresponding author. Figure 1: Comparison of MMT and Multilingual MMT. (a) For MMT, we need to train different MMT models to support translations between different language pairs (e.g., \u201cEn-De\u201d represents to translate the English to German). (b). For Multilingual MMT, we only need one single model to translate the source language to different target languages. 2015) and video-text retrieval (Liu et al., 2022d)), MMT aims to exploit the effectiveness of vision information for the machine translation task. Moreover, MMT has broad applications (Zhou et al., 2018), such as multimedia news and movie subtitles in different languages. However, as shown in Fig. 1(a), previous MMT models (e.g., DCCN (Lin et al., 2020)) can handle a single language translation pair (e.g., English \u2192 German, English \u2192 French) well, but training a separate model for each language pair is unaffordable considering there are thousands of languages in the world. A straightforward solution to reduce computational cost is to use one model for handling the translations of multiple languages as shown in Fig. 1(b). Meanwhile, multilingual machine translation has been investigated for many years (Conneau et al., 2020), but these existing methods only consider the language as the input, where the vision context has been ignored.

To eliminate the above limitations, we propose a simple and effective LVP-M3 method, including Token Encoding, Language-aware Visual Prompt Generation (LVPG), and Language Translation. Speci\ufb01cally, in the token encoding stage, we use the pre-trained vision encoder to extract the visual tokens. Then, we follow (Johnson et al., 2017) to utilize the Transformer to encode the textual tokens. In LVPG, inspired by (Yang et al., 2019) and (Tian et al., 2020), a controller network in Fig. 3 is leveraged to dynamically generate the parameters of the mapping network conditioned on the target language. Further, the mapping network outputs the language-aware visual prompts. After that, during the language translation, following the works (e.g., ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019)), we utilize coTransformer to generate the vision-guided language tokens. Then the Transformer decoder is adopted to predict the translation results. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed benchmark datasets for LVP-M3. Results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all translation directions, especially outperforming the text-only multilingual model by 4.3 BLEU scores on average.

These models, trained on extensive amounts of data, exhibit increased accuracy and emergent abilities as their parameter count grows from millions to billions [52]. LLMs designed for coding are also trained on vast amounts of data and can effectively learn the structure and syntax of programming languages. As a result, they are highly adept at tasks like generating [21], summarising [1], and completing code [30]. Large language models also exhibit emergent capabilities [50]. These abilities cannot be predicted by extrapolating scaling laws and only emerge at a certain critical model size threshold [50]. This makes it appealing to train ever-larger models, as capabilities such as chain-of-thought prompting [51] and instruction tuning [42] only become feasible in models with more than 100B parameters [50]. Many have noted that large language models trained on natural language are capable of memorising extensive amounts of training data [2, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 23, 29, 32, 37, 46, 48]. The issue of memorisation in source code is distinct from that of natural language. Source code is governed by different licences that reflect different values than natural language [16, 23]. Hence, in addition to privacy considerations, the memorisation of source code can have legal ramifications. The open-source code used in LLM training for code is frequently licenced under nonpermissive copy-left licences, such as GPL or the CC-BY-SA licence employed by StackOverflow [2].1 Reusing code covered by these licences without making the source code available under the same licence is considered a violation of copyright law. In some jurisdictions, this leaves users of tools such as CoPilot at legal risk [2, 16, 23]. Licences are unavoidably linked to the source code, as they enforce the developers\u2019 commitment to sharing, transparency, and openness [2, 16]. Sharing code without proper licences is also ethically questionable [2, 23, 46]. Memorised data can also include private information [10, 13, 28]. These privacy concerns extend to code, which can contain credentials, API keys, emails, and other sensitive information as well [2, 4]. Memorisation could therefore put the private information contained in the training data at risk. Recently, attacks which leverage memorisation have successfully extracted (or reconstructed) training data from LLMs [3, 5, 13, 29]. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) considers data reconstruction attacks to be the most concerning type of privacy attack against machine learning models [41]. OWASP 1StackOverflow Licence:              \fICSE \u201924, April 14\u201320, 2024, Lisbon, Portugal Ali Al-Kaswan, Maliheh Izadi, and Arie van Deursen classifies Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06) as the sixth most critical vulnerability in LLM applications. 2 Larger models are more likely to memorise more data and are more vulnerable to data extraction [5, 13, 29, 41]. The effort to create ever larger LLMs, therefore, creates models which carry more risk. To our knowledge, previous studies have investigated data memorisation and extraction attacks in natural language, but there has been no empirical investigation of LLMs for code. In this work, we investigate to which extent large language models for code memorise their training data and how this compares to memorisation in large language models trained on natural language. There is no comprehensive framework or approach for measuring memorisation. We start by defining a data extraction security game that is grounded in the theory behind membership inference attacks and the notion of k-extractability. Using this security game we define a framework to quantify memorisation in LLMs. We use data extraction as an estimator of memorisation. While memorisation of training data can manifest in the form of non-exact duplication, measuring the rate of data extraction data extraction provides a lower bound of memorisation in a model. We perform experiments leveraging the SATML training data extraction challenge, an existing dataset for natural language.3 We extend this benchmark by testing memorisation on more models. We construct a similar dataset for code, by mining data from the Google BigQuery GitHub dataset and by using a CodeGen code generation model [39]. Similarly to the natural language dataset, we first identify samples vulnerable to attack to build a benchmark. We then tested a variety of models on this benchmark. We finally compare the rate of memorisation between text and code models. Our key result: Large language models trained on code memorise their training data like their natural language counterparts and are vulnerable to attack. To summarise, the main contributions of this paper are: \u2022 A novel approach, using a data extraction security game, to quantify memorisation rates of code or natural language models \u2022 A benchmark of key memorisation characteristics for 10 different models of different sizes \u2022 An empirical assessment of memorisation in code models demonstrating that (1) code models memorise training data, albeit at a lower rate than natural language models; (2) larger models, with more parameters, exhibit more memorisation; (3) data carriers (such as dictionaries) are memorised at a higher rate than, e.g., regular code, documentation, or tests; (4) different model architectures memorise different samples. \u2022 We make the code to run the evaluation available to allow others to replicate our results and to evaluate other models. 4 2OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications:  project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ 3Language Models Training Data Extraction Challenge:  research/lm-extraction-benchmark 4GitHub repo:", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 38 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 38}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 5th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 5]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666665, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to their exceptional accuracy in performing a broad spectrum of NLP tasks [36].\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"These models, trained on extensive amounts of data, exhibit increased accuracy and emergent abilities as their parameter count grows from millions to billions [52].\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to their exceptional accuracy in performing a broad spectrum of NLP tasks [36].\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"As a result, they are highly adept at tasks like generating [21], summarising [1], and completing code [30].\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"few years.\", 1, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

Additionally, keep the output to fewer than 27 sentences:\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed, take a few seconds to get in a comfortable position and take a deep breath through your nose for 4 counts. Hold your breath in for 7 counts before exhaling through your mouth slowly for a full 8 counts. Keep breathing like this 3\u20135 times and notice how your body feels more at ease when you\u2019re finished. You can also try belly breathing as well. Put your left hand on your belly and slowly inhale through your nose. As you breathe, keep your chest still and let your stomach push out. Exhale through your mouth and push your belly to force the air out. Keep your mouth closed so your teeth are slightly apart. Sit up straight and hum to make an \u201cmmm\u201d sound in the back of your throat. Breathe through your nose and continue to hum until you start feeling the vibrations throughout your face and in your chest so you feel relaxed. Vocal toning exercises the muscles in your ear so you can detect higher frequencies of human speech and determine what they truly mean to say. Laughter can be the best medicine when you\u2019re feeling stressed since it immediately relieves the tension you\u2019re feeling. If you have time, turn on a short and funny video on YouTube, listen to your favorite comedian, or picture a funny image in your head.   You can also try to make light of the situation by making up ridiculous what-if scenarios that aren\u2019t likely to happen. For example, if you\u2019re stressed about a job interview, you may make yourself laugh by asking, \u201cWhat if the interviewer and I are wearing the exact same thing?\u201d or, \u201cWhat would I do if the interviewer was a mime?\u201d Close your eyes and imagine resting far away on a desert island, walking in a field of flowers, or going somewhere else that makes you feel calm. Think about what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste there so you can picture yourself there better and distract yourself from how you\u2019re feeling right now. When you feel more relaxed, open your eyes and notice how your body feels.  Even picturing something like eating a comforting meal can help you feel at ease. Try to remember a memory where you felt relaxed or excited to boost your mood even more. Keeping your mind on what you need to do rather than your stress will help pass time more quickly so you\u2019re not stressing about it as long. Start with the most complicated tasks first so you get them out of the way before working on the easier things. Do the best that you can so you know that you put your best foot forward.  For example, if you are taking an exam, take your time. Carefully comprehend each question and focus on what you already have studied and memorized. If in a play, focus on the lines you have memorized.  Watch and listen carefully for your cue. Get into your role and pretend you really are that character. Everyone responds to stress differently. If you get agitated or angry when you\u2019re stressed, take some time to relax first. If you normally get spaced out or withdrawn, try to fight stress with a stimulating and energizing activity instead.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 15th, and 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15, 19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.7272727272727273, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.75}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"15th sentence.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"19th sentence.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 19], \"unchange\")"]}}}

This will help you predict any hiccups you might experience in starting your business, such as figuring out how to secure funding or what area of town is the best location for your business.  Traditionally, business plans are broken down into some combination of these 9 nine sections: executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management, service or product line, marketing, funding, financial projections, and appendix. Be as detailed in your plan as possible. Make a list of the smaller details about your business, such as owner\u2019s and employees\u2019 responsibilities, the types of services you\u2019ll provide, and what prices you intend to offer your products at. To maximize your chances of success, you\u2019ll need to determine what you can offer in your aquarium shop that customers in your area can\u2019t get from your competitors. Visit other aquarium shops to see what products and services they sell, what prices they offer, and other relevant aspects of their businesses. Another good way to do this type of research is to learn what leading aquarium shops are doing, then figure out how you could do it better. For example, if a major aquarium shop offers free next-day installation, see if your store can offer free same-day installation. Check with your state and local governments to learn what types of licenses and certificates your business will be required to have. Because you\u2019ll be working with animals, your shop will also be subject to any animal welfare laws that exist where you\u2019re located.  For example, if your aquarium shop is located in the United States, it is required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act. If you\u2019re unsure what licenses, certificates, or insurance you\u2019ll need, you may want to hire a business attorney who can help guide you through these legal questions. Ideally, try to hire one with experience working with pet stores. It may seem counterintuitive, but you\u2019ll want to look for an available storefront as close to your biggest competitor as possible, in order to take advantage of the foot traffic that their store generates. Plus, if they\u2019re successful, it\u2019s probably due in part to their location, which means placing your store in the same location should also help your shop.  You may not want to be directly next to your competitor, since customers may consistently choose your competitor\u2019s store over yours. However, you should aim to be in the same shopping center or area of town, if you can. If you\u2019re planning to only sell materials online, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about where your store or warehouse is located. This may include cash registers, store cleaning supplies, or even light bulbs. You can acquire most of these items from a small business wholesaler in your area. You might also be able to buy some of these items, such as cleaning supplies, online or from a mass retailer.

Such models are pretrained on tasks such as masked language modelling (MLM) and next-sentence prediction (NSP) and are intended to be task-agnostic, facilitating their transfer to new tasks following \ufb01ne-tuning with limited amounts of data. Extending such models to multiple languages is a natural next step, as evidenced by the recent proliferation of multilingual transformers, including multilingual BERT (mBERT), XLM (Conneau and Lample, 2019), and XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020a). These follow from a line of earlier work which sought to achieve transferable multilingual representations using recurrent networkbased methods (e.g. Artetxe et al., 2019, inter alia), as well as work on developing multilingual embedding representations (Ruder et al., 2017). it has been suggested that The considerable capacity of these multilingual models and their success in cross-lingual tasks has motivated a lot of research into the nature of the representations learned during pretraining. On the one hand, there is a signi\ufb01cant amount of research suggesting that models such as mBERT acquire robust language-speci\ufb01c representations (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Libovick\u00b4y et al., 2020; Choenni and Shutova, 2020). On in the other hand, addition to language-speci\ufb01c information, models like mBERT also have language-neutral representations, which cut across linguistic distinctions and enable the model to handle aspects of meaning language-independently. This also allows the model to be \ufb01ne-tuned on a monolingual labelled data set and achieve good results in other languages, a process known as cross-lingual zero-shot learning (Pires et al., 2019; Libovick\u00b4y et al., 2020; Conneau et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020). These results have motivated researchers to try and disentangle the language-speci\ufb01c and languageneutral components of mBERT (e.g. Libovick\u00b4y et al., 2020; Gonen et al., 2020). This background provides the motivation for the work presented in this paper. We focus on the relationship between language-speci\ufb01c and languageneutral representations in mBERT. However, our main goal is to study the impact of \ufb01ne-tuning on the balance between these two types of representations. More speci\ufb01cally, we measure the 22 c e D2 ] L C . s c [ v36.02 : v i X r a             \fshow that effect of \ufb01ne-tuning on mBERT\u2019s representations in the context of two different tasks \u2013 part-ofspeech (POS) tagging and natural language inference (NLI) \u2013 which lay different demands on the model\u2019s semantic and language-speci\ufb01c knowledge. While NLI involves reasoning about deep semantic relations between texts, POS tagging requires a model to bring to bear knowledge of a language\u2019s morphosyntactic features. Though many languages share such features as a result of typological relations (which mBERT is known to exploit; see, e.g. Pires et al., 2019; Choenni and Shutova, 2020; Rama et al., 2020), there are also language-speci\ufb01c features to which, we hypothesise, mBERT needs to dedicate a greater share of its representational capacity, compared to the NLI task. We accommodates language-speci\ufb01c and language-neutral representations to different degrees as a function of the task it is \ufb01ne-tuned on. This is supported by results from language identi\ufb01cation (LID) experiments, conducted both on task-speci\ufb01c data and on a new data set extracted from Wikipedia. We then consider two alternative strategies that force the model to \u2018unlearn\u2019 language-speci\ufb01c representations, via gradient reversal or iterative adversarial learning. These are shown not to further improve the language-independent component for cross-lingual transfer, over and above the effect of \ufb01ne-tuning. Thus, we conclude that the reorganisation of mBERT\u2019s representations that happens with \ufb01ne-tuning is already taking on this role. Note that our goal is not to improve mBERT\u2019s multilinguality but to acquire a better understanding of it, extending previous work along these lines. the model Our main contributions are (a) to provide further support for the distinction between languagespeci\ufb01c and language-neutral representation in mBERT; (b) to show that \ufb01ne-tuning results in a reorganisation of mBERT\u2019s representations in a way that destroys existing language clusters; (c) to study two methods to enhance language-neutrality in mBERT, both of which are shown not to improve performance on \ufb01ne-tuned tasks; (d) a new Wikipedia-based language identi\ufb01cation data set.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(660, \"less than\"); word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 660 tokens and more than 640 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 660, "min_cnt": 640}, "function_call": "word_count_check(660, \"less than\"); word_count_check(640, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 56 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 56}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.33333333333333337, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_full_length": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(660, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(56, \"less than\")"]}}}

These medications can also help reduce your child\u2019s fever and can make him or her feel better.  Never give children under the age of 18 aspirin as this has been linked to Reye's syndrome, which can result in brain damage and liver problems.  Use child-strength formulations when giving any pain reliever to children. Follow the dosing recommendations on the package or ask your pediatrician. Do not give ibuprofen to children under the age of 6 months. A warm compress will help lessen the pain of an ear infection. You can use a warm, damp washcloth.  You can also fill a clean tube sock with rice or beans and tie or sew the open end of the sock shut. Microwave the sock for 30 seconds at a time until it is the desired temperature. Apply the compress to the ear.  You can also use salt as a natural remedy. Heat one cup of salt and place it in a cloth. Tie it up with a rubber band and place it on the affected ear for 5-10 minutes when it\u2019s bearably hot while lying down. Apply the warm compress for 15-20 minutes at a time. Your body needs rest to recover from infections. Make sure that you do not push yourself too hard while you have an ear infection, particularly if you also have a fever. Pediatricians do not recommend that you keep a child home from school for an ear infection unless s/he has a fever. However, you should probably monitor your child\u2019s activity to make sure s/he gets the rest s/he needs. Particularly if a fever is present, you should drink extra fluids. The Institute of Medicine recommends that you drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily if you are male, and at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily if you are female. The Valsalva's Maneuver can be used to open up the eustachian tubes and relieve the \"stuffed up\" feeling that may occur with an ear infection. You should only do this maneuver if you do not currently have ear pain.  Take a deep breath and close your mouth. Pinch your nose shut. Then, while pinching the nose, \"blow\" your nose gently. Do not blow too hard, or you could damage your eardrum. You should feel your ears \"pop.\" Mullein and garlic are natural antibiotics and may also provide soothing relief from ear infection pain. If garlic oil is not available, you can prepare it at home. All you need is, cook 2 garlic cloves in 2 tablespoons (29.6\u00a0ml) of mustard or sesame oil until it turns blackish.

The text  classification  task  are  in  relevance  with  several  domains  such  as  intention  classification,  topic  classification,  sen-  timent analysis, etc. (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong,  2019;  Risch  and  Krestel,  2019;  Li  et  al.,  2020;  Heo  et al., 2021). Since the advent of pre-trained language  models (PLMs) such as Bidirectional encoder represen-  tations from transformers (BERT), Transformer-based  deep learning models have exhibited excellent perfor-  mance for text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et  al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen  et al., 2020).  However,  Transforemer-based  deep  learning  models  may yield underfitting because the size of the model can  be too extensive compared to the size of the training data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019).  In  this  regard,  some  studies  have  reported that the performance can be improved in vari-  ous tasks by artificially increasing the size of the data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019;  Brown  et  al.,  2020).  In  data-driven  machine learning, collecting sufficient amount of high-  quality  data  is  definitely  an  important  process  for  an  adequate level of model learning, but since such collec-  tion processes are not always viable, many studies tackle  this  issue  from the perspective of augmentation  using  pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019;  Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie  et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).  Two kinds of strategies are mainly adopted for natural  language data augmentation. The first is to collect data  using human resources, and the other is to create and  modify  data  mechanically  or  semi-automatically.  The  former guarantees data quality, but collecting and pre-  processing large-scale data manually is extremely time-  consuming  and  costly.  Therefore,  various  automation  strategies were proposed to overcome such limitation. In  representative approaches, data is augmented by using  a generation model or modifying a part of the text (Yu  et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al.,  2020).  As one of the studies using generation models, Yu et al.  (2018) proposed a back-translation method using both  direction of machine translation systems. Here, the data is  augmented  by  translating  an  English  sentence  into  French  and  then  translating  it  back  to  English  again  through a French-English translation model. However,  since semantic discrepancy can occur in the round-trip-  translation to other languages, the augmentation of nat-  ural  and  syntactically  plausible  sentences  is  often  not  guaranteed.  In the approach using text modification, data similar to  the original text is augmented by using strategies such  as replacing a specific word with a synonym, inserting  a random  word, changing the position of two random  words in a sentence, or deleting a random word (Wei and  Zou, 2019). Other studies investigated the effect of giv-  ing synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and  hypernym, and using semantic text exchange  (Feng et  al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, using a thesaurus  such as WordNet or a part-of-speech tagger usually re-  quires considerable amount of time and budget.  To attack the above limitations, we propose a data aug-            \fFigure 1: Architecture according to the proposed methods: (a) DAG (b) DAM (c) DAGAM  mentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation  model and character order change (COC) strategy. Our  methodology consists of  three steps (Figure 1). The first  is to augment data using a generation model on raw text,  which we define as data augmentation with generation  (DAG). The second is to augment data  using COC, a  strategy that corrupts some words appearing in raw text,  and  we define this as data  augmentation  with  modifi-  cation  (DAM).  Finally,  we  combine  the  two  methods  and  call  it  as  data  augmentation  with  generation  and  modification (DAGAM).  Our methodology is a simple and easy strategy to auto-  matically augment natural language data. We perform  data  augmentation  on  six  benchmark  datasets  in  text  classification task. To check the power of our scheme,  we use BERT, which is a representative Transformer-  based  pre-trained  language  model,  for  the  fine-tuning  and evaluation. The utility of our methodology is ver-  ified by performance improvement made on all of the  benchmark datasets, compared to the case no augmen-  tation.  The  contribution  of  our  work  to  the  field  is  as  follows:  \u2022  We  propose  DAG,  a  data  augmentation  method  using a generation model, DAM, a data augmenta-  tion method using character order changing (COC),  and  DAGAM,  a  combined  scheme  of  two  meth-  ods, verifying and comparing their utility through  BERT-based fine-tuning and evaluation.  community of industry and acdemia to easily ac-  cess data augmentation methodologies.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(680, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(680, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 38 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 38}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 680 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 680}, "function_call": "word_count_check(680, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_full_length": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"downstream task\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"natural language\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(680, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(680, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"]}}}

To prevent this from happening, seal off any open areas with chicken wire fencing. To keep skunks from digging or squeezing under, you\u2019ll need to make sure the chicken wire extends at least 1 foot (30\u00a0cm) under the ground.  If there\u2019s already a skunk living under your deck or another structure on your property, you will need to scare it out before sealing the area off. Try encouraging the skunk to leave by setting up a bright light or an ultrasonic deterrent to frighten it away.  Before setting up any deterrents, wait until you\u2019re pretty sure the skunk is away from its den. If you have a backyard shed, garage, or other outbuilding that a skunk can easily wander into, close it up and secure any possible entrances. Otherwise, skunks may come in to seek shelter or look for food. Check for holes or gaps that a skunk could get into and seal them off with wire mesh or another suitable material, such as cement or plaster. Piles of debris make tempting shelters for skunks. If you suspect you have a skunk in your yard, clear away any large piles of rocks, sticks, wood, junk, or lawn waste that it could be hiding under.  If you keep a firewood pile in your yard and are concerned about skunks denning under it, try putting a fence around it or spraying the area with a skunk deterrent, such as a castor oil spray or a commercial skunk repellent. You can also store cut lumber or firewood in a closed shed or other outbuilding, if you have one. If you find a suspected skunk den, loosely fill the hole with a light material, such as dead leaves, straw, crumpled paper, or dirt. If the den is occupied, the skunk will be able to push its way out. If the material remains undisturbed for 2-3 days, you can assume the den is unoccupied and seal it off more permanently, e.g., by blocking it off with wire.  If the den is still occupied, one option is to install a 1-way door at the entrance to the den. This device will allow skunks to leave the den, but they will not be able to go back inside once they\u2019ve left. You can buy 1-way animal doors online or from many home or garden supply stores. You can also try scaring any current occupants out of the den with a natural repellent or a sound or light deterrent. Skunks are a major barnyard pest due to their tendency to raid chicken coops and eat the eggs. If you keep chickens or other livestock that skunks might be interested in, secure the area by putting wire fencing around the coop. Make sure the wire extends at least 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) under the ground around the coop. Ideally, it should also extend horizontally away from the enclosure another 8 inches (20\u00a0cm), so that it forms an L shape. Skunks also like to eat bees and their larvae.

In addition to the IVAA website, you can look for jobs at www.virtualassistantjobs.com. A content-based website provides information on a specific subject such as baking pies, designing kitchens, or repairing bicycles. You don\u2019t need a product or service to get started - just a good idea. If you know a lot about a particular subject, consider sharing your knowledge with the rest of the world. And while you\u2019re at it, why not make a few bucks?  To make money, your website will need to attract a lot of traffic. If you have no technical expertise, hire a professional who specializes in web design and search engine optimization (SEO). SEO improves your site\u2019s interaction with users and search engines.  You\u2019ll have to decide on a domain name and hosting service\u2026and pay for each. Fortunately, this will cost you less than $10 per month.  Once your website is set up, start adding content. You can then advertise related products and services from other companies and receive a commission for sales or leads. Programs such as Google AdSense make this process quite simple. If you only want to make a little bit of money from, you can get paid to take part in mock juries and focus groups. Attorneys use these \u201cjuries\u201d to survey public opinion and help prepare for actual trials. To participate, you\u2019ll have to join a site and meet some basic juror qualifications. You can then review and respond to case materials at your convenience. Always read disclaimers. If you already have a job, and you work at a computer, ask your employer about working from home. Depending on your profession, you may have to continue working during normal business hours. Your employer may also ask you to take part in conference calls from time to time, but at least you\u2019ll be at home.  You should have a good reason for wanting to work at home before asking your employer about working remotely. If working remotely full-time is not an option, ask about working a few days per week at home and the other days in the office. Keep in mind that if you choose to work from home on a full-time basis, your status may change from full-time employee to independent contractor, and you could lose your benefits. If you do become an independent contractor, and your employer cannot supply you with work materials, your computer, internet service, and office supplies are tax deductible. If you have language expertise or an advanced degree (Master\u2019s or PhD) with teaching experience, you can teach online courses for colleges and universities as a part-time adjunct.

You could also include a few pieces that are made of chiffon, lace, or silk.  Avoid fabrics such as polyester, which are made synthetically. Look for fabrics that have are fair trade and ethically sourced. If you aren\u2019t sure and the shop owner can\u2019t tell you, you can also search the internet for brands that have pledged to make their clothing out of fair trade fabrics. The whole idea of bohemian style is free and flowing. Long maxi skirts or peasant skirts are good ideas, as well as tunics and light tops. Anything that makes you feel light and comfortable is a good choice.  You can also look for flowing dresses that you can then layer other pieces over or under to get an effortless look. Try to keep the layering towards the top of your body. You want the look the draw attention to your face, and if you do a lot of layering on the bottom (e.g. wearing pants under skirts) you will draw attention downwards which creates a \u201cheavy\u201d look. Though you can certainly wear everything loosely fitted, if you want to, you can also throw in a few fitted pieces. For example, if you are wearing a very flowy tunic, you might then put on a pair of tight leggings, which will give you a bit of shape while also emphasizing the flowy shirt. You are trying to create a sort of relaxed gypsy look. This means that you will want to layer clothes over each other to get a truly bohemian look. As the look has been inspired by travelling gypsies and hippies who travelled with everything they owned, this means that they layered clothing over other pieces to keep warm and to avoid having to carry extra clothing.  You can, for example, wear a tight fitting bralette under a flowing shirt, you can layer a jacket over a loose-fitting tunic, or even layer all three together. This has the added advantage that if you get warm or cold you always have a layer you can remove or put back on whenever you need to. A true bohemian is unlikely to purchase brand new clothing as the style focuses on vintage clothing in addition to caring for the environment. Head to your nearest flea market or thrift shop where you can probably find good deals on clothing, and you may even be able to find original pieces from the 1960s and 1970s, which will really boost your bohemian wardrobe.  If you know how to sew, you could even make your own clothing using whatever fabrics and patterns you like. If you do buy new clothing rather than going to your closest trendy clothing shop (think H&M) opt for independently owned small businesses where you can find out how and where the clothing was made. The clothing will certainly cost more, but it will also probably be of much better quality and will last you a lot longer.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [21]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.28571428571428575, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_full_length": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.75, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(21, \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(21, \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"21st sentence.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Especially if you're not picky about the make or model of your car, shop around and see who has the best deal.  Know your credit score and how qualified you are for different offers. Typically the best offers are only available for prime borrowers with credit in the 700s or higher. If you're trading in an old car, look for dealer offers to double the price on a trade-in, or pay a minimum amount for any trade-in regardless of its condition. If you've done your research, you have a few dealerships in mind. You should be able to evaluate their inventory online before you go visit in person. Find the best car for you, looking at overall price.  Dealers may advertise monthly payment amounts rather than total price. This can be a way to charge you a higher interest rate. Dealers typically will finance any car on their lot, so you may have more variety to choose from if you use dealer financing than you would if you used direct financing. However, this might not necessarily be a good thing \u2013 you still need to check the car's history and have it inspected before you buy. Cars depreciate in value. If you're buying a used car, you want to finance as little of the total price of the car as possible. A down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price of the car typically will get you the best rates. A sizable down payment can help you avoid being underwater on your loan \u2013 meaning you owe more for the car than it is worth. This is particularly important to avoid when you're financing a used car, which could develop mechanical problems relatively quickly. You'll need basic identification information as well as information about your income and employment to complete the financing application at the dealership.  It may take a few minutes, but in most cases the dealer will have a financing offer available for you that day. Then they'll call you back into an office to discuss the terms you've been offered. The finance company may require additional documents from you, such as pay stubs to verify income. If the dealer mentions any of these, make sure you get copies to the dealer as soon as possible so as not to jeopardize your financing offer. If you've done your research and know your credit score, you may be able to get better terms from the dealer than what you're initially offered. Review each term and see if you can improve it. For example, you typically want the shortest term loan, since it will usually have the lowest interest rates. But dealers often focus on the amount of the monthly payment. Financing for a shorter term does mean a higher monthly payment, but it will save you money overall. Dealers tend to tack on extra fees, including sales tax, registration fees, and document or destination fees. You also may end up paying extra for dealer warranties, especially for a used car. The dealer typically has no problem rolling these extra fees into your financing, but there's no point in paying interest on fees and tax.

Examples include the sentiment or speci\ufb01city of language used by companies when discussing climate risks and measuring corporate climate change exposure, which increases transparency to help the public know where we stand on climate change (e.g., Callaghan et al. 2021; Bingler et al. 2022b). Many studies in this domain apply traditional NLP methods, such as dictionaries, bag-of-words approaches or simple extensions thereof (e.g., Gr\u00a8uning 2011; Sautner et al. 2022). However, such analyses face considerable limitations, since climate-related wording could vary substantially by source (Kim and Kang 2018). Deep learning techniques that promise higher accuracy are gradually replacing these approaches (e.g., K\u00a8olbel et al. 2020; Luccioni, Baylor, and Duchene 2020; Bingler et al. 2022a; Callaghan et al. 2021; Wang, Chillrud, and McKeown 2021; Friederich et al. 2021). Indeed, it has been shown in related domains that Copyright  Intelligence (www.aaai.org).  deep learning in NLP allows for impressive results, outperforming traditional methods by large margins (Varini et al. 2020). These deep learning-based approaches make use of language models (LMs), which are trained on large amounts of textual and unlabelled data. This training on unlabelled data is called pretraining and leads to the model learning representations of words and patterns of common language. One of the most prominent language models is called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) (Devlin et al. 2018) with its successors ROBERTA (Liu et al. 2019), Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) and ELECTRA (Clark et al. 2020). These models have been trained on huge amounts of text which was crawled from an unprecedented amount of online resources. After the pretraining phase, most LMs are trained on additional tasks, the downstream task. For the downstream tasks, the LM builds on and bene\ufb01ts from the word representations and language patterns learned in the pretraining phase. The pre-training bene\ufb01t is especially large on downstream tasks for which the collection of samples is dif\ufb01cult and, thus, the resulting training datasets are small (hundreds or few thousands of samples). Furthermore, it has been shown that a model that was pretrained on the downstream task-speci\ufb01c text exhibits better performance, compared to a model that has been pretrained solely on general text (Araci 2019; Lee et al. 2020). Hence, a straightforward extension to the standard combination of pretraining is the so-called domain-adaptive pretraining (Gururangan et al. 2020). This approach has recently been studied for various tasks and basically comes in the form of pretraining multiple times \u2014 in particular pretraining in the language domain of the downstream task, i.e., pretraining (general domain) + domain-adaptive pretraining (downstream domain) + training (downstream task). To date, regardless of the increase in using NLP for climate change related research, a model with climate domainadaptive pretraining has not been publicly available, yet. Research so far rather relied on models pretrained on general language, and \ufb01ne-tuned on the downstream task. To             \f\ufb01ll this gap, our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce CLIMATEBERT, a state-of-the-art language model that is speci\ufb01cally pretrained on climate-related text corpora of various sources, namely news, corporate disclosures, and scienti\ufb01c articles. This language model is designed to support researchers of various disciplines in obtaining better performing NLP models for a manifold of downstream tasks in the climate change domain. Second, to illustrate the strength of CLIMATEBERT, we highlight the performance improvements using CLIMATEBERT on three standard climate-related NLP downstream tasks. Third, to further promote research at the intersection of climate change and NLP, we make the training code and weights of all language models publicly available at GitHub and Hugging Face.12", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(540, \"less than\"); word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 540 tokens and more than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 540, "min_cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(540, \"less than\"); word_count_check(520, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 12th, and 22th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [12, 22]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 31 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.33333333333333337, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 0.6153846153846154, "simpo_iter2": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo_iter3": 0.5454545454545454}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"], "base": [], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11, 21], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"climate-related\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"12th\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"22nd\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11, 21], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(12, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check(22, \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"]}}}

These supplies include:  Digital thermometer: A digital thermometer is best, as it will beep when the temperature becomes stable. It will also keep the temperature displayed in the display window for you to easily record the temperature if needed. Purchase a digital thermometer at your local drug store. This can be a regular \u201coral\u201d or \u201crectal\u201d thermometer, which are basically the same thing. Dedicate this thermometer for use with your horse. If you are unable to get a digital thermometer, a mercury thermometer works just as well. Double check to make sure that it is clean and does not have any cracks, as this can be very dangerous for the horse. Gentle lubricant. You also need a gentle lubricant to ease the passing of the thermometer into the horse's rectum. Vaseline or KY Jelly is ideal. These products are readily available at grocery stores and drug stores. A pair of latex or rubber gloves. Cotton wool or tissue and rubbing alcohol. It\u2019s best to time taking a horse\u2019s temperature for just after he has passed stool. This will reduce the possibility that you will insert the thermometer into dung. Dung registers a higher temperature reading and your reading will not accurately reflect the horse\u2019s body temperature. Try feeding the horse or giving it a treat. This way, the horse will begin to trust you. . Usually, the owner of the horse will be the one taking the temperature. However, in instances where you may be taking care of a friend's horse or you're relatively new to first aid for horses, you need to become familiar with the horse. You also need to let the horse become familiar with you.  Talk soothingly to your horse. Feed it a little treat, such as a carrot or apple. Scratch your horse\u2019s nose or behind its ears. . Ensure that the horse doesn't move around too much while you are taking his temperature. Tie him up to a wooden fence or post. Use a quick release knot so you can release him quickly if he gets spooked or agitated. A helper can hold the horse and talk soothingly to him as you take the temperature. This not only reduces the risk of getting kicked and/or trampled. It also means that you can concentrate on the job at hand while another person watches the horse's reactions and informs you of what the horse is doing. If you are using a digital thermometer, switch it on. Make sure that the digital display appears in the display window. This will ensure that the thermometer is working correctly and that the battery is not dead. Wait until the digital display is flashing L (for low temperature reading). This will flash for approximately 10 seconds before registering a reading of a low or normal temperature. If you\u2019re using a traditional mercury thermometer, shake it vigorously two or three times to make sure that the mercury has returned to the bulb prior to use. If you don\u2019t take this step with a mercury thermometer, the mercury will read a previous \"high\" and you will get a false reading. This is best done by dipping the bulb end (the end that inserts into the anus) with a blob of Vaseline or KY Jelly. Once this is done, you are ready to take the horse's temperature. Prevent your horse from getting spooked by standing on the mounting side. Most horses are trained to be handled on the near side (for mounting, catching, etc). . Move toward the rear of the horse from the front at an angle. This allows the horse to see you, as horses have a blind spot directly behind him and directly in front of him. You will be much less likely to startle him if you come from an angle.  Run one hand along the horse\u2019s back, maintaining his attention and reassuring him that you are still there. Stand close to the horse's rump to avoid being kicked. Never under any circumstances stand directly behind the horse. If he kicks out, you could be seriously injured or even killed.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25], \"change\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 1 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 1}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.6, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25], \"change\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(1, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"horse's\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"]}}}

This last July the band reformed and traveled to Bogota, Colombia to play a show. It was fun and a bit surreal to reunite and work with the other members after all the time off. It was also pretty humorous to see how quickly we all settled in to our old behaviors. Traveling as a group can be stressful especially when you have to transport instruments that the TSA views with suspicion and attempts to disassemble, which is what happened to me. Thankfully I was able to get everything working for the concert.  We had a full day in Bogota before the show, which we spent hanging out with a promoter with whom we had worked before on a previous trip. He took us to local restaurants and record stores which we never would have stumbled on by ourselves. Then that evening there was a party at a record store in kind of a hipster area of town. After that we headed to a small jazz club where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing. It was a small cafe with a prominently displayed triptych of chairman Mao. There are very good painters in Bogota and there are very elaborate murals to be seen everywhere and even the graffiti approaches high art. The show was a double bill with another band and took place in a very large 5000 seat auditorium, even though neither band had the capacity to draw that many people. Even though the whole organization was very professionally run, sound check seemed to last forever and resulted in my not being able to have lunch with an old friend who I hadn't seen for years. But the concert itself went well there was a good showing on the ground floor seats, but the balconies remained unused. Afterwards I was able to meet up with my friend and go out for some drinks. The day after the show was spent in the studio collaborating with the band with whom we had shared the bill, and felt like equal parts work and social occasion. Some friends of the other band who are foodie types, prepared a meal for everyone, and there was plenty of beer and wine and general frivolity. Our last day in Bogota was open so the guitarist and keyboardist and I went to the National museum, which is a sprawling, long and narrow building with lots of interactive exhibits on everything about Colombian culture past and present.

These come in all shapes and sizes, from full strips that fit your entire lashline to individual clusters that you can place exactly where you want a little extra length.  Try full strip false lashes if you\u2019re feeling especially dramatic. These will give you a major length boost. Individual lashes work best if you want a more natural, subtle look. You may need to cut or trim strip lashes to fit your eye shape. Always test a pair before trying to put them on. To secure the lashes to your lid, apply lash glue to the false lash band or cluster. Let the glue sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If it feels slightly tacky, you\u2019re doing it right. Set the lashes just above your natural lash line, starting at the outer corner and pressing inward to secure them.  When you\u2019re applying your lashes, set your mirror below you and tilt your chin downward so you can place the lashes at the right angle. After all, titled or lopsided lashes are not ideal. After you\u2019ve applied the lashes to your eye, let them sit for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that the glue has bonded with your skin. You don\u2019t want one of these guys falling off mid-day! To remove the lashes at the end of the day, simply peel up one of the edges and gently pull the lashes off. You may need to use eye makeup remover to remove any glue residue from your lashes or skin. Straight lashes can look shorter and sparser. That\u2019s where the trusty eyelash curler comes in. Curling your lashes helps lift the them so they look long and fluttery. Take your eyelash curler, and curl your lashes along their entire length for the longest look.  You can purchase an eyelash curler at drugstores, beauty supply stores, or any store that sells cosmetics. Start with the eyelash curler at the base of your lashes, and hold it closed for approximately 3 seconds. Next, move the curler to the center of your lashes and hold it closed for another 3 seconds. Finally, place the curler at the end of your lashes and hold it closed for a final 3 seconds. Ta-da! Instantly longer lashes. If you don\u2019t have an eyelash curler, a clean toothbrush is a surprisingly good stand-in.  Run the brush under hot water and then dry it lightly with a clean towel. Next, run the brush through your lashes, starting at the base and holding it at the tips for several seconds to create the curl. Eyeliner, mascara's partner in crime, can actually be used alone to lengthen lashes! Instead of applying the liner to your lid, trace it right along the base of your lashes. Next, gently pull up on your eyelid to expose the underside of your lashline, also known as the tightline, and apply liner there as well to make your lashes appear thicker and longer.  Use a dark eyeliner so it blends in with your lashes. Black is usually the best option, but if your lashes are light, you might want to pick a brown liner. For the liner at the base of your lashes, you have a ton of options: try pencil, powder, liquid, or cream eyeliner. For the tightline, use a pencil or cream liner.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 33th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [33]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'the end of the day'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "the end of the day", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.4444444444444445, "sft": 0.75, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"avoid the end of the day\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day.\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["keyword_frequency_check(\"the end of the day\", 1, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([33], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the end of the day\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}
