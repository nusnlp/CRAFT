These LLMs are typically pre-trained on a large amount of natural language corpus and then fine-tuned on the specific downstream tasks\u2019 datasets. Recent works [3, 53, 106, 117] demonstrate the success of LLMs can be explained by the fact that language models act as knowledge bases, which refers to implicitly storing the knowledge learned from training datasets in the parameters as internal memory and generating responses by retrieving answers from memory. To store more knowledge for better generation performance, existing works generally enlarge the memory capacity by increasing the volume of parameters [1, 11, 54, 78]. Although existing LLMs have shown great power, there are still several challenges hindering the development of LLMs. One of the most prominent challenges is the hallucination problem [23, 69, 70], which refers to the tendency of LLMs to generate responses that are coherent and fluent but factually incorrect. Another big challenge is the knowledge update issue. To update the knowledge stored in the LLMs\u2019 internal memory [106, 146, 168], it is necessary to retrain/fine-tune LLMs with new data, which is a costly process. Another challenge for general LLMs is lacking of domain-specific expertise [20, 133, 134, 166]. Training a domain-specific LLM, however, demands considerable manpower for dataset collection. To address these challenges, recent works [10, 49, 87] have proposed leveraging an external knowledge database to augment LLMs, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By supplying LLMs with retrieved relevant factual information, the hallucination problem can be alleviated to some extent. Besides, the knowledge update issue can also be addressed by updating the external knowledge database, which can augment LLMs with up-to-date knowledge. RAG can also convert a general LLM into a domain-specific LLM by constructing and utilizing a domain-specific knowledge database. Therefore, RAG plays an important role in augmenting the functionality of LLMs, making them more accurate, knowledgeable, and reliable in a wide range of applications. Contributions: This paper reviews all techniques involved in RAG for natural language processing. Although there are several survey papers for RAG [41, 59, 88, 162, 171], our survey still has some key insights, (1) This paper systematically introduces each component of RAG, including details about the retriever from building to querying, and techniques of the retrieval fusions with tutorial codes. (2) This paper exhibits different RAG training strategies, including RAG with/without datastore update. (3) This paper further discusses the applications of RAG on downstream NLP tasks and practical NLP scenarios. (4) This paper finally identifies promising future directions for exploring and main challenges for addressing. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of RAG. Section 3 and Section 4 comprehensively introduce all technical details used in retrievers and retrieval fusions. Section 6 presents how to train the RAG with/without new knowledge. Section 7 presents the techniques used in representative NLP tasks. Section 8 shows the applications of RAG in practical NLP scenarios. Section 9 discusses the future directions of RAG.

However, their practical utility depends on their ability to follow instructions or constraints at various granularity, encompassing user and system requirements. Recent studies (Sun et al., 2023) indicate that LLMs struggle with fine-grained constraints in natural language prompts, especially in paraphrase generation and numerical planning tasks. While previous work studied the controllability of language models (LMs) using fine-grained instructions in natural language (NL) format, the necessity to represent instructions in code format arises from a critical enterprise use case involvIn enterprises, ing system-level programming. Listing 1: The JSON sample generated (highlighted in yellow) by the Granite 20B model does not adhere to the minContains and subsequent numerical constraints. Write a JSON sample with field values as per the JSON format schema given below . { \" type \": \" array \", \" contains \": { \" type \": \" number \", \" multipleOf \": 2 .6 6, \" exclusiveMinimum \": 0.082318859 95 43 52 84 , \" exclusiveMaximum \": 5.110023353 54 78 } , \" minContains \": 7 } JSON sample : ``` [2.66, 5.22, 8.88, 12.54, 16.2, 19.86, 23.52, 27.18] \u201c\u2018 system-level code integrity is maintained through use-case-specific constraints, typically encoded using schemas. Schemas are instructions in structured code languages like JSON, YAML, XML, or Python to enforce constraints like data types and required fields, ensuring code integrity. For example, the schema in Listing 1 requires the sample to be an array of numbers. Each number must be a multiple of 2.66 and fall within the range defined by the exclusiveMinimum and exclusiveMaximum fields. Additionally, the array must contain at least seven elements. Following such schema constraints, developers write system-level code in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in a format similar to JSON, YAML, or XML. DSLs are custom languages with specialized schemas and syntax suitable for a particular domain or application. These DSLs are common for tasks like data exchange and system configuration, such as in Kubernetes2. Writing DSL code requires deep domain expertise and a significant learning process for developers. This has led to a growing adoption of LLMs for system-level programming in several *The first two 22 g u A3 ] E S . s c [ v83.02 : v i X r a             \fproducts such as Ansible Lightspeed3. Given the cruciality of factoring in schemas with LLMs, there is increasing interest in using constrained decoding for DSLs (Pimparkhede et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a). However, given its limitations (Appendix A.4), it is necessary to evaluate if LMs are cognizant of code constraints when directly presented as a part of the prompt. Therefore, we aim to study the controllability of LMs through two novel seed tasks: (i) Data as Code generation: valid sample generation factoring in constraints (ii) DSL validation: validate code against constraints. We evaluate two model families, Llama and Granite, ranging from 8B to 70B parameters, aligning with enterprise needs for system-level tasks, where open-source models provide an economical and transparent alternative to black-box models like GPT-4. Both tasks are highly motivated from research and enterprise use case point of view as detailed in Appendix A.5.

Ensure the output has fewer than 32 sentences. Keep the 13th sentence unchanged:\n\nThe consonants b, d, f, l, m, n, v, and z are all pronounced the same in French as they are in English. These letters never vary in pronunciation, although they may be silent. With the exception of f and l, all of these letters are silent at the end of words. However, if the word that follows starts with a vowel, they will be pronounced as usual. There are 2 French consonants that look like English letters, but make completely different sounds. If English is your first language, these may trip you up at first. You'll get them with practice.  The French j sounds like the s in the English word \"measure.\" The French q or qu always sounds like the k in the English word \"kit.\" Several French consonants have different pronunciations depending on the vowel that follows them or where they are in a word. Many of these are similar to \"hard\" and \"soft\" consonants in English.  When it comes before an e or an i, the letter c sounds like an s, similar to the \"soft c\" in the English word \"menace.\" Otherwise, the letter c sounds like a k. However, there are some French words in which the c sounds like an s even though it isn't followed by an e or an i. For these, an accent mark is added to the letter, and you have \u00e7 as in the word \u00e7a (pronounced sah, meaning \"that\"). When a g comes before an e or an i, it sounds like the s in the English word \"measure.\" Elsewhere, it makes a hard g sound like the g in the English word \"go.\" The French s sounds the same as the English s at the beginning of a word. However, whenever it is between 2 vowels, it sounds like the English z. The French r is spoken from the back of your throat, similar to the sound you make when gargling. You make the sound by pressing the back of your tongue against your throat as you push air around it.  To practice, try gargling a liquid in your upper throat and making a sound at the same time. When you can do this consistently, try the same thing again, but with no liquid. The French r has no equivalent sound in English, so it can be difficult. However, if you simply pronounce it the same as an English r, you won't be able to pronounce French words correctly. In French, the letter h is never pronounced with a hard h sound, as in English. This is true no matter where the letter is in the word. Even if a word starts with an h, it still isn't pronounced.  For example, the word hiver (winter) is pronounced ee-vair. The consonant blend ch is most commonly pronounced like an sh. In a few loanwords from other languages, it is pronounced like a k, but never like the ch in the English word \"chatter.\" These consonants are aspirated in English, which means that you blow a puff of air out of your mouth when you pronounce them. However, in French, these consonants are typically not aspirated.  French speakers do occasionally aspirate these consonants, but only if they are angry or upset about something. So aspirating these consonants can send the wrong impression and my offend someone. To practice, put a piece of paper in front of your mouth and say the word paper. If the paper moves, you are aspirating. Keep practicing until you get it right.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 32 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 13th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [13]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Whenever it is between 2 vowels, it sounds like the English z.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence has more than five words, and the output has fewer than 640 words:\n\nIt should be at least 1.5 times your bird\u2019s adult wingspan in width, depth, and height, so as to allow your bird to move freely. Bigger is even better. For a list of suggested cage sizes by bird, see bird-cage.com. In general:  The minimum height should be 3 times the length from head to tail of the bird. There should be at least 2 wing beats between perches. Your bird should be able to turn around on his perch without his tail feathers hitting the cage. Even small birds require large cages. Two finches, for instance, require 3-4 square feet of space, so they will have room to fly around. Your bird should not be able to put its head between the bars. Appropriate bar widths are:  Under \u00bd\u201d \u2013 For small birds such as finches, canaries, parrotlets, parakeets, and lovebirds 1/2\u201d to 3/4\u201d \u2013 For medium birds such as cockatiels, conures, lories, and senegals 3/4\u201d to 1-1/4\u201d \u2013 For large birds such as African greys, Amazons, macaws, and cockatoos Adding more corners decreases the flight area and makes the cage less safe. A long low cage is better than a narrow high one (such as a parrot cage) because it allows the birds to fly and glide. Your bird will spend most of its time standing, so having an adequate number of perches is vital to your bird\u2019s health and happiness. For most birds, you will want to provide a natural branch perch and a manmade perch, one near the food and water and another near the toys, as well as a concrete perch elsewhere in the cage. Be sure to avoid plastic perches, which can cause problems if eaten, and sandpaper perches, which can scratch your bird\u2019s feet.  Concrete perch \u2013 These solid perches provide a good place for birds to groom. They should be set away from food, water and toys. Natural branch perch \u2013 These are better than wooden dowels because their uneven shape means the bird will put pressure on different parts of its feet each time it perches. Choose branches from orchard wood trees such as apple, plum, pear, but not cherry. Cut the branch to fit the cage, scrub and clean it with detergent, and let it dry in the sun. Next, heat the branch for 45 minutes in a 200\u00b0F oven to kill any insects. Allow to cool before placing it in your bird\u2019s cage. Manmade perch \u2013 Untreated cotton rope makes for a good perch, as it is toxin free and can be easily washed. Your bird will spend countless hours trying to open the door to its cage, so the door had better be escape-proof. If you are worried that your bird might escape, you can use a padlock, clip, or small carabiner to secure the door. Double-check your bird\u2019s seed and water supply daily, especially if a child is in charge of caring for the bird. If using a water bottle, check to be sure that it is unclogged and working properly. Three days without water is enough to kill most birds. Birds need to bathe regularly to keep their feathers and skin healthy. Always use room temperature water, as hot water will strip essential oils from your bird\u2019s feathers. If you put a birdbath in your bird\u2019s cage, make sure to clean it and change the water daily. Alternately, you can mist your bird with a spray bottle once or twice a week. Some birds like to wash in the sink or even in the shower. Your bird will chew on its toys, so make sure they are not made from wood treated with toxic chemicals or soft plastic that you bird can swallow. Be sure to rotate toys at least once a week to keep your bird stimulated, as boredom can lead to health problems in your bird. You can use a cover designed for the cage, though an old sheet or pillowcase also works fine. Covering your bird\u2019s cage keeps out drafts and allows the bird to sleep even when you are up late with the lights on. Birds need at least 10 hours of sleep a night, so providing a dark, quiet area for your bird at night is important to prevent sleep deprivation.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 640 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 640}, "function_call": "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.2, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "tool1 = text_eval()", "tool2 = word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "tool3 = sentence_count_check(100, \"more than\")", "for i in range(len(some_sentences)):", "tool4 = sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "Note: For simplicity, `some_sentences` is an example and should be replaced with the actual list of sentences from the given text."], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(100, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

Support is essential for an effective English essay, so do not try to write your essay without these materials. If you have time, read through your notes before you begin. Make sure that you have your outline handy as well. You can build on your outline by expanding on each of the points in the order that they are listed in. Topic sentences signal to readers what a paragraph will discuss. Start each of your paragraphs with a topic sentence so that your instructor will be able to see that your ideas progress in a clear, direct manner.  Think of the topic sentence as a way to tell readers what you'll talk about in the rest of the paragraph. You don\u2019t need to summarize the whole paragraph\u2014just provide readers with a taste. For example, in a paragraph that describes Okonkwo\u2019s rise and fall in Things Fall Apart, you might begin with something like: \u201cOkonkwo starts out as a poor young man, but then rises to a position of wealth and status.\u201d Make sure that you include as many details as possible throughout your essay. Remember that padding (filling in with meaningless text or using extra wordy sentences) is not an effective strategy for writing essays because instructors can see right through it. Your instructor has probably read hundreds of student essays over their career, so they'll know when an essay has been padded. Fill your essays with details that make your essay useful and insightful instead. If you get stuck, some good strategies for developing your ideas include:   Returning to the invention stage. This includes exercises such as freewriting, listing, or clustering. You can also revisit your notes and books to see if there's anything you missed or forgot.  Visiting your school\u2019s writing lab. You can find a writing lab on most college campuses. They are free to students and can help you improve your writing at any stage in the writing process.  Talking to your instructor. Take advantage of your professor's office hours or one-on-one appointments.  Meet with them and discuss ways that you can improve your essay before you hand it in. . If you use any sources at all in your essay, then you will need to cite them using the style that your instructor prefers. MLA style is the most common citation format used in English courses, so you will need to know how to use it. Provide in-text citations as well as a works cited page at the end.  An MLA style works cited page starts on a new page at the end of the essay. Provide entries for each of the sources that you used. These entries should include the information necessary to allow the reader to find the source with ease.  MLA style in-text (also called parenthetical) citations provide readers with the author\u2019s last name the page number for the information. It's necessary to include an in-text citation for any information that you quote, summarize, or paraphrase from a source. It comes right after the sourced information, and it includes the author\u2019s last name and page number in parentheses. The general structure of an essay usually goes from broad to specific. You could visualize this tendency as an upside-down pyramid or as a funnel. By the time you get to your conclusion, it should feel as though the information in your conclusion is inevitable. It's essentially a recap of everything you've spent your whole essay trying to prove.  However, there is also potential to use your conclusion for other purposes.  You may find that you want to use your conclusion to:  Qualify or complicate the information in your essay Suggest a need for further research Speculate on how the future will change the current situation\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\"); word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 48 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 48}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens and more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 400, "min_cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\"); word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.28571428571428575, "sft": 0.4, "simpo": 0.75, "simpo_iter2": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(47, 'less than')", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, 'more than')", "sentence_length_check(47, 'less than')"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(48, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(48, \"less than\")"]}}}

This task, commonly referred to as Split *Equal contribution. and Rephrase (SPRP) (Narayan et al., 2017), also provides a relevant framework to evaluate natural language processing models, as complex linguistic properties need to be tackled to provide optimal splits and appropriate rephrasing. The SPRP task is typically performed via dedicated transformation models, e.g. sequence-tosequence modelling with a copy mechanism (Aharoni and Goldberg, 2018) or graph-based neural segmentation (Gao et al., 2021). The main limitation for this type of approach is the dependency on training datasets of paired complex and split sentences, which are scarce across languages and domains. As an alternative, Kim et al. (2021) exploit one-to-many alignments in parallel corpora and pivot machine translation (MT) to create an aligned corpus of complex and split sentences, which can in turn be exploited by sequence-to-sequence models. For this type of approach, the main bottleneck is the dependency on parallel corpora with sufficient many-to-one alignments and on quality pivot machine translation models. Large language models (LLMs), such as the GPT models (Radford et al., 2018) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have demonstrated their strong potential on a large number of downstream tasks (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In this work, we measure their performance on the SPRP task, prompting the models to generate split and rephrase hypotheses from complex sentences. We evaluate different variants of the approach on datasets of varying complexity, contrasting zero shot, few shot in-context learning, and fine-tuning scenarios. We notably measure the impact of parameter and training data size, domain shift, and prompt optimisation. Overall, our results demonstrate that LLMs outperform the previous state of the art by large margins across multiple metrics, with remaining relative deficiencies, notably in terms of split generation. Results from two human evaluations, a 22 n u J ] L C . s c [ v71.12 : v i X r a             \fcomparative 3-way ranking task and a qualitative evaluation, further support our conclusions.

Most times, the water supply valve for your tub is located in the walls behind the faucet. Go into the room adjacent to your bathroom to cut a hole in the wall where the drain and faucets are for your tub. Use a stud finder so you don\u2019t accidentally cut into one of the studs. Cut an 8\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a08\u00a0in (20\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a020\u00a0cm) square in the drywall with a reciprocating saw to expose the pipes.  If you can\u2019t access the room adjacent to the drain, cut a hole in the floor beneath the bathroom using a reciprocating saw. Make sure you\u2019re underneath where the tub drains. Wear safety glasses while working with your saw. to your bathroom. The water supply for your tub is either controlled by a valve in the wall behind your faucet or by the main water pump. Turn the valve so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipes to turn it off.  If your valve shut-off is circular, look for the directions printed on the valve head to figure out which way to turn it. If you cannot turn off the water for your tub or bathroom, you may need to turn it off for the entire home or building. . Locate the screw on the underside of the faucet or where it connects to the wall. Use a flathead or Phillips screwdriver to remove the screw. If it doesn\u2019t have a screw, tighten the jaws of a pipe wrench around  the back of the faucet and twist it counterclockwise until it\u2019s loose. Then, pull it out. If you want to save the faucet, put a rag in between it and the wrench so you don\u2019t leave any scratches. A drain removal tool is a cylinder that fits into the drain to loosen its connection to the pipes. Put the end of a drain remover tool in the drain hole and turn it counterclockwise. Keep turning the tool until the drain is loose and you can pull it out by hand. Unscrew the overflow drain, located on the front wall of your tub, and pull it off of the surface.  Drain removers can be bought from your local hardware store. Some tub drains have screens that you need to remove with a screwdriver before you can use the remover tool. The drain shoe is made up of the pipes that connect the overflow and the main drain to your tub. Look for the T-shaped connector holding the pipes together, and use a pipe wrench to twist the drain shoe off of the main pipes. If the joint is stuck or won\u2019t come out with a pipe wrench, cut through the pipes with a reciprocating saw or hacksaw. and drywall around your tub. The surround is the tile or fiberglass on the walls around your tub. Use a pry bar or the back of a claw hammer to rip the surround away from your tub. When you reach the drywall, use a razor knife to cut out the area around that extends 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) from the top of your tub until the studs are exposed.  Wear safety glasses, work gloves, and a respirator to keep yourself protected. If your tub has a surround panel made from fiberglass, you need to take out the entire piece in order to install a new bathtub. The flange around your tub is the raised edge that keeps water from draining into your walls. Use an electric screwdriver or the back of your claw hammer to remove the screws or nails from the flange. Make sure to check each stud around your bath for any nails. Some older tubs may not be nailed or screwed into the wall. Run a razor knife through the caulk or sealant surrounding your tub. Cut through the line of sealant that connects the apron, or front of your tub, to the floor. Grab the tub from the side opposite of the drain and lift it out from its place. Have a partner help slide the tub backward away from the drain pipes. Stand the tub upright and work together to carry it out from your bathroom.

After so many years of hard work, sleepless nights, working over the weekends, working more than 40 hours per week, after my college degree and certifications that I took in school I got promoted at work! My Manager ask me if we can have a quick meeting today to discuss some personal projects about my development here at work, and at the beginning of the meeting everything went smoothly, we were talking about new projects that were coming up and how I was doing in my current role. Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title. At that moment I was shaking and feeling anxious because this is an important moment of my life, and that I know that I have the potential to do more here in the company. After I signed those papers I tell thank you to my boss for this amazing opportunity of advancement in my career and I will never let him down in my new position. He said congratulations you deserve it, and I want to see more awesome things here at work. Then I left his office and I immediately called my wife and tell her the notice of my promotion and she was so happy because it is a new chapter for our life, with our new baby and kid, more money for the family and a bright future here in the company. It is a very emotional moment for me and my family, that I will never forget. After that I called my dad and mom to tell them the notice of my promotion here at work, my mom was all happy and she was telling how smart I'm and to be thankful with God for every step that I do at my career here at work. In the other hand my dad was kind of surprised, but he told me to shot for the top, keep fighting for your dreams and keep fighting for your family, because at the end they are all depending in your salary/money for a place to live, pay rent, groceries, entertainment. But at the end I know that he was happy but he wants me to see like in a Director/Managerial position, he always tells me that I have a lot of potential and that I'm very smart in whatever I do. Then after talking with my dad and mom, I give the surprise to my mom and father in law, they were so happy and pride that I got that promotion, because they know how much did I suffer to get that promotion and they gave me their best wishes and blessing to my family and always to look forward of new opportunities wherever I go.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], \"change\")"]}}}

It can be difficult dealing with underlying pain due to  a difficult childhood or a difficult marriage where abuse patterns are prevalent, but we can take control of our own lives by addressing our emotional difficulties, helping ourselves, and overcoming our addictions. Our thoughts tend to be linked to our feelings and behaviors. In order words, our perceptions of ourselves and the world dictate how we feel and act.  These ideas are central to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a type of treatment that is commonly used to treat self-destructive behaviors.  Write down the thoughts that you associate with each of your self-destructive behaviors. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I think right before I do this? What thoughts influence and maintain this behavior?\u201d For example, if alcohol use is the problem, one might think, \u201cI'll just have one drink. I really need this drink. I deserve to drink. Nothing bad will happen.\u201d These are the thoughts that encourage a person to consume alcohol. Acknowledge your negative thinking habits. Some of these might include: catastrophizing (thinking the worst will happen), over-generalizing (also known as black and white thinking, where one tends to think something is either all good or all bad), mind-reading (thinking you know what others are thinking), and predicting the future (thinking you know what will happen). For instance, if you believe that another person is thinking something bad about you, this could result in you feeling depressed or angry, which could trigger self-destructive behaviors. If you modify this thinking you can prevent the negative emotion and behavior. If we change our thoughts, our feelings and behaviors will follow. Once you have a complete list of the thoughts, you can begin to challenge these thoughts when they come up. Keep a thought diary.  Identify the situation, feeling, and thought. Then identify ideas that support the thought, and ideas that do not support the thought. Finally, use this information to create a thought that is more realistic. For example, if the situation is your mother yelling at you, you might have felt angry, and thought, \u201cShe's the worst mother.\u201d Ideas that support this thought might be: she yells, and she doesn't know how to communicate calmly. Ideas that refute this idea might be: she tells me she loves me, she provides me with food and housing, she supports me, and so on. A more balanced perspective overall (in order to counteract the thought that she is the worst mother) could be, \u201cMy mother has her faults and she does yell sometimes, but I know that she is trying to help and that she loves me.\u201d This thought may lead to less anger, and thus, a healthier behavior (instead of drinking alcohol or socially isolating). Once you identify your unhelpful thinking, and develop alternative thoughts, you need to practice changing these thoughts as they come up. Be aware of any negative emotion you have (anger, sadness, stress), and identify the thoughts you are having in the moment.  You can refer back to your thought diary to assist you. Then, actively change the thought you are having. If you are thinking, \u201cMy mother is terrible and doesn't love me,\u201d remember the alternative thought you identified before and repeat it to yourself over and over, \u201cMy mother loves me but she sometimes loses her temper.\" Log your progress and learn from mistakes. Continue to keep a diary of situations that could lead to self-destructive behaviors. If you identify negative thoughts, write down alternative thoughts that might produce a better outcome. If self-destructive behavior was used, identify an alternative. For example, if the situation was your mother yelling at you, you may have thought, \u201cI can't stand her. She doesn't care about me,\u201d followed by feelings of anger and resentment, followed by a behavior of locking yourself in your room and isolating from social contact for several days. Identify another way you could have thought and dealt with the situation. For instance, you could change the though to, \"I love her despite her weaknesses, and I know she cares about me even when she acts this way.\" Try to think those thoughts the next time the situation occurs (your mother yells). Then, you may feel better and attempt to reconcile instead of engaging in a self-destructive behavior.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 32 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 39 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 39}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(39, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should have fewer than 29 words:\n\nSince tension is bound to occur in friendships and relationships, it is crucial that you can express your feelings clearly. When you are owning and examining your feelings, you have the opportunity to handle this tension smoothly. And, speaking expressively will open space for other people to express how they feel, and work through these different feelings together.  Start by listening. Make sure to acknowledge what the person is saying before you counter with your own views. Use \"I\" statements. A simple way to avoid being too confrontational is to tell people what you're experiencing rather than what they're doing wrong. For example, you can say \"When you're late to our coffee dates, I feel like you don't value my time\" rather than \"You're always late and it's really rude.\" As strange as it sounds, sometimes people don't know what's acceptable behavior. Acceptable behavior to one person can be unacceptable to another. In order for people to know what you are willing to put up with, be upfront and make it clear.  For example, if being late to coffee dates is your pet peeve, let them know. They might have no clue what effect their behavior has on you. If the person is really toxic, this strategy may not work, but it's good practice for setting boundaries regardless. This ties into effective arguing, but speaking assertively is something you can do all the time, whether you're arguing or not. Being an assertive speaker will help improve your communication and relationships.  Try to figure out where you could use some improvement. Maybe you're easily intimidated and people tend to step all over you, especially if they have a toxic personality. Identify the problem area as a first step. Reflect on tactics for specific situations. Maybe your toxic friend asks you for money and you have a hard time saying no. What can you do in these situations? Could you rehearse a simple script for the next time they ask? For example, you could say \"I care about you, but I'm not able to give you any more money.\" Practice responding assertively in your life. You can use techniques like the \"broken record,\" where you simply repeat yourself if they argue about what you've said. Start small if this is difficult for you, such as saying no (when appropriate) to family members or non-toxic friends. Be aware of what goes on inside your relationships with toxic people. For example, avoid taking everything they say at face value if you've noticed a tendency for them to be harsh and critical toward you. Protect yourself in these relationships, if you choose to continue them, by developing awareness of what they're saying to you, how they're behaving toward you, and how it's making you feel. For example, if they make a claim about you, such as \"you're never there for me,\" analyze the claim. Is it true? Can you think of examples that prove it wrong? Toxic people often exaggerate and make all-or-nothing claims. Practice thinking critically about what they say to you. Even if someone is toxic, that doesn't mean you'll always be right and they'll always be wrong. Own any mistakes you make and apologize when you feel it's appropriate. Even if they don't accept your apology or rarely apologize themselves, at least you will know you've done your best to be a good friend or partner. You might even make a positive impression on them. This is called modeling, or showing people healthier ways to behave than what they've traditionally done.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 30th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [30]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 29 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([29], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(30, \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([30], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Such a variety of application scenarios would ideally be served by a very expressive temporal conceptual data modelling language (TCDML) that would then be used throughout the various application scenarios for once-off effort of learning as well as easy reuse. Most extant TCDMLs, however, either lack transition constraints for object migration, temporal attributes, or relation migration (among others, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), and none of them has been evaluated by users on preferences for diagram notation with, importantly, temporal constraints, nor for understanding of a temporal model or ability to create a temporal conceptual data model. Here we include modellers in industry as \u2217Corresponding author. ORCID:  Email address:  (C. Maria Keet) Preprint submitted to An international Journal August 20, 2024             \fwell as undergraduate and postgraduate students in academia who have been taught conceptual modelling. Thus, there is, as a minimum, a need for an evaluation on fitness for purpose. In this paper, we aim to address this through the development of a TCDML that is grounded in the description logic language DLRUS and for which we designed and evaluated a graphical notation through a series of experiments. The resulting TCDML we called Trend, Temporal information Representation in ENtity-relationship Diagrams. In so doing, we sought to answer the following questions: RQ1: What diagram notation is preferred for temporal elements and constraints? RQ2: How well is the resulting temporal conceptual model understood by modellers? RQ3: How well are modellers able to design such models? To answer these questions, we conducted three sets of experiments. The first was a series of progressive experiments to determine the \u2018best\u2019, or most preferred, notation of temporal information among the plethora of notations, using a qualitative reflective learning approach with participants mainly from industry and a moderately-sized evaluation with postgraduate students. The second set of experiments focussed on model understanding and feedback on a few minor variants in notation for the transition constraint, among postgraduate students and a large cohort of undergraduate students. The third set of experiments zoomed in on the ability to design temporal conceptual models with a temporal conceptual data modelling language we designed, through varying the amount of explanation and the task to carry out, in three large-scale experiments with 200-450 participating students that are comparative novices in modelling, for increased statistical validity of the conclusions. The qualitative evaluations led to a \u2018tentative\u2019 notation for our TCDML, Trend, and also indicated a need for some training on modelling temporal information. The quantitative experiments finalised and solidified the Trend notation. The experiments revealed that the labels for the transition constraints have little impact on correctness, but a graphical notation is clearly preferred over controlled natural language text. Temporal entity types, attributes, and dynamic extension are best used. More extensive introductory notes did not assist substantially in modelling and understanding overall, although a marked increase in modelling in temporal attributes and relationships was observed. Better demarcation of the domain, in the form of a set of controlled natural language statements, did improve modelling quality of the temporal constraints. This paper extends our previously published work [6, 7] in a number of ways. While Trend was tested with a small number of participants in [7], here we summarise also the experiments leading up to that version and conduct large scale evaluations that also finalised the graphical notation. In addition, the preliminary Trend was only sketched in [7], whereas here we present the full language\u2014graphically, textually, and with its formal logic-based underpinning for precision and reference. We also provide an overview of the related work more comprehensively. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarises related work. Section 3 describes the first set of experiments and results to determine the preferred representation in extended ER diagrams. Section 4 and Appendix 7 introduce Trend and its formal foundation.

The output should consist of more than 35 sentences, with each sentence containing fewer than 32 tokens:\n\nYour parents might be worried that you'll be coming home too late if you are dating. Make sure to negotiate a reasonable curfew with them to ease their minds at the prospect of dating.  Don't bring up the conversation after you've come home late. You can say \u201cI'm going out, but my homework is done and I promise to be home by 9 p.m.\u201d If you've broken curfew in the past, the only way to build trust back is to stick to it in the future. One of the greatest fears for many parents is that their children will become physically intimate too early in life. Talk to your parents about what is acceptable under their rules in regards to kissing, holding hands, and sex. Assure them that you're responsible enough to make the right decisions, and ask them any questions you might have. Don't rely on TV, the internet, or friends for advice around this because the advice they give can often be inaccurate or misguided.  You can say \u201cI know you're worried about me getting physical with someone, but I'm way too young for that and I think it's gross. I just like this person and want to spend time with them.\u201d If you talk to your parents about physical boundaries and show that you agree with them, they may allow you to date. Don't just talk about sticking to the rules, make it a point to prove it to them through actions over time. If your parents think that dating someone will occupy too much of your time and take your focus off studies, then make sure to have an in depth conversation with them about setting limits. Stick to the limitations you set yourself by getting off the phone early, or only agreeing to go on one date a week. If your parents say \u201cI don't want you dating because it'll take too much time from your studies,\u201d respond by saying \u201cI have some free social time each week, and I'll make sure not to monopolize my time with this person. I just want to go out and have a good time, but my responsibilities and school is my top priority.\u201d  You can start by setting limits on how much you talk or socialize with your friends to prove to your parents that you can do it. Remember to discuss this with the person you're dating as well. Your parents may not like the idea of you being out late, and this could be a reason why they prevent you from dating. Instead of going on a date later in the night, try asking them if it's okay that you go to the park or museum during the day.   It's easier to go on daytime dates during the weekend, when you don't have school. Other daytime date ideas include the mall, a matinee, a hike, or a trip to a community garden. Going to a public place for your date is not only more fun, but it will ease parental concerns about intimacy between you and your date. If your parents are restricting you from dating because you'll be alone with the person, reassure them by telling them you're going to a public place and won't have time or space to be alone.   If your parents say \u201cI don't want you alone with them,\u201d you can respond by saying \u201cWe will be in a public place the entire time, and won't have to be alone in a room unsupervised. I'm just trying to have fun with this person, not be physical.\u201d Being alone with your date in their room or house unsupervised may bring up concerns about sex. A music concert, a play, or amusement park are a ton of fun and in public places. Hanging out with a bunch of friends doesn't seem as serious as an exclusive date, but you'll still have the opportunity to spend time with the person you like.  You can all go to the movies, a restaurant to eat, or to the bowling alley. Going out with friends you've made in the past will make your parents feel more comfortable. Although it may be tedious and embarrassing, this is a good way to compromise with your parents. Once they start letting you go on dates, you can have a conversation about limiting the texting.  Say \u201cI want to go on a date, but I promise to keep you informed and in the loop so you know everything is okay.\u201d The more that you go out without parental supervision, the more that they will trust that you can handle yourself. Some parents don't like the idea of their child in the car with an inexperienced driver. Other parents may not believe that you're telling the truth about your destination, so they will prevent you from catching a ride with your friend. A great way to get around this is to have them drive you and pick you up on the date.   Allowing your parents to drive you will ease their mind about where you're going, or what you're doing. If your parents can't or won't drive, ask them if it's okay for another parent to drive you.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 35 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 35}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.08510638297872342, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(1, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(2, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(4, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(5, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(6, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(7, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(8, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(9, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(10, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(11, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(12, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(13, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(14, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(15, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(16, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(17, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(18, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(19, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(20, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(21, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(22, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(23, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(24, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(25, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(26, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(27, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(28, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(29, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(30, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(31, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(32, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(33, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(34, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(35, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(36, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(37, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(38, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(39, \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check(40, \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}}}

Many years ago a girl opened her heart to me, she told me things she said she had never told another soul, she felt that she could trust me more so than any other person in her life. She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever. I heard it first, that magical laugh that always captivated me. I had to seek the source of the sound. Although many years had passed, I could remember it like it was yesterday and so many feelings came flooding back.  When I turned around I discovered it was her - it was really her! She was standing there a huge smile on her lips. It look me by surprise I never thought I would see her again and yet there was was standing before me. We talked for hours as though we had never been apart. To find out that she is moving back to our town, that she is single and still thinks of me as I had thought of her is almost a stroke of magic. I look forward to the years to come and hope they are just as magical as the very first day I laid eyes upon her.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.18181818181818182, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 18], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"unchange\")"]}}}

All pets require time, money, and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed. You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long-term.  Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so make sure you'll be home enough to take care of your pet. If you have kids, consider what pets will be kid-friendly. Hamsters and fish, for example, make great early pets. If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldn't consider a pet until you are more stable. Even different types of dogs have different needs, so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means. Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:   Dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.  Cats - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out.  Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.  Fish - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.  Lizards - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.  Birds - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.  Rabbits - Rabbits are friendly first-time pets that make a great contribution to the household. However, they can easily make a lot of noise and mess. It\u2019s a mistake to just decide \u201cI want a dog\u201d (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.  Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the \"herd,\" the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave. It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter. For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out. Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.  Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies. Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes. Don\u2019t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet. You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care. That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly. Curious, food-driven, and unable to listen to your warnings, pets can get into trouble if you don't create boundaries or safe spaces. Birds may dart out of open windows, lizards can scamper around the house, and dogs or cats may run into the street. Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach.  Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food. If you want your animal to have outside time, consider putting in a fence. Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's \"bedroom.\" Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other. Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things you'll need -- housing, toys, grooming supplies, etc. -- and shop before you bring your new pet home. Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page. If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by \"feeding\"  a doll or regularly watering plants.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 33 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.2222222222222222, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "for i in range(len(text.split('.'))):", "sentence = text.split('.')[i].strip()", "tools = [", "sentence_length_check(len(sentence.split()), \"more than\"),", "]"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detect()", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"]}}}

Keep the word 'have' unchanged and do not alter the second sentence:\n\nIf you would describe yourself as a girly girl, like to wear dresses and emphasize your feminine qualities, then you should keep doing that. But if you\u2019re more of a tomboy, then you should be proud to be who you are and not try to giggle more than usual, play with your hair more than usual, or just change who you are to be more girly because you think that\u2019s what guys want. The most important thing is that you act like yourself, and guys will be impressed. You can also mix it up. If you\u2019re more of a tomboy but want to put on a dress or a skirt once in a while, no one is stopping you. If you have a crush on a guy and have something to say to him about it, then make sure you do it yourself. Sure, it\u2019s easier and less stressful to have one of your friends talk to the guy for you to tell him what you\u2019re thinking, but if you do it yourself, you\u2019ll start an easier flow of communication and the guy will be impressed by your confidence. The worst that can happen is that he may not return your feelings, but at least you\u2019ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you had the courage to talk to him to begin with. If you\u2019re really shy about telling a guy you like him in person, you can pass him a note or talk to him online. The most important thing is that it\u2019s coming from you directly. Again, another misconception girls have about how to act around guys is that they want girls who are laughing all the time. Of course, if the guy you\u2019re around is genuinely funny, you can laugh all you want, but you should avoid laughing if you\u2019re doing it only because you think it\u2019ll make people like you more. You can laugh, but you should also have jokes of your own to share, too. You don\u2019t want people to think you\u2019re just a laugh track. When a guy is genuinely funny, you can crack up all you want. But you should avoid doing it just because you think it makes you look cute. You may also think that guys like girls who talk about how much money their purse cost, which celebrities are following them on Twitter, or other things that may superficially make you more interesting. Instead, talk about the things you actually care about, and guys will be impressed. If you do something that is worth bragging about, then the guys will find out some other way because other people will be praising you. Just work on being the best person you can be and guys will be impressed by what you do, whether you\u2019re amazing at learning foreign languages or have an unstoppable tennis serve. You may think that guys will think it\u2019s funny if you put other girls down or talk about the random drama you\u2019re experiencing. However, most guys actually prefer girls who are chill and who don\u2019t complain about their friends and who don\u2019t feel the need to put other people down just to feel better about themselves. If you actually say nice things about girls who aren\u2019t there and avoid gossip, guys will like you more because they\u2019ll see that you\u2019re easygoing and drama free and will be drawn to you. If you put down other girls, then it\u2019ll be a sign of your insecurity, and guys will see that you\u2019re only doing it to try to make yourself look better. Instead, praise other girls to show how comfortable you are with what you have to offer.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'have'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "have", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 2th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [2]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["detect_keyword(\"have\")", "detect_keyword(\"And you should not change who you are to be more girly because you think that's what guys want.\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"But if you\u2019re more of a tomboy, then you should be proud to be who you are and not try to giggle more than usual, play with your hair more than usual, or just change who you are to be more girly because you think that\u2019s what guys want.\", \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "keyword_detection_tool()", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"have\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) [15, 25, 20, 3, 6, 24, 33] have made great progress in solving grade-school [5] and even high-school level math problems [8] through chain-of-thought reasoning [28]. LLMs can also interact with proof assistants including Lean [18], Coq [26], or Isabelle [21] to prove theorems. However, the performance of theorem proving is not satisfying with LLMs [34]. One reason for this weakness is data sparsity. The mainstream approach for LLMs in learning theorem proving is through expert iteration[1, 30, 14, 22, 31]. LLMs search the proof in the given math problem and statement set like MiniF2F [34] and Mathlib [17] and learn from their success trajectories. However, the amount of data in MiniF2F is limited because formalizing problems requires significant labor from human experts. Though Mathlib is a very large dataset that contains the formalization of different math subjects in Lean, it mainly proves fundamental math theorems instead of contest-level problems. Therefore, an initial step toward a better automatic theorem-proving model is to create enough high-quality formalized statements. In this work, we present Lean Workbook: an iterative autoformalization pipeline, together with a large-scale Lean problem set. We train our autoformalization model based on active learning. \u2217Work done during internships at Shanghai AI Laboratory. Submitted to the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks. Do not distribute.             \fFigure 1: The data contribution of our Lean Workbook pipeline. Three rounds of filtering will mostly ensure the accuracy of output data. By applying the pipeline to the AOPS and the Compfiles data sources respectively, we derive 21 formalized IMO questions and about 57k synthetic training data for autoformalizaion. At each turn, we use our model to translate natural language problems into formal statements and back-translate to natural language problems collected from the math contest forum2. We use Lean compiler and Natural Language Inference (NLI) to check if it is a valid formalization. We sample invalid formalization and require human experts to modify them into a valid formalization and add them to the training set. Through the supplement of human-labeled data pairs, the translation model gradually learned to translate between Lean 4 formal language and natural language questions of different types of problems. We autoformalized 57K math problems in the final round. Manual examination reports an accuracy of 93.5% of a random sample of the Lean Workbook. The same filtering process produces 21 new formal statements of the IMO questions which do not appear in Compfiles 3. In conclusion, our contribution can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose an active learning pipeline for autoformalizing natural language questions. \u2022 We open-source our translation model and pipeline, which can be used for autoformalizing diverse topics of math statements. \u2022 We open-source a dataset containing 57k formalized math problems (5k of them have formal solutions) which can be used for autoformalization and auto theorem proving. \u2022 We formalize 21 new IMO questions that have not appeared in Compfiles.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 2th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [2]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 440 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 440}, "function_call": "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.28571428571428575, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(3200, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["word_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"solve\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"]}}}

The output should be under 30 sentences:\n\nAddition is generally a fairly simple concept, but it takes on special meaning when working with vectors. A single vector represents a movement, a force, or some other physical element acting upon an object. If there are two or more forces acting at the same time, you can \u201cadd\u201d these forces to find the resultant force acting on the object. For example, think of a golf ball that's hit into the air. One force acting on the ball is the force of the initial hit, and it consists of an angle and magnitude. Another force might be the wind, which has its own angle and magnitude. Adding these 2 forces can describe the resulting travel of the ball. Before you can add the vectors, you need to determine the components of each one. Using either of the processes described in this article, find the horizontal and vertical components of each force.  For example, suppose the golf ball is hit at a 30-degree angle upward with a speed of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h). Using trigonometry, the 2 component vectors are, therefore:  Vertical=130sin\u2061(30)=65mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=130\\sin(30)=65{\\text{mph}}} Horizontal=130cos\u2061(30)=112.6mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=130\\cos(30)=112.6{\\text{mph}}}   Then consider the vector that represents the force of the wind. Suppose the wind is blowing the ball downward at an angle of 10 degrees, at speed of 10\u00a0mph (16.1\u00a0km/h). (We are ignoring left and right forces for simplicity of calculation). The wind\u2019s two components can be calculated similarly:  Vertical=10sin\u2061(\u221210)=\u22121.74mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=10\\sin(-10)=-1.74{\\text{mph}}} Horizontal=10cos\u2061(\u221210)=9.85mph{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=10\\cos(-10)=9.85{\\text{mph}}} Notice that we use an angle of -10 degrees because the wind is blowing down, acting against the force of the hit. Because the component vectors are always measured at right angles, you can add them directly. Pay attention matching the horizontal component of 1 vector to the horizontal component of the other, and the same for the vertical components.  For this sample, the resultant vertical vector is the sum of the two components:  Vertical=65+(\u22121.74)=63.26{\\displaystyle {\\text{Vertical}}=65+(-1.74)=63.26} Horizontal=112.6+9.85=122.45{\\displaystyle {\\text{Horizontal}}=112.6+9.85=122.45}   Interpret the meaning of these results. The net force acting on the golf ball, due to both the hit and the wind, is the equivalent of a single force with components of 63.26\u00a0mph (101.81\u00a0km/h) vertically and 122.45 miles per hour horizontally. Ultimately, what you would like to know is the net effect of both the golf swing and the wind, acting together on the ball. If you know the two components, you can put them together with the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.  Recall that the component vectors represent the legs of a right triangle. The resultant vector is the hypotenuse of that right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, c2=a2+b2{\\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}}, you can calculate this as follows:  Resultant2=63.262+122.452{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}^{2}=63.26^{2}+122.45^{2}} Resultant2=18,995.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}^{2}=18,995.83} Resultant=18,995.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}={\\sqrt {18,995.83}}} Resultant=137.83{\\displaystyle {\\text{Resultant}}=137.83}   Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force on the ball with a magnitude of 137.83\u00a0mph (221.82\u00a0km/h). Notice that this is slightly higher than the force of the initial hit, because the wind is pushing the ball forward at the same time that it pushes it down. Knowing the force of the resultant vector is half of the solution. The other half is to find the net angle of the resultant vector. In this example, because the golf swing applies an upward force and the wind applies a downward, though lesser, force, you need to find the resulting angle.  Sketch a right triangle and label the component parts. The horizontal base of the triangle represents the forward vector component of 122.45. The vertical leg represents the upward vector component of 63.26. The hypotenuse represents the resultant vector with a magnitude of 137.83. You can choose either the sine function, with the vertical component, or the cosine function, with the horizontal component, to find the angle. The result will be the same.  sin\u2061\u03b8=63.26137.83{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta ={\\frac {63.26}{137.83}}} sin\u2061\u03b8=0.459{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta =0.459} \u03b8=arcsin\u2061(0.459){\\displaystyle \\theta =\\arcsin(0.459)} \u03b8=27.32{\\displaystyle \\theta =27.32}   Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force acting on the ball at an upward angle of 27.32 degrees. This makes sense, as it's slightly lower than the swing's angle, at 30 degrees, due to the downward force of the wind. However, the golf swing is a much stronger force than the wind in this example, so the angle is still close to 30. To report the resultant vector, give both its angle and magnitude. In the golf ball example, the resultant vector has a magnitude of 137.83\u00a0mph (221.82\u00a0km/h), at an angle of 27.32 degrees above the horizontal.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'half'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "half", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"half\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"]}}}

First, I had to go a health science statistics class to deliver a presentation.  The presentation was a group project where we analyzed Wingate Test data.  I had done most of the project myself because I did not fully trust my group member, so I was quite nervous. Despite the problem, we did quite well, and it was reflected by the grade that we received later on.  However, at the time, I just knew that we stumbled a bit.  I then went on to a different building where I began to study for the more challenging task of the day - an anatomy practical and exam.  I had been studying ALL over the past week, which a much heavier emphasis on the prior weekend for these.  I needed a good grade here to maintain my 4.0 average (whereas my grade in my stats class was relatively safe).  I studied in this building from approximately 9:45 AM to just shy of 12:30 PM.  At this point, I headed up to the floor where my exams were and changed clothes (scrubs are a must in the anatomy lab).    After changing clothes, I went to the hallway just outside of the lab where classmates were starting to gather.  I sat down and studied just a bit more before the professors arrived.  Unfortunately, I did not make it into the first group of test takers (the practical only had around 10 stations and there were 16 students, so we had to be be split up).  This meant that I had to hang out in the hallway for a bit longer while the first group took exams.  While there, I studied and had a conversation with a girl about our dogs (we both have a dog named Darwin).  Finally, it was time for me to start the practical.  I went in, and had some uncertainties about a few of the stations that made me feel pretty miserable - I was certain that I was going to lose my A.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam, where I was able to brood some more about my performance on the practical.  As I struggled through the exam (it was the hardest one yet), I just knew one thing - I was tired.  As I finished (with only one other student in the room), I slowly got up, walked to the teachers and turn in my exam before I left towards my car.  I had decided that I was going to to go to the store and get some wine.  On the way, I checked my phone and much to my surprise - they had already graded and posted to grades for the practical.

To deploy a natural language task, such as translation and text classi\ufb01cation, researchers \ufb01rst pre-train a model to embed words into vectors using ELMo [19], GPT [17], and BERT [6]. These pre-trained models are initially trained on a large unsupervised text corpus and then \ufb01ne-tuned on different downstream tasks. Such models are called large language models (LLMs) due to their relatively large number of model parameters. These LLMs have been deployed to the source code to learn program representations. Similar to natural language, the program representation learned from the source code using pre-trained models can be applied to several downstream program analysis tasks. In 2020, Feng et al. proposed a pre-trained model called CodeBERT [7], based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), that learns general-purpose representations to support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural language code search, code documentation generation, and more. In 2021, Guo et al. proposed a new pretrained model, GraphCodeBERT [8], which improves CodeBERT by enabling the model to capture more program semantic information, such as data \ufb02ow. Recently, researchers have adopted ChatGPT for various code analysis tasks, such as code re\ufb01nement [9], vulnerability discovery [4], and more. In industry, GitHub Copilot [2], powered by GPT, assists developers by suggesting code snippets, completing functions, and providing contextual code recommendations directly within Integrated Development Environments. The difference between natural language and programming language leads to unintended consequences if these NLP models are directly applied to programming language. In natural language, the meaning of a word is deterministic in a speci\ufb01c context, whereas in programming language, a programmer can assign any string to any variable, method, or function as their names. In such cases, most strings in the code could be replaced by other words and may not carry meaningful information. If a large language model still heavily relies on the literal meaning of a variable, method, or function name, it may encounter problems when the assigned name does not contain useful information or has a controversial meaning. Furthermore, a limited number of words are used in natural language, while in programming language, the number of words can be unlimited because a programmer can casually create a string to name a variable, regardless of whether the created string is interpretable. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the word embedding adopted in natural language is still ef\ufb01cient for solving program analysis tasks. If a model designer ignores the numerous differences between natural language and programming language and naively adopts methods from NLP, the designed model may suffer from the above limitations. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy that groups features in programming languages into two categories: literal features and logical features. We aim to investigate how these different types of features affect the performance of current pre-trained models in downstream tasks and to what extent they in\ufb02uence the results. Speci\ufb01cally, to achieve this goal, we create eight types of datasets that mask off different types of features to quantitatively measure their impact. In each dataset, either variable names or method/function names are replaced with nonsense or misleading names. We then use well-trained models (CodeBERT) to perform two code analysis tasks on these created datasets and measure the impact of naming on the model\u2019s performance. Based on the experimental results, we \ufb01nd that naming strategies have a signi\ufb01cant impact on the performance of code analysis tasks based on LLMs, indicating that code representation learning heavily relies on well-de\ufb01ned names in code. Our experiments with CodeBERT reveal the extent to which literal and logical features impact performance. While these models exhibit remarkable capabilities, their effectiveness can be in\ufb02uenced by unreliable features in the analyzed code. Instances such as code generated from decompilation [12]             \for non-conventional code naming [3] might yield reduced accuracy, as LLMs\u2019 generalization ability is limited to the patterns and examples present in their training data. Additionally, since ChatGPT is a conversational large language model that can provide intuitive feedback, we conduct a case study to investigate the pre-trained model\u2019s ability to comprehend programming language in speci\ufb01c settings.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

Although my older son was in school the past two years, part time and then a full day, I always had my youngest with me. I can't remember the last time I was consistently alone, well I can but it was about five years ago.  Their dad works full time and is almost never home, and never does anything related to school activities. The first day was crazy for me. I drove to my oldest son's school and got him settled with her and made sure he was comfortable and confident starting Kindergarten. I hightailed in out of there back to the car and got my youngest back in his seat and booked it to his school. Of course we live in a ridiculous town which hasn't done construction work all summer, yet they chose the first day of school to close down the roads surrounding two of our biggest schools. I was already rushing because my sons are supposed to be at their school 5 minutes apart and that's not even humanly possible, although I'll still always try. Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting and straight losing their shit because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school. My son just stood in line and walked out with his class and as he leaves he turns around and goes, you're going to come back right? What of course I'm going to come back I'll be here when the day ends to pick you up and then we'll go get your brother from his school and then get home. He walked out with his class and I left the building. All these other parents were crying and visibly upset about leaving their kids at school, I literally walked out the door, stood still for a moment and took a deep breath. I finally was alone, and it was going to happen again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. I felt guilty all the other moms were looking at me like I'm a lunatic because I'm relieved and not bawling my eyes out. But honestly to each their own, and if they had my kids instead of theirs I can tell you they'd be the one breathing a sigh of relief.

I have always lived my life with the question bearing down like a heavy weight: What do I want? How shall I spend my day? Too much freedom is a heavy burden.    Even though I love to sleep, and in the last month I haven't done all that much of it, I have never felt so free. Maybe it would feel different if there were a man around. I am sleep deprived and I should feel overwhelmed, but I guess I don't have time. I mean, this is the first time I have written since the Blessed Event:     I had just finished my work for Maternity Leave (  3 whole months! )I knew all day I felt different, but honestly thought it might have been the Mexican I'd eaten at lunch. But it was a crazy coincidence that after I went to my neighborhood pool after work, swimming in the slow lane, next to a duck of all things (?) I got out of the pool and felt my water break. Like a cork pulled from a bottle of fizzy champagne. ( People have since asked how I knew. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them \"There is no mistaking a bottle of champagne uncorking between ones legs!\") I got right home, waddling like said Duck from the slow lane. Two slow blocks. I have been living with my Dad and Step-Mother, as you know Diary, and my Dad recalled my Mom's LABORS TO BE FAST, so he ignored my mid-wives reccommendation to call her when the contractions started coming closer together than they were ( 5 minutes, but what did I know? Could be Braxtons I thought. Like the Mexican Food, life can send the wrong message from brain to body, I figured.)     Good thing we listened to the old man, it was 8 hours from start to finish, but it felt like a lot less. Memory blocks pain, I am told, so that's where all those lost minutes that add up to 7 hours went.   By 1:26 A.M. I had a boy. I pushed for an hour, the hour that changed me into a mom more than anything. I now believe I can do anything I have to. And afterwards they handed me this tiny red-headed chicken, and for the first time in my life I knew what it was like to love someone more than myself.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 18 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 18th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [18]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.25, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18], \"change\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"]}}}

So the day came, I went and awaited while really feeling the anxiety and the feeling of being ill were not nice at all during those long hours that I had to wait to finally get my turn with the doctor. The consultation was normal, except for the last part when the internist told me he was worried about certain findings during the physical exam and the interrogation so he asked me to go to certain laboratory and do like 3 exams, so did I. I returned to the doctor's office and he gave me the diagnosis, testicular cancer. I could not believe what was happening at the moment, I got frustasted even though all the things that the doctor was explaining to me made sense and actually explained why I was feeling like that but it is not easy to accept this kind of news right away, it is just a hard pill to swallow. However I found certain strenght in me, I asked the doctor: \"what is the next step?\". He promptly answered me he will referred me to a specialist which he will guide in the following steps, that I should not lost any hope because my cancer was at the early stages so my chances were high to survive it. I immediatly went to the specialist's office and he examined me and he started talking about my case, he was making sure that I fully understood everything he was telling during our first consultation because it was key to start the treatment process. Then he gave me the steps to follow, what kind of diet should I have, what medicine will I be taking from now on and how regularly should I be coming to follow my case. The final outcome of this initial phase was preparing me to surgery because my situation was hopeful given the early detection. I followed the instructions given me to letter by letter because in my mind I was sure that I would not give up on living and being with my family. Weeks were passing by and I was starting to feel better, even though, I had to admit when I started taking the medication it was kind of hard getting used to this meds because they are really strong nothing like the usual stuff you would be taking for a cold. The last follow-up with the specialist was decisive, he gave priority and we set up the date for the surgery. I got home and it suddenly realized how big that day would be, it would mark a difference in my life. The date was getting closer and the anxiety was getting higher however I would not give up. The date came and the surgery was performed, everything went great. After a few days the specialist did a scan where there was not hints of cancer and I finally recover my opportunity to keep fighting in life.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"really\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"bad\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"cancer\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 16 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"I\", 20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"more than\")"]}}}

Automatic sign language processing has recently received growing interest in the computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) communities. Yin et al. (2021) make several recommendations for the study of sign languages in NLP research, including greater emphasis on real-world data. Most studies on sign language are based on data collected in a controlled environment, either Diane Brentari Univeristy of Chicago Karen Livescu TTI-Chicago in a studio setting (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2017) or in a speci\ufb01c domain (Forster et al., 2016). The challenges involved in real-world signing videos, including various visual conditions and different levels of \ufb02uency in signing, are not fully re\ufb02ected in such datasets. Automatic processing of sign language videos \"in the wild\" has not been addressed until recently, and is still restricted to tasks like isolated sign recognition (Albanie et al., 2020; Joze and Koller, 2019; Li et al., 2020) and \ufb01ngerspelling recognition (Shi et al., 2018, 2019). In this work we take a step further and study search and retrieval of arbitrary \ufb01ngerspelled content in real-world American Sign Language (ASL) video (see Figure 1). (a) \ufb01ngerspelled Figure 1: Our two search tasks: word search (FWS) for determining which words are \ufb01ngerspelled in a sign language video clip, and (b) \ufb01ngerspelling video search (FVS) for searching for sign language videos that include a \ufb01ngerspelled query word/phrase. The sign language videos are untrimmed, i.e. they include regular signs in addition to \ufb01ngerspelling, and are downsampled here for visualization. 1From  Fingerspelling is a component of sign language COVIDVACCINETAXCLIMATEASL VLOGSign Language Video QueryWord(EN) ListQuery Word(EN):Sign Language Video List......(a) FWS(b) FVS            \fin which words are signed by a series of handshapes or movements corresponding to single letters (see the Appendix for the ASL \ufb01ngerspelling alphabet). Fingerspelling is used mainly for lexical items that do not have their own signs, such as proper nouns or technical terms, and has an important place in sign language. For example, \ufb01ngerspelling accounts for 12-35% of ASL (Padden and Gunsauls, 2003). Since important content like named entities is often \ufb01ngerspelled, the \ufb01ngerspelled portions of a sign language video often carry a disproportionate amount of the content. Most prior work on \ufb01ngerspelling has focused on recognition (Shi et al., 2018, 2019), that is, transcription of a \ufb01ngerspelling video clip into text. However, automatic recognition assumes that the boundaries of \ufb01ngerspelled segments are known at test time, and may not be the end goal in real-world use cases. In addition, complete transcription may not be necessary to extract the needed information. Fingerspelling search, such as retrieving sign language videos based on a query word, is a more practical task, and is an important component of general video search involving sign language. In addition to introducing the task, we address the research question of whether the explicit temporal localization of \ufb01ngerspelling can help its search and retrieval, and how best to localize it. As \ufb01ngerspelling occurs sparsely in the signing stream, explicit detection of \ufb01ngerspelling could potentially improve search performance by removing unrelated signs. To this end, we propose an end-to-end model, FSS-Net, which jointly detects \ufb01ngerspelling from unconstrained signing video and matches it to text queries. Our approach consistently outperforms a series of baselines without explicit detection and a baseline with an off-theshelf \ufb01ngerspelling detector by a large margin.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "base": ["detect_keyword()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"sign language\", 10, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"]}}}

For instance, the emerging information retrieval paradigm of conversational search frames information-seeking processes within multiturn dialogue interactions. Conversational search facilitates exploring and progressively narrowing the search scope to relevant knowledge items within an information space. These search-oriented conversational interfaces are often connected to structured data sources like knowledge graphs. However, a key challenge lies in mediating between natural language, in which users express their queries, and machine-readable knowledge representations. The task of data-to-text generation focuses on this issue, taking structured data as input to produce coherent, human-readable text, which has been extensively studied with approaches ranging from rule-based to supervised neural networkbased techniques. Over the last years, the field of NLP has witnessed a shift in methodologies with the advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches that rely on annotated datasets, LLMs are trained in a self-supervised manner, predicting tokens within vast amounts of unlabeled data. Combined with scaling up the model size and training corpora, this approach has demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities of LLMs and their prowess in multitask learning (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). An advantage of LLMs lies in prompt-based (in-context) learning. Through carefully defined prompts, these foundation models can perform multiple tasks like question-answering, semantic parsing, or text summarization (Liu et al., 2023). More recently, there has been a growing interest in optimizing LLMs for conversational interactions by pre-training on dialogue corpora, instruction finetuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (Thoppilan et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022). Although LLMs offer tremendous potential for conversational interaction, owing to their ability to produce responses for arbitrary input, they have known limitations, such as the risk of hallucinating or omitting important information and a lack of transparency regarding the origins of information sources from which they derive their outputs (Dou et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023). In order to mitigate these limitations, it becomes imperative to ground their generated outputs in verifiable factual data from knowledge graphs. However, there has been insufficient systematic investigation into their pro22 b e F ] L C . s c [ v91.02 : v i X r a             \fficiency in verbalizing graph-structured data input. To assess LLMs in knowledge-based text generation, we compare four models of different sizes and training objectives, with a primary focus on models optimized for conversational interaction. Based on the popular WebNLG benchmark dataset, we evaluate the models\u2019 performance in generating natural language text from semantic triples. Through multiple experiments, we analyze different configurations of models and prompting techniques, discussing insights about their individual capabilities and limitations. Our contributions include: (1) adapting the WebNLG benchmark to evaluate closed- and open-source LLMs, (2) providing a thorough error analysis and insights on model performance with automatic reference-based metrics as well as human evaluation, and (3) creating a new fine-tuning dataset with 26,422 conversations with triple-to-text verbalizations in chat completion format.

Do you want to go out to a special dinner with your parents? Think about what you want from the conversation. It can even help to write it down. Make sure you have all the important details. Having details will help you answer questions. Answering questions will calm your parents down. For instance, if you want to spend the night at friend's house, you'll need to know if her parents will be there, when the night will start, what you'll need to bring, and when your parents can pick you up. It also might help to have a phone number for your friend's parents. That way, your parents can call her parents. You don't want to talk when your parents are busy. Pick a time when they have a moment to sit down with you. It should be a time when you can have their full attention. If you can't figure out a time, ask your parents when a good time would be. If you keep trying to draw it out, you're just going to get more nervous. As soon as you get your parents together, just begin what you have to say.  For instance, you could start by saying, \"I have something I want to discuss with you, and I hope you will keep an open mind. I'd like to go to the dance this Saturday night.\" If you absolutely can't get it out right away, it's okay to start the conversation with something else, as long as you get to the point eventually. A good way to convince someone to do something is to tell the person what good it will do them.Think about how your parents will benefit from what you are doing, and bring that up.  As an example, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out for a night, you could say, \"As an added bonus, you'd get the house all to yourself!\" Another example is if you're trying to get your parents to eat out somewhere, mention their favorite dishes. If you try to lie or give a half truth, your parents may not trust you in the future if they find out. Plus, they know you pretty well, so they can probably tell when you're lying. That is, you might have a tendency to blame your parents. Most people do in serious conversations. However, you should try to stick to what you're feeling or thinking, not what you blame your parents for. In other words, use \"I\" instead of \"you.\" Say, \"I feel upset when I can't go out when my friends do,\" not \"You're awful for not letting me go out with my friends.\" The second one puts your parents on their guard, while the first one just expresses what you're feeling. If you can, have details to back up what you say. As noted in the previous section, having details about where you're going is important. But it's equally important to have details in other conversations, too. Having someone with more authority than you, such as one of your friend's parents, a teacher, or a researcher through an article, to back you up can help persuade your parents. For instance, if you're trying to convince your parents that you should be in the band, you could have research articles stating how music can help you do better in math. You could say, \"As this research shows, being in band can help me do better in math. I'll let you have these pages so you can read up on it.\" If you are trying to get your parents to do something they don't want to do, then hearing why may help you. Your parents may have good points to bring up about the problem. In turn, you may be able to deal with those problems by finding solutions. It's important that you approach your parents politely. Getting angry or upset will not help you convince them of anything. In fact, it makes you seem immature.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Every year when the tickets for the convention go on sale we buy them and then just sort of forget about them for a while. Then a month before we get the AirBnB and a month after that we are sitting outside my friends house waiting for him to shower so we can start the long drive to dallas. After the 8 hour grueling trip with the obligatory stop at bucees we are there and looking forward to a good time. The line that we stood in felt like a mile long and we were definitely waiting for around an hour to an hour and a half to get inside but that was the only line for the weekend so not to bad. Inside though the culture is always great, just tons of love for video games and people and just everyone looking around having a good time buying things and relaxing. The air bnb was great also as we all just got to relax in a nice house in the suburbs and play games and talk. A friend of mine had bought a card game that doubled as a drinking game that day so we played that. It was a lot of fun everyone just sharing things laughing and overall just getting piss drunk. When everyone had deicded they had enough that night we called it quits and slept. The next day i woke up and wondered where everyone was and found a friend of mine awake. He figured they already went to the convention center so he and i walked to a dennys for breakfast. The meal was good and fun and from there we met everyone at the convention center. Was a great full day of hanging out explorering listening to panels then we headed back home for the night. We found out it was my friends birthday that weekend so we got him a cake and sang for him that night. The next day was our last day in dallas so we decided to just hang out again have some great food and visit spots around the city. We were dreading the long drive home but at the same time looking forward to the stop at buccees again.

Information retrieved using machine learning from financial reports, news or posts in social media can be used as indicators of companies\u2019 performance or as insights of a market. Many industry actors are interested in extracting this information to use it as a resource that can provide them \u2217Corresponding author. with a competitive advantage, such as firms forecasting internal future benefits and losses, investors extracting differential information for trading purposes or any practitioner interested in tracking financial assets. Nevertheless, some characteristics of financial text make these tasks especially challenging for models that have been trained on general domain data. The use of specific terminology along with the high complexity of the documents, leads these generalist language models to underperform on financial tasks, which suggests that domain adaptation might be required to improve accuracy of interpretation and analysis. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and their proven capabilities for NLP tasks has made them stand out and become an interesting option to study. Due to the fact that even the best general language models fall short for some financial tasks, some proposals have been recently presented for a financial domain adaptation of LLMs. These models tailored for finance, such as BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023), have been introduced as multitasking generative models specifically designed for financial text understanding and generation. However, these fine-tuned models still show room for improvement, both in performance and in the efficiency of the proposed training strategies. This paper tackles various aspects of adapting LLMs to the financial domain. In particular, we explore diverse strategies of domain adaptation and fine-tuning of LLMs for financial sentiment analysis, and conduct a series of experiments over two different foundation models. The study focuses particularly on smaller manageable models, up to 1.5B parameters, in order to explore the possibilities of models that can be accessible with relatively low hardware requirements. Although the adapted models are smaller than the current state-of-the-art ones, results show that they achieve similar or higher performance. In addition, a curated data collection 22 n a J 2 ] L C . s c [ v74.02 : v i X r a             \fwith two main datasets is also presented. One constructed with financial documents and reports, and the other a set of instructions for financial tasks. We show, step by step, the process of creating these datasets and particularly focus on the use of more powerful LLMs to generate synthetic instructions to fine-tune smaller LLMs. Finally, apart from the main focus of the study which is on financial sentiment analysis, other tasks have also been evaluated to analyze the multitasking capabilities of our models.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 15 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"]}}}

Help them to read these whole stories by encouraging explicit phonics use, and recognizing vocabulary. As their word recognition increases, they\u2019ll be able to more fully understand story plots and meanings. Allow your child to look at the pictures - it doesn\u2019t count as cheating if they do. Image and word association is a helpful aspect of building vocabulary. After every reading session, have your child describe what the story was about to you. Try to get them to be detailed, but don\u2019t expect an elaborate response. An easy and fun way to help encourage this is to use puppets who represent characters in the story, so your child can describe it to you through them. Similar to when you were reading stories to your child, every time your child reads ask them questions about what they\u2019ve just read. At first it will be difficult for them to think critically about meanings of words and the buildup of character development and plot (or the semblance of those things in the most basic of stories), but over time they will develop the necessary skills to answer questions.  Make a questions list that your child can read; their ability to read and understand the provided questions is nearly as helpful as answering the questions themselves. Start with direct questions, such as \u2018who was the main character in the book?,\u2019 instead of more abstract questions like \u2018why was the main character upset?\u2019 Reading is a necessary precursor to writing, but as your child develops reading skills have them practice their writing in conjunction. Children learn to read faster and easier if they learn to write at the same time. The motor memory of the letters, listening to their sounds and seeing them in writing will reinforce new learning. So, teach your child to write letters and words. You\u2019ll notice an enhanced reading ability as your child learns to spell by decoding and sounding out words. Work slowly though, and don\u2019t expect perfection. Just as you taught your child the joy of reading before they knew how, you should continue to promote reading by reading to/with them on a daily basis. They\u2019ll develop a stronger phonemic awareness when they can see words as you read them, rather than struggling to do both at the same time themselves. You\u2019ll be given a better idea of your child\u2019s reading ability when they read out loud, and they\u2019ll be forced to slow down their reading to correctly sound out words. Avoid stopping your child to correct them while reading though, as doing so can interrupt their train of thought and make comprehending what they\u2019re reading more difficult. Reading out loud doesn\u2019t have to be limited to stories; whenever you are around words, have your child sound them out to you. Road signs are a great example of something your child sees on a daily basis, and can practice reading out loud to you.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(count=26, relation=\"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(length=19, relation=\"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should contain more than seven tokens:\n\nAfter a few weeks of keeping track of everything you eat and drink, you'll probably see some patterns emerge. Some patterns will be obvious, like having the same thing for breakfast every day, while others will be a bit more enlightening. Check your diary and think about these questions:  Are there patterns related to how foods affect your mood? Which meals seem to leave you hungry, and which are more satisfying? In what situations do you tend to overeat? Many people are surprised at how many snacks they consume in a given day. A handful of almonds here, a cookie or two there, and a bag of chips, while you watch TV at night, can add up in the end. Use your diary to assess whether your snacking habits are healthy or might need a little work.  Do you tend to choose healthy snacks, or grab whatever's nearby? If you tend to be on-the-go and don't have time to prepare fresh food every time you need a snack, try thinking ahead and bringing snacks along with you instead of heading for snack machines when you're hungry. Do your snacks leave you satisfied or do they just make you hungrier? Review any notes on how you feel after your snacks to analyze whether or not your snacks should change. For most people, work and school have a big effect on their eating habits. You might find it hard to make time for cooking on workdays, but spend more time in the kitchen on your days off. See if you can find patterns that might influence your eating habits.  Do you tend to eat out more on certain days? If you notice that you get takeout four times a week because you work late, that might signify you should do meal prep on the weekends to help support healthier meals during the week. Use the information to help you plan out your meals. If you know you're not going to feel like cooking on a certain night, try planning to have something healthy in the refrigerator. Figure out what life situations might have influenced your eating for any given day or week. You might notice a pattern in the food choices you make during times that are stressful, lonely, or when you're bored. Maybe you can't sleep well so you eat a midnight snack, or you turn to comfort foods after a stressful workday. Knowing this about yourself can be useful when it comes to planning out your diet.  See if there's an issue with overeating when you're upset. If so, try engaging in other more relaxing activities instead of turning to food when you're stressed. On the flip side, if certain foods seem responsible for negative emotions, you might want to try giving them up to see what happens. For example, you may feel anxious and jittery after drinking too much coffee. Look for patterns in the way foods impact your body. You might notice that you have lactose intolerance when your notes continually show nausea, upset stomach and bloating after you eat dairy-rich foods.  See what foods make you feel bloated, gassy, have a headache, nauseous, or just generally too full.  Keep these notes to share with a doctor or registered dietitian.  Celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and other illnesses can be greatly helped by altering your diet to eliminate certain ingredients. If you have symptoms that lead you to believe food might be making your problems worse, bring your food diary to the doctor to discuss the possibility that changing your diet could help.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.6, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666665}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"equal\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"]}}}

I've been working with a Blue-headed macaw for that past 4 months, hand raising him since he was only 5 weeks old.  He was the first BH Macaw we were ever able to hatch at my facility so he got some special treatment when he got into human care.  This little guy had free range of the building once he began flying.  It go to the point where we had to put him in the kitchen since he would get himself in to some pretty high up spots where we couldn't reach him.  So after Azul began flying, we decided it was time to start training him.  Let's just say that at the beginning he was not a fan of his restricted time.  In order to work with him we needed him first to learn to step up onto our hand on cue.  So he didn't get the spoiled treatment of being allowed to fly when he wanted in our kitchen.  The first few days, he would try to bite our hands when ever we put it near him.  So Azul would then get to fly around without stepping on our hand first, as we'd pull our hand out of the cage and he'd take that opportunity to gain his freedom.  Eventually though through mostly my effort, and a little diet modification, I got Azul to accept my hand being near his perch without him biting me.  Then I began to teach him how to lift up his foot so he can signal to us he is interested in coming out.  Every a few more days of this work he finally began to put a foot on my hand, not without trying to bite me right after, but baby steps.  After we got over this phase of biting, we reached the point when he would place his feet on my hand and receive a nice little treat for doing that.  Then he got his chance to fly around the kitchen in all its freedom for a few hours until we needed him to go back.  With lots of hard work Azul learned that he could get what he wanted by stepping out nicely and not trying to knaw on the hand that feeds him.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([6, 9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

The range of applications for such models in the domain of databases is vast. It ranges from novel interfaces [11, 12, 32, 59, 69, 83, 88] to new system architectures [77, 84], based on data representations and processing mechanisms that are enabled by the latest generation of language models. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce database researchers to the possibilities offered by these models, to provide pointers to libraries and APIs that make them accessible [60, 97], and to review recent research in the database community exploiting them. The tutorial will cover language models that process and generate natural language text [15, 18], as well as more recent models that generate program code from natural language descriptions [9]. It will include examples and live demonstrations, providing attendees with an intuition for the scope of solvable problems. The tutorial is aimed at database researchers. No prior background in language models or NLP is expected. The tutorial will start with a short, high-level introduction to the Transformer [89], a novel neural network architecture that has has enabled many of the recent advances in NLP. Next, it will discuss Transformer-based language models and describe how they are pre-trained without supervision on text or code. For model sizes in the hundreds of millions of parameters [15, 45, 52, 63], pre-training is typically followed by another (short) training phase on task-specific samples (\u201cfine-tuning\u201d). Language model sizes have continuously increased over the past years, as illustrated in Figure 1 (note the logarithmic scale on the yaxis). The latest generation of language models with sizes in the hundreds of billions of parameters [9, 13, 17, 18, 27, 50, 64, 65, 73, 76, 103] can often be used without further specialization (\u201cprompting\u201d). The tutorial will discuss and demonstrate both methods. Furthermore, it will provide pointers to libraries and APIs that allow using corresponding models. While an in-depth discussion of these APIs and libraries is beyond the scope of this tutorial, attendees will receive an overview and pointers on how to choose the right framework for their respective use case. Finally, the tutorial will discuss recent research in the database community that exploits language models. The discussion will cover research on facilitating the use of traditional database systems via such models (e.g., by advanced user interfaces [71, 75]). Also, it will include research that exploits language models to revise fundamental design decisions in database systems [26, 77, 84]. The total duration of the tutorial is 1.5 hours, including questions and discussions. The reminder of this proposal is organized as follows.

He had saved up some money but he spent it on Christmas presents for his family and friends. He had been working part time for a warehouse near his house but it was closed for the season and he had been out of work for a few weeks. He had tried calling his CTE worker but he couldn't get a hold of them. He went to the bus station to get a ticket to go to where his sister lives, but the ticket was too expensive.  He had no family or friends in the immediate area, so he didn't know what to do. I had worked with him a little bit at the warehouse and he seemed like a nice enough person. I had given him a ride home from work a few times over the past few months. I gave him my phone number, so in case he needed a ride. He kept my number and gave me a call. he let me know what his situation was and that he was not sure what he should do. I told him I would drive down there to see him. When I got there he was just sitting on a bench in front of the station with his head hung low. I greeted him and he looked up at me. I asked what was going on and he said he had nowhere to go and no money so he was scared and worried that he would have to sleep out in the cold that night. I looked in my wallet and had ten dollars  in there, which I knew would get him a night at the local shelter a few miles away. I told him I could pay to get him into the shelter tonight. I told him I'd give him a ride down there so he wouldn't have to walk in the cold. He smiled and thanked me for my help. When we got to the shelter, I told him to give me a cll in the morning and I would see if I could find him some part-time work at the farm I worked on so he could try to get money for a bus ticket or somewhere more permanent to stay. He started crying and thanked me and gave me a big hug.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 360}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")"]}}}

At first I thought he was everything that I always wanted in a man. Not only did he work a full time job but he also helped around the house, treated me and my daughter like royalty, and was faithful. He had mentioned numerous times throughout our relationship that he had a rough past, but never did either of us imagine that it would catch up to him like it did in the most embarrassing way possible. One weekend, me, Brian, and my daughter Diamond were all eating breakfast when suddenly there was a loud banging on the door. \"Open up this is the police!\" a man cried.This startled me, but Brian seemed unfazed as he quickly and quietly got up from the table and started to make his way towards the bedroom. I asked him where he was going but he wouldn't tell me. All he said was to act like he had been missing for days to save myself. I watched in horror as opened the window and climbed out without uttering another word as the police continued to knock. \"Hold on, I'm coming!\" I said, closing the window and leaving the bedroom to walk to the main door. My daughter was in tears. \"Where did Brian go?\" she wailed. I shushed her, composed myself, and opened the door. As soon as I did, five police officers swarmed in and they went about raiding my entire apartment. \"Excuse me. What is going on?\" I said. One of the police officers told me that they were looking for my boyfriend as apparently he had murdered his father. I did my best to remain calm. \"He asked if I had seen him around lately. I lied and told him no and that it had been a few days. \"He's not here so please leave, you all are scaring my daughter.\" After they'd finished searching, the police all gathered around in my living room. They asked me more questions about Brian and then they left, saying that they'd let me know when they found him. I remember crying for hours after the'd left and wondering things went so wrong so fast? Days later, I received a call that they did find Brian in another state and he was in police custody. He's now sitting in jail where he'll remain for 30 years without parole for manslaughter of his father William DeFranco.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"]}}}

Despite these successes, our understanding of how these models internally process and represent information remains limited [13; 24]. Previous studies have demonstrated that internal model representations can reveal how models plan ahead in text generation. By intervening on neural activations\u2014specifically by patching them between different locations at inference time - we can uncover existing causal relationships [29; 26; 21; 19; 7]. For instance, Pal et al. use causal intervention methods in their Future Lens approach [14] to show that individual hidden states at position t contain signals rich enough to predict future tokens at t + 2 or beyond, and this insight has been used to improve performance of models [6; 1]. However, existing interpretability research predominantly focuses on token-level predictions by examining how models predict individual words or tokens [11], rather than exploring broader contexts such as the thematic coherence of a sentence or paragraph. Our work aims to bridge the gap between token-level and paragraph-level understanding by investigating whether the information content of single-token activations remains relevant when we consider sequences of tokens, with a specific focus on the \"\\n\\n\" double newline token. We hypothesize that these activations contain information about the structure and content of the following paragraph, providing insight into the model\u2019s comprehension of larger textual units. In section 2, we demonstrate through a preliminary experiment that text structure is embedded in a language model\u2019s attention scores. In section 3, we examine the extent to which a model, at the start of a paragraph, has already planned the rest of the generated text. To explore this, we patch activations onto a model with a neutral prompt \u2013 a double newline \u2013 and investigate whether the future paragraph contains information transferred at the hidden representation level. The code for our experiments is available anonymously. Compute details can be found in Appendix B. Preprint. Under review.             \f2 Is Text Structure Encoded in the Model\u2019s Attention Patterns? To motivate our approach, we first demonstrate that sequences of paragraphs can be identified through the analysis of an LLM\u2019s attention activations. We generate texts by prompting a model with instructions phrased as: \"Tell me about topic 1 in k words \\n\\n tell me about topic 2 in k words.\" These generated texts, referred to as original contexts, are structured uniformly by instructing the model not to generate headings and additional comments. We then extract and inspect the combined attention patterns across all heads for each model-generated text. To observe the context switch, we conduct two key analyses, averaging across the textual generations: (1) the distribution of attention weights close to the topic change, and (2) the cosine similarity of attention output activations inside and across paragraphs, or topics. Experiment (1) checks to what extent attention heads focus on the current paragraph, whilst (2) investigates if attention outputs differ between paragraphs. Figure 1: (Left): Heat map of the average attention weights around the topic change. (Right): Cosine similarity between attention activations. Results averaged over 1,000 model-generated original contexts, sharing a common structure. Figure 1 shows the results of our attention pattern analysis. In our study, we used 20 prompts (i.e., pairs of topics), generating 50 texts per prompt, for a total of 1,000 generated texts. The generations were implemented with the Gemma 2, 9b model at a temperature of 0.3, and activations were retrieved using the HuggingFace Transformers library [25]. On the left, the attention weights indicate that the model tends to attend to previous tokens almost exclusively from the same paragraph. On the right, the cosine similarities of attention outputs show how strongly text structure is encoded across various layers. In the first 18 layers, the cosine similarities of attention activations increase within paragraphs and decrease across paragraphs, suggesting that the model is learning abstract representations in early layers, where it gradually develops an understanding of the paragraph topic. Another consistent finding across all experimental settings is that distinctions between paragraphs diminish in the final layers, from layer 30 onwards. We conjecture that this may be due to the model eventually producing text of a very similar overall form for both topics. An additional plot displaying the cosine similarities for all 42 model layers can be found in Appendix A. Altogether, our preliminary experiments suggest that our model maintains a strong contextual awareness during text generation, in line with research allowing consistent text embed fine-tuning [28], and \"planning\" [9; 26; 8]. These results also confirm that the context switch at the start of a paragraph is encoded in the activation space. Figure 2: Diagram describing our approach.

I only think it's fair that she returns hers because she talks with more and knows more of what to get her while I'm floundering around maybe running into something that could be considered worthwhile. Then to make matters worse my mother has been getting a kick out of this because for some reason to her it's funny that we're fighting over who can give her the gift. I will give it to her though she did offer the suggestion of buying the matching massaging neck piece and then it would look coordinated at least. But I wanted to give the slippers because they are going to be used the most, and my sister has dug her heels in insisting it be her way. Ugh! I'm soooo mad about this at the moment. I mean maybe to people on the outside looking in it wouldn't seem like such a disaster but her and my sister were only a year apart mostly and they always were closer because of the age difference. To this day that hasn't changed I mean they're both on the same social media, go to the same schools, I mean they're inseparable. I don't know how to combat that bond of theirs and try to make it seem like I'm interested in that as well. I do suppose however there was the way my mother said and it would look like there was as much thought involved anyway but how do I back down from the sister? I mean it could start a whole new conflict if she wants to get her the other item, and I say I'll get it? You know I bet she doesn't even realize how lucky she is to have people fighting over what to get her? I mean I guess it's not really a big deal but it matters enough to cause all this commotion in the family. I wonder if there's anything else I could get that would be just as great? I just wanted her birthday to be special this year and I feel as though it's all blowing up in face. I mean I wonder if I'm over reacting?

Treat them like a potential ally who made a mistake rather than the aggressor. For example, say, \"A lot of times, straight people don't really understand bisexuality. I know you weren't trying to be hurtful, so I just want you to understand me a little better.\" Remember, the goal is to educate your friend. It's therefore important your friend understands why the comment was disrespectful. This way, they won't make similarly offensive remarks in the future. For example, say, \"I prefer to define my own sexuality and I don't need you to explain it for me. Also, bisexual people don't really see themselves as half-gay and half-straight. We have our own identity.\" During the conversation, make sure you don't come off as accusing your friend of being hateful or bigoted. Don\u2019t blame them or be too defensive either. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to ensure that you are only expressing your perspective. Even if your friend is prejudiced, they may react poorly if they feel personally attacked. Try to address the comment in a calm, objective way instead of attacking their character. For example, don't say, \"I felt like you were being biphobic.\" Instead, say, \"I felt like the comment was biphobic.\" People are not always receptive to criticism. Your friend may become defensive or make excuses. Calmly stand your ground if your friend does not want to listen to your criticism. It's important that you feel heard and your friend understands that your feelings were hurt.  You can listen to your friend's side. In fact, it can be helpful. If your friend simply wasn't thinking, they may offer an explanation in addition to an apology. However, do not let an explanation be an excuse. Say something like, \"Okay, I understand you meant that as a joke, but it really bothered me given the context.\" You can also ask your friend questions at the end of the conversation to ensure that they understand your perspective and will not make the comments again. For example, you could ask your friend, \"Did you understand that those comments were offensive?\" or \"Can I rely on you to be more aware in the future before making this type of comment?\"\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 14th, and 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [14, 21]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([13, 20], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"14th\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"21st\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the 14th and 21st sentences\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"should not be altered\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"I\", 10, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"you\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"about\", 1, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ask a loved one or trusted friend to go with you to the appointments before the surgery and take notes on what you will need to do. The person will also be able to provide you with emotional support. If you don\u2019t understand what the doctor wants you to do, don\u2019t be afraid to ask. It is important that you follow the instructions; the doctor will prefer that you ask lots of questions, rather than make a mistake.  If no one is able to accompany you, you can take notes yourself and then read them back to the doctor to confirm that you understood correctly or you can ask your doctor if you can record the conversation. If you ask to record the conversation, explain why you want to do this. It is important to discuss your medications in detail with your doctor before the day of surgery. Your doctor needs to know what medications you are on, how much you take, and when you take them. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and vitamins. Your doctor will be able to evaluate whether they are likely to interact with the anesthesia or other medications that you will need.  Be honest with your doctor if you abuse drugs or alcohol. It is important that your doctor know exactly what chemicals are in your system in order to plan your procedure. Your doctor may ask specifically about medications such as aspirin or other blood thinners. You might be advised not to take them right before the surgery. This might include preparations to do in the day before or morning of the surgery. It might also include ways to prepare for the recovery period. Read and review the hospital\u2019s discharge policy. If you have any questions, ask them now. Things to ask include:  When should you stop eating or drinking the day before the surgery? Do you need to stop taking medications before the surgery? Do you need to wash with a special antibacterial soap before the surgery? How long will the recovery take? Are there any special arrangements that you should make ahead of time? Your doctor may have suggestions based on how long the recovery is likely to take. Both emotional and physical support are important for a safe and quick recovery. There are several things you might want to consider:   Cook and freeze food before your surgery so that you won\u2019t have to worry about what to eat or where to get it while you are recovering. Then during your recovery, you can simply remove your frozen meals from the freezer, thaw them, and have something delicious to enjoy. Make changes in your house to minimize the physical activity you will have to do. If your your bedroom is upstairs, you can prepare a bed downstairs so that you don\u2019t have to climb stairs until you are ready. You can also make arrangements to have a friend or housekeeping service help you with the housework if you need it. If you live alone, you might consider asking a friend to stay with you for a few days to provide emotional support and help. This person will both be able to provide you with emotional support and help you get settled at home. Your doctor will probably instruct you not to drive for several weeks after surgery. Make plans to have friends and family members drive you places you may need to go. This will give you time to pack everything without feeling rushed or anxious the morning of the surgery. It will help prevent you from forgetting anything important. You should bring:  A list of your medications and what they are prescribed for. Your health insurance card. If you have extra documentation for prescription drugs, bring that as well. Personal items such as glasses, hearing aids, and dentures Toiletry items such as a comb, brush, toothbrush, razor Walking aids like a cane or walker A robe, slippers, and your favorite pillow Loose clothing. Women should bring a comfortable, wireless bra. Books or music that will help you relax No electronics or valuables A small amount of money to store in a hospital safe, if one will be available to you. This will enable you to pay for medications that you take home with you. Be sure to get plenty of sleep the night before and to follow any fasting instructions given by your doctor. This may include:  Showering and washing with a special soap, provided by the hospital Taking only medications your doctor has said you can take Taking off all jewelry and nail polish Removing contact lenses, dentures, and glasses before going into surgery Telling your anesthesiologist if you have difficulties tolerating anesthesia\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 46th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [46]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'surgery'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "surgery", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.25, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(46, \"equal\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(50, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(46, \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_modification_check([46], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"surgery\", \"keep\")"]}}}

The output should contain fewer than 26 sentences and be under 520 tokens:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), and Gemini (Reid et al., 2024), have been empowered with the intelligence in generating natural language through their pretraining on large corpora. Such LLMs have drawn extensive attraction, both in terms of performance and applications. As proposed by Shanahan et al. (2023), role-playing is a novel application area for large language models, such as virtual role-playing games and the training of social skills (OthlinghausWulhorst et al., 2020), it involves employing LLMs to imitate human or virtual characters\u2019 language use, as well as to learn their behavior, characteristics, and phrases. To enhance the performance of pre-trained LLMs in specific tasks, such as role-playing, fine-tuning has emerged as an active approach in natural language processing (NLP), which is designed to help models perform better in unseen tasks with minimized costs (Chung et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023). By leveraging sufficient role-playing data, LLMs can acquire knowledge about a role\u2019s background, characteristics, and commonly used phrases through fine-tuning. This process allows them to perform customized roleplaying tasks effectively. One straightforward method for collecting role-playing data is to create the role\u2019s script. However, existing research indicates that manually collecting and constructing each role\u2019s script is costly (Shao et al., 2023), and the performance of fine-tuning the model directly on script data is relatively poor (Wang et al., 2023). To address these challenges, several methods have been proposed. ChatHaruhi (Li et al., 2023) introduces an approach that enables LLMs to generate dialogue for a target role by utilizing questions from the original stories. Character-LLM (Shao et al., 2023) constructs dialog data by abstracting each character\u2019s profile from relevant sources (like wiki) and then generating scenes based on the profiles. ROLELLM (Wang et al., 2023) explores the Context-Instruction method, which leverages state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs to generate dialogue from the role\u2019s profile and structured historical conversation data. In this paper, we present a prompt-based framework that exclusively utilizes the SOTA LLM for generating role-playing data and evaluating the LLMs\u2019 role-playing performance. This framework consists of four steps: (1) Role Plot Construction: leveraging the existing memory of the SOTA LLM, like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), we construct unique plots for each character with carefully designed prompts. (2) Dialogue Generation: based on the generated plots, we prompt the SOTA LLM to generate questions and answers, which are then combined into well-formatted datasets. (3) Low-Rank Adaptation (Lora) Tuning: with a sufficient amount of role-playing data, we fine-tune a list of selected open-source             \fLLMs using the Low-Rank adaptation (Lora) approach (Hu et al., 2021), which enables the LLMs to memorize the character\u2019s background story, tone, and pet phrase and further improve their performance.

The output should have fewer than 24 sentences, with each sentence containing no more than 38 words:\n\nPre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020b), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), have exhibited remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Notably, their multilingual versions have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual settings (Pires et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019). In these scenarios, \u2217 equal contribution PLMs are fine-tuned on English data, often with limited or even without data from other languages, yet they acquire the proficiency to handle tasks in different languages. However, multilingual PLMs are typically constructed using stacked transformer layers or their variants, employing self-attention mechanisms to capture diverse and distant dependencies among tokens. The use of self-attention introduces significant computational complexity. Consequently, the inference complexity of multilingual PLMs has become a bottleneck, limiting their deployment on devices sensitive to latency and constrained by computational resources. To fulfill the stringent requirements for efficient inference in applications, various methods have been proposed to accelerate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) inference. These methods include model compression (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020, 2019), early exiting (Xin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021), and model cascading (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). Among these, model cascading methods are particularly appealing for several reasons: 1) They do not depend on specific hardware support, such as custom chips and GPUs. 2) They eliminate the need to train an inference-efficient model from scratch on the pre-training corpora. 3) They offer flexibility to adapt to the latest, incrementally powerful PLMs. Model cascading methods involve the aggregation of multiple PLMs with different sizes. Confidence scores are computed sequentially, ranging from small to large size models, to determine the appropriate model to employ. Once a confidence score surpasses a threshold, the corresponding model is selected, and the inference process ends. Cascade-based models, however, exhibit notable limitations in cross-lingual scenarios. The confidence score, which measures the probability of the current prediction being correct in cascade-based models, is determined by the maximum output             \fold determined on English data to be applicable to other languages. Specifically, we introduce a plugin calibration step at the base of mPLMs. Initially, we normalize the logits to alleviate over-confidence during model fine-tuning. Subsequently, we implement a temperature scaling step to adjust the logits with a learnable scalar parameter. The proposed framework calibrates each individual model in the cascade, providing more reliable confidence scores. This, in turn, enhances the model\u2019s performance and generalization capabilities, leading to consistent improvements in efficiency and accuracy across different languages. Importantly, the proposed framework only requires an extra calibration module at the base of mPLMs, preserving the original architectures of mPLMs. Hence, it demonstrates flexibility to accommodate the latest models with minimal additional training overhead. The primary contributions of this paper is C3, a flexible and effective framework for enhancing efficiency in cross-lingual inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dedicated to the design of inference-efficient models specifically tailored for cross-lingual scenarios. Based on the observation of a notable overconfidence phenomenon in both encoder-only PLMs and decoderonly PLMs in cross-lingual scenarios, and considering that the extent of overconfidence appears to be correlated with linguistic distance, we introduce a plug-in calibration module to address this issue. Extensive experiments on five crosslingual benchmarks, including XNLI, PAWS-X, QAM, GSM8k, and TabMWP, where the first three are text classification datasets and the later two are generation datasets, indicate that the proposed C3 outperforms baselines significantly and achieves a good efficiency-accuracy trade-off, e.g., preserving 98.10% of BERT\u2019s performance and 95.28% of Llama-2\u2019s performance on classification task and an average of 74.3% performance on generation task only half the computation costs.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 38 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 38}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(38, \"less than\")"]}}}

Use a 10% diluted bleach solution, mixing 1 part chlorine bleach with 1 part water. Make your cut just below the flower head. Pruning dead parts of the plant not only improves its appearance, but it will also encourage new growth and healthy blossoming. When you locate a stem to remove, follow it back to the base of the stem and make a straight cut just outside the joint of the parent stem.  Immediately disinfect shears after trimming dead or diseased stems.  This will keep the disease from spreading throughout the plant. It is best to assume that any dead stem died as a result of a disease.  Disinfecting after each pruning session may require more bleach, but it will keep your cactus healthy and beautiful. Trace them back to the parent stem and cut at the base. These stems are usually located along the outer edges.  Remove stems as needed until all sides of the plant are fairly uniform. Snails are fairly simple to spot and remove (use store-bought snail bait), but the aforementioned bugs require specific measures for preventing infestation.  Mealybugs have a waxy, white, cottony appearance.  They are slow-moving and usually are in clusters along leaf veins or spines, on the underside of leaves, and in hidden areas at the joints.  Scale insects resemble small, cottony dome-shaped shells.  They attach themselves to stems and leaves but can be pried off. Spider-mites are hard to see with the naked eye, but signs of infestation include webbing and small brown dots, especially on younger growth.  If you tap the affected area of the plant over a piece of white paper, spider-mites will resemble dust.  These insects tend to suck the plant's juices resulting in weak, wrinkled, or shriveled leaves.  Severe infestations can result in the death of the plant.  The first symptoms can include stickiness or black mold on or near the plant. You can also spray with a diluted alcohol solution of 1 parts alcohol and 3 parts water. Spraying is best for fighting spider-mite infestation and other hard-to-spot bugs.  Be cautious, however, as this may damage the epidermis of the cactus.  Test a small area before spraying the entire plant. Insecticidal soap can be purchased at your local garden or home improvement store. This treatment may also damage your cactus.  Since cacti have oils and waxes that make them susceptible to damage, it is best to use it sparingly and to test a small area before washing the entire cactus. Use insecticides like Neem or pyrethrins for visible bugs.  Systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid or Acephate are best for controlling pests that aren't as easily accessible. Consult the label to see how much you should use on your cactus and whether or not prolonged use is safe. Remember that infestation isn't just harmful, it is contagious and will spread from plant to plant until it is stopped. Check new plants carefully for the previously mentioned symptoms and bugs.  If you are sure it is pest free, keep it in an area far away from the infected plants.  If you do find pests on your new plants, it may be best to simply discard it rather than treat it to save you time, money, and effort.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 23th, and 24th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [23, 24]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([22, 23], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 24], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

Many people take dietary supplement, like fish oil pills, to gain essential nutrients. However, the effectiveness of substitutes is unclear. You should get your nutrition primarily from real foods rather than supplements and oils.  You do not have to unnecessarily complicate a diet plan for rheumatoid arthritis. A healthy overall diet will help you get you the nutrients you need. Stick to a variety of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins. Omega-3 fatty acids can help ease the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by reducing inflammation and pain. They are also good for your health overall. Strive to eat fish for a few meals a week. You may notice a reduction in symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The following fish are particularly good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids:  Anchovies Salmon Sardines Eel Tuna Trout Mackerel Herring Whitebait Many people with arthritis develop issues with anemia (the inability to incorporate iron into your blood) due to certain chronic diseases. Upping your iron intake can help offset anemia, so strive to get a variety of iron rich foods into your diet. If you decide to take an iron supplement, then you may also need to take a stool softener because iron supplements can cause constipation. The following foods are rich in iron:  Dark green vegetables such as spinach and kale Red meat Lentils Haricot beans Calcium strengthens bones, which can help reduce symptoms of arthritis. You are at a greater risk for developing osteoporosis if you have arthritis, and a calcium-rich diet can help reduce your risk.  Low-fat dairy products such as low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese can be a great source of calcium. Calcium-enriched milks, including non-dairy milks like soy milk, can be an excellent source of calcium. Fish eaten with the bones still intact, like sardines, can also help you get more calcium. In addition to providing calcium, you can also get more Omega-3 fatty acids with such fish. Osteoporosis of the hip or spine is common in arthritis. Certain foods have not been shown to increase symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. If you experience an arthritis flare up, you should opt for these foods until your pain passes. This will prevent your diet from worsening arthritis pain. The following should be safe to eat during a flare-up:  Brown rice Cooked and dry fruits Cooked vegetables, such as artichoke, broccoli, chards, asparagus, collards, sweet potatoes, and spinach If you're still experiencing arthritis pain after adjusting your diet, supplements may help. However, you should never simply start taking supplements on your own. Without medical testing, you will not know if you have vitamin deficiencies. You also want to make sure vitamins do not interfere with any existing medication.  If you want to try supplements, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor may want to run blood tests to see if supplements would help you. You should also ask your doctor any questions you have about when and how to take dietary supplements. You may want to take fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, or iron supplements.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

These advancements have primarily targeted the needs and problems of those populations. Even within these countries, racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities have been largely underrepresented in the construction of such models and technologies. This paper describes research and work with Indigenous communities performed in the context of a joint project by IBM Research and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, covering a period from early 2022 to mid-2024, under the auspices of the Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI)1. The work described in this paper is premised on the need to increase the diversity of representation and knowledge in the technologies and language models being built. This involves encompassing a broad and diverse range of languages, peoples, places, and genders, as part of a social justice and decolonial agenda (Buccella, 2023). In particular, we have been working for the past two years to create AI technologies for Indigenous peoples in Brazil, targeting small communities in where Indigenous languages are still in use but under threat. About 200 languages are spoken currently in Brazil by between one to two million people2, but the vast majority of these languages are in danger of disappear until the end of the century (Moseley, 2010). Many of these languages are spoken by fewer than 100 people, often elderly, and are at immediate risk. Even the most spoken Indigenous language in Brazil, Tikuna, probably has at most 50,000 speakers. The projects and ideas described here explore the development of technologies to support Indigenous communities in documenting, preserving, and vitalizing their languages. Developing language technologies, both for speech and text, for these languages has been difficult in the past because of a lack of resources and linguistic knowledge and of appropriate computational technologies capable of working with small amounts of data. However, as discussed in a recent UNESCO publication (Llanes-Ortiz, 2023), \u201c... artificial intelligence, natural language processing and automated speech recognition and voice processing could pro#ProIndL_B_eng. 2According to the 20 Brazilian Census, respectively. 22 l u J 2 ] L C . s c [ v22.02 : v i X r a             \fvide a crucial boost to language revitalization efforts, but these technologies need to be developed in accordance with the rights and provisions set by, among others, the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty [...]. Yet, the need to develop voice recognition, machine translation, speech processing, and text analysis technologies for Indigenous languages cannot be overstated.\u201d (Llanes-Ortiz, 2023, p. 168). The emergence of LLMs in recent years has positively changed the landscape of opportunities, in our view, for those efforts. Paradoxically, while LLMs need to be trained with gruesome amounts of data, at extremely high costs, they also have the ability to address new needs and requirements by methods such as prompt engineering, RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), and by fine-tuning them with small amounts of data. Although the first two techniques do not help much in the context of endangered Indigenous languages, since it is unlikely that standard LLM models have ever seen samples of them, the fine-tuning approach has led to some cases of success (see a detailed review of related works in section 7). Fine-tuning LLMs with tiny amounts of data is the main method explored in this work to create useful language tools such as automatic translators, spell-checkers, and editing tools. Some of the techniques described here may also applicable to domains outside Indigenous languages. Moreover, from a scientific standpoint, working with endangered Indigenous languages spoken by small groups of people has the additional benefit of guarantying that all fine-tuning effects come from this process and not from contamination errors, as discussed in (Pinhanez et al., 2023). The recent success of LLMs is, from the technical side, a strong incentive to work on textbased tools. However, orality is a major component of most Indigenous languages and, even more troublesome, most of those languages use writing systems which were adapted from western languages (Franchetto, 2020). In spite of that, creating tools to foster reading and writing is very important to strengthen endangered Indigenous languages. While young children are often the focus of vitalization efforts, it is common for Indigenous people to lose interest in their own language during the teenage to early adulthood period, by means of language attrition (Schmid, 2011). The loss of interest in the native language is likely compounded by the interest in using and exploring the digital world at those ages. The challenge is furthered by the fact that it is generally easier to forget a language that one does not know how to read and write in (Jayasuriya et al., 1992; Burn et al., 2014). We thus decided to focus our activities on creating writing tools and translators for endangered Indigenous languages, particularly for young people and written content creators of those languages. The works and ideas described in this paper are structured around three basic research themes. First, we have been exploring how to adapt current (and possibly create new) AI and NLP algorithms given the constraints imposed by ultra low-resource and endangered languages. Second, we have been investigating whether these AI- and NLP-based technologies can actually support Indigenous communities\u2019 language vitalization and documentation efforts, especially in the case of endangered languages. And third, we have been looking into how to promote the development and use of language technologies for Indigenous communities in a sustainable and ethical way.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 20th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 20]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 720 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 720}, "function_call": "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 19], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(720, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Look online, in books, and magazines. Ask friends if they have instructions for designs. Make sure your friends are at roughly the same skill level as you are.  Double-check on whether your friends are using their design- you don't want to look like a copy cat. Make a shortlist of about five different designs that you like. When picking the card that you'd like to make for your teacher, think about different aspects, not just the final product:  Think about what your card should express: does the design capture it? Do you want a funny, a sentimental or a happy card? Look at the difficulty level- is it something you can do by yourself? Be honest with yourself and ask for help if it looks too hard. After you've picked your card, it's time to get to the next step in the planning phase.  Read the instructions carefully, and if possible, compare with pictures or videos. See if there are tips and helpful hints in the instructions that you can use. Write the list noting how much of what material you need. Once you have a list together, assemble your materials- see what you have and get the materials you still need.  Take stock of what you already have- sometimes you can use old items you don't need anymore. For example, you could use old crayola stumps to form your teacher's initials on the card.  Go to an arts and crafts store to buy what you need - often the sales people have great ideas and can help, too! This can be a bit of a tedious step, but in order to get the design and the card right, be extra diligent when it comes to following the instructions.  Read every step carefully to make sure you know what to do. Take notes after you've completed your step- this can help you in the future. Ask someone for help if you are unsure of how you should do something. This is one of the most important parts of the card- it verbalizes your appreciation, and underlines the visual message of the card.  Write from the heart and be specific: What makes your teacher so special? Think about different ways of expressing your gratitude- a haiku for example,   or if it's for your French teacher, try it en fran\u00e7ais! This is the last step, so make sure your delivery is perfect!  Deliver the card after school- before school starts, teachers often have a lot of prep-work- you don't want to interrupt! Approach your teacher after class. Smile and say: \"This is for you, I made it!\" Send your card to school in the mail in a big, brightly colored envelope if you are shy or don't have time to deliver it in person. This will make your teacher feel extra special.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 18 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(0, \"change\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should have more than 9 words, and the output should contain fewer than 37 sentences:\n\nWrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch or tearing to the ligament(s). A mild wrist sprain (Grade 1), infers some ligament stretching, but no significant tearing; a moderate sprain (Grade 2) infers significant tearing (up to 50% of the fibers) and may be associated with some loss of function; a severe sprain (Grade 3) infers a greater degree of tearing or complete rupture of ligaments. As such, movement in your wrist will be relatively normal (albeit painful) with Grade 1 and 2 sprains. A Grade 3 sprain often leads to instability (too much range of motion) with movement because the ligaments attaching the wrist bones are completely torn.  In general, only some Grade 2 and all Grade 3 wrist sprains need medical attention. All Grade 1 and most Grade 2 sprains can be managed at home. A Grade 3 wrist sprain can involve an avulsion fracture \u2014 the ligament tears away from the bone and takes a small chip of bone with it.  The most common ligament sprained in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone. Again, wrist sprains are highly variable in severity, so the type and/or amount of pain varies greatly also. Grade 1 wrist sprains are mildly painful and the pain is often described as a soreness that can be sharp with movement. Grade 2 sprains are moderately or severely painful, depending on the degree of tearing; the pain is sharper than a Grade 1 tear and sometimes also throbbing because of the increased inflammation. Perhaps paradoxically, Grade 3 sprains are often less painful initially than a Grade 2 sprain because the ligament is completely severed and not irritating surrounding nerves as much. However, Grade 3 wrist sprains eventually start to throb quite a bit due to the accumulating inflammation.  Grade 3 sprains that involve an avulsion fracture are very painful immediately, and involve both sharp and throbbing type pain. Sprains generate the most pain with movement and are usually much less symptomatic with lack of movement (immobilization). In general, if your wrist is very painful and difficult to move, see your doctor right away and get it assessed. Sprains of all grades respond well to ice or cold therapy because it reduces inflammation and numbs surrounding nerve fibers that generate pain. Ice is particularly important for Grade 2 and 3 wrist sprains because they cause more inflammation to accumulate around the injury site. Applying ice to a sprained wrist for 10\u201315 minutes every one to two hours immediately following an injury makes a big impact after a day or so and significantly reduces the intensity of pain, which makes movement much easier. In contrast, icing a wrist fracture is certainly helpful for pain and inflammation control, but the symptoms often return after the effects wear off. Thus, as a general rule, cold therapy is more impactful on sprains that it is on most fractures.  The more serious the sprain, the more swelling you'll see localized around the injury, which will make the area look puffy and enlarged. Small hairline (stress) fractures are often more impacted by cold therapy (long term) than more serious fractures, which require medical attention. Inflammation creates swelling, but that's not the same as bruising. Instead, bruising is caused by localized bleeding into the tissues from injured small arteries or veins. Grade 1 wrist sprains usually don't cause bruising, unless the injury was from a hard blow that crushed the small subcutaneous blood vessels. Grade 2 sprains involve more swelling, but again, not necessarily much bruising \u2014 it depends how the injury occurred. Grade 3 sprains involve lots of swelling and typically significant bruising because trauma that causes ruptured ligaments is usually severe enough to also rip or damage the surrounding blood vessels.  Swelling from inflammation doesn't cause much color change in the skin, aside from some redness from \"flushing\" due to the heat created. The dark blue color of bruising is caused by blood leaking into the tissues just below the surface of the skin. As the blood degrades and gets flushed out of those tissues, the bruise changes color (lighter blue, then eventually yellowish). Essentially all Grade 1 wrist sprains, and some Grade 2 sprains, feel significantly better after a few days, especially if you rest the injury and apply cold therapy to it. As such, if your wrist feels pretty good, there's no visible swelling and you can move it without much pain, then likely no medical intervention is needed. If your wrist was more seriously sprained (Grade 2), but feels significantly better after a few days (even if some swelling is noted and the pain is still moderate), then give it a little more time to recover. However, if your injury hasn't improved much or is actually worse after a few days, then a medical assessment is likely needed as soon as possible.  Grade 1 and some Grade 2 sprains heal quickly (one to two weeks), whereas Grade 3 sprains (particularly with avulsion fractures) take the most amount of time to heal (sometimes a few months). Hairline (stress) fractures can also heal pretty quickly (couple of weeks), whereas more serious fractures can take a few months or more, depending if surgery is done.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 37 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"]}}}

However, ICL has been shown to be unstable in that slight changes to the in-context prompts (e.g., reordering of demonstrations) can lead to substantial differences in performance (Lu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). This circumstance is difficult to control due to a lack of understanding of the model\u2019s working mechanisms, leaving us uncertain about the exact process by which LLMs learn to perform a task from demonstrations. Previous papers have begun to explore \u2217Work in progress. \u2020 Corresponding author. Figure 1: An illustration of the 4-way text classification on AGNews with different parts of its 4-shot ICL demonstrations masked with respect to the attention of the test example. Masking the representations of what we call the template and stopword tokens from the attention of the test example leads to a significant drop in performance while masking representations of the content tokens leaves the performance relatively unchanged. this issue, focusing on specific aspects such as the label space (Min et al., 2022) and the hidden states of the last prompt token (Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023), but have been limited in scope. In this work, we conduct a more comprehensive study on how LLMs extract information valuable to improving task performance from demonstrations, by characterizing the model\u2019s task-encoding tokens. Conceptually, task-encoding tokens are defined as tokens whose representations encode the tasksolving process.

In other words, removing the representations of these tokens should lead to diminished task performance. In this paper, we identify and analyze the characteristics of task-encoding tokens, motivated by two main reasons: 1) The identification of task-encoding tokens is likely to provide new insights into how large language models leverage critical information useful for performing a task. 2) Analyzing the characteristics of task-encoding tokens helps us better understand how they are different from the tokens whose representations do not explicitly affect the ICL performance, which would provide insights into avoiding possible instability caused by improperly utilizing these tokens. In order to identify the task-encoding tokens, we divide tokens into three structural categories: template tokens, stopword tokens (including punctuations, conjunctions, etc.), and content tokens. Intuitively, template tokens structure the entire ICL prompt into organized text by indicating the task input and output, while stopword tokens contribute to the overall structure of the plain text. With these structural categories in mind, we ablate the representations of tokens of different types from the attention of ICL test examples, masking partial information during the model\u2019s solving of the task. We use the observed changes in task performance to draw conclusions about which types of tokens are likely task-encoding tokens, as shown in Figure 1. Results of these experiments provide evidence that template tokens and stopword tokens are the most prone to be task-encoding tokens as ablating their representations together significantly decreases performance. In contrast, content tokens have a negligible impact on performance. We further investigate every token in the template with the same ablation method, confirming that most of these tokens have representations necessary for preserving the task performance. Beyond identifying task-encoding tokens, we investigate other ways in which they may differ from other tokens. We find the following three distinguishing characteristics: the lexical meaning of tokens as it relates to the task being solved, the repetition of tokens throughout the prompt, and the text formatting which the tokens provide to the prompt. Our research indicates that the lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting brought by task-encoding tokens contribute to task performance across all model sizes, suggesting that these characteristics should not be disrupted in order to avoid performance fluctuation, therefore maintaining its stability. Our work reveals that we can identify and characterize the types of tokens with representations that are most needed for an LLM to perform well on downstream tasks during the ICL process. We investigate the characteristics of lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting related to task-encoding tokens which allow us to partially explain the presence of task-encoding tokens and help us better avoid the instability caused by them. Our findings deepen the understanding of the roles different types of tokens play in large language models, suggesting future work based on leveraging specific representations of different token types.

As soon as I found out this information and the location of the event and cooking options I began researching for recipes and methods of preparing food for large groups of people. I wanted the food to be delicious and to be able to keep making it fresh throughout the day and for the drinks to be tasty while giving everyone choices. For the drinks I purchased many watermelons , berries and other melons and created a fruit mix ice and water. We used the carbonation machine at the building to add fizz to the bottles as they had some large seal-able bottles we used to make fruit soda essentially. For the food I began by making sandwich patties with lentils and oats and spices to go along with the grilled vegetables. Dad helped set us the grills and we had a nice even heat going by mid morning and began cutting up the various vegetables and potatoes and yams and onions. We had a large variety of foods all prepared by mid morning and began setting them on the grill in trays and allowed them to cook. The first people starting arriving before noon to help and I wanted to have the first batch of food ready to feed them and also to test the system for when the bulk of the family arrived. The first batch of food, thanks to dad helping watch over and regulating the heat, was perfectly cooked. I asked my aunts and uncles to take a break from setting up the tables and chairs and so we all took a break and tried out all the grilled veggies and potatoes and they each had a bit of the sandwiches too. I then poured them all a fizzy fruit drink and they all said it was delicious. We went to the store and purchased several more watermelons and stopped by the farmers market to see what they had and was able to buy freshly picked strawberries. We also bought a box of potatoes and brought all the food back to the party. A few more relatives arrived while we were out getting food and they volunteered to help prepare the potatoes for the grill. We had many different trays and so decided to spice each tray of potatoes differently with some adding peppers and onions . I also created two trays of brussel sprouts and added several other vegetables. The food was a bit and later we popped a bunch of popcorn and each family also brought a dish and so we had all types of foods and deserts.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"reunion\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"seal-able\", \"remove\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"drink\", 3, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"food\", 4, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"]}}}

Modern natural language processing is driven by the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957), which asserts that the context of a linguistic expression de\ufb01nes its meaning (Emerson, 2020). Because existing words\u2014which represent an extremely small fraction of the space of possible character sequences\u2014appear in context together, the distributional paradigm at this level is limited in its ability to study the meaning of and information encoded by arbitrary character level n-grams (word forms). Furthermore, state-of-the-art computational language models operating within the distributional paradigm, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), are mainly trained on extant words. Yet, a plethora of insights into language learning have emerged from inquiries into language beyond extant words, such as the grammatical errors and inference patterns that children exhibit when distinguishing extant words from non-linguistic auditory signals, including emotional expressions, auditory gestures, and other forms of paralinguistic speech (Yang, 2006; Carey, 2000). We therefore propose that character n-grams (i.e., sequences of alphabetic characters) outside the space of extant language can provide new insights into the meaning of words and how they are represented by these models, beyond that captured by word and subword-based distributional semantics alone. We explore this by studying the embeddings of randomly generated character n-grams (referred to as garble), which contain primitive communicative information but are devoid of meaning, using the CharacterBERT model (El Boukkouri et al., 2020). Such randomly generated character n-grams are textual analogues of paralinguistic vocalizations\u2014vocal extra-speech sounds and noises. Our analyses contribute to the growing understanding of BERTology (Rogers et al., 2020) by identifying a dimension, which we refer to as the information axis, that separates extant and garble 22 r p A2 ] L C . s c [ v17.02 : v i X r a             \fn-grams. This \ufb01nding is supported by a Markov model that produces a probabilistic information measure for character n-grams based on their statistical properties. Strikingly, this information dimension correlates with properties of extant language; for example, parts of speech separate along the information axis, and word concreteness varies along a roughly orthogonal dimension in our projection of CharacterBERT embedding space. Although the information axis we identify separates extant and randomly generated n-grams very effectively, we demonstrate that these classes of n-grams mix into each other in detail, and that pseudowords\u2014i.e., phonologically coherent character n-grams without extant lexical meaning\u2014lie between the two in our CharacterBERT embeddings. This paper is organized as follows. We \ufb01rst discuss concepts from natural language processing, information theory, and linguistics relevant to our study. We then analyse CharacterBERT representations of extant and randomly generated character sequences and how the relation between the two informs the structure of extant language, including morphology, part-of-speech, and word concreteness.

Be sure not to alter the 8th and 26th sentences. The output should consist of more than 30 sentences:\n\nThe drums are the most important part of your beat and form the structure to the entire song. Especially in hip-hop, where singers need a steady rhythm to rap over, you need to create a solid foundation for melody, vocals, and orchestration.  Start with the classic trio of drum beats -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. Play with these three drums to produce the bouncy, up-tempo feel of classic rap and hip-hop songs. Ex. DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena.   Download free drum packs online to find unique percussion and sounds the incorporate into your songs. Experiment with other sounds for percussion. Producers such as J Dilla (Ex. \"Waves\") became famous for using voices, sirens, pops, and other noises in place of drums. (Ex. 50 Cent's \"Heat\" uses gun noises for percussion) Hip-hop has its roots in jazz, funk, and soul, and just like the genres that spawned it, all hip-hop tracks require two basic instruments: drums and bass. A bass line gives your song a basic template for the melody  Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\" or complex, like Common's \"Be (Intro).\" Practice meshing the bass line with your kick drum, as they both emit low frequency notes. Layer them so you can hear both, like in the songs above. Once you've established the \"groove\" of the song with bass and drums, it's time to make it really shine. This is where you get to design the feel of a song. If you want an RnB inspired song, for example, you'll want piano, some horns, and maybe some jazzy guitar (Ex. Blues Scholars \"The Ave\"). If you want an epic, cinematic song you'll be adding strings, tubas, gongs, etc (Ex. Big Boi's \"General Patton\"). Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. Looping is when you take several bars of music and repeat throughout a song so it sounds like someone is playing the part the entire time. It allows you to create a consistent beat for the MC to rap over and keeps you from tediously writing out the same part over and over again. The best loops are seamless. That is, it is impossible to tell that the part was essentially copy and pasted together. Sampling is when you splice bit of other songs into your song, using the old part to create something entirely new. Sampling is one of the building blocks of hip-hop producing, but you should always do it with caution -- sampling without permission can be illegal. Use sample sparingly, finding 2-3 notes that you like and distorting them, repeating them, or chopping them up into something new. Whether you do them yourself or have someone else rapping, record the vocals to your song and tinker with the length, chorus placement, and any intros or outros you want. Use your producing skills to mesh the lyrics with the beat. For example, at a moment when the lyrics reference the police, it is common to put a siren sound in the song. When you hear particularly powerful lines or rhythms, considering muting the beat so that listeners can hear the rapper clearly, then jumping back in as a surprise.  Build up the beat-- start the song with just drums and bass, and add an instrument each verse, then break it down in the outro (Ex. Outkast's \"Slump\") Add subtle accents -- even noises that are hard to hear can give the song depth. Read your software manual and learn about EQ, effects and quantization, and use them where necessary.   EQ: Also known as equalization, this is where you adjust the volume, frequency, and sounds of the entire song so that all the parts fit smoothly together.  Effects: There are endless effects, all of which adjust or alter the sound of an instrument to make it fit the mood of the song. They can create echoes, change tones, subtly adjust notes, and much more. They are never permanent, so test them out on every instrument.  Quantization: The art of taking hand-made notes or beats and electronically lining them  up with the beat. Quantization is crucial to make a song sound clean and professional, but overdoing it may make a song seem robotic and bland. The best hip-hop producers forged their own path, learning from the masters while trying things no one else has. Make a song without drums, sample from a polka tune, or use a live band to make your tracks. Follow your creative instincts and keep your ears open to stand out as a producer.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 8th, and 26th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [8, 26]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.36363636363636365, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.5}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"drums.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"beat.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"hip-hop\", 10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"8th sentence.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"26th sentence.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8, 26], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}}

This can help you manage your risk factors.  Bacteria are the most common infectious agents. They can be transmitted via bodily fluids and food. They are single cell living microorganisms that use your body as a home base to replicate. Viruses are pathogens that cannot live outside the host. When a virus enters your body, they hijack your body\u2019s cells to multiply and spread to neighboring cells. Fungi are simple, plant-like living organisms that may take up residence in your body. Parasites are living organisms that hijack the host\u2019s body and use their resources to thrive. Antibiotics are medications that fight off bacterial infections. They work by disabling or killing bacterial cells and thus, fastening the elimination of bacteria by your immune system.  Use topical antibiotic ointments for small wounds that are infected. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, warmth and pain. Do not use antibiotic ointment for heavily bleeding wounds that are deep. Seek medical attention if you have a wound that does not stop bleeding. For systemic bacterial infections, visit your healthcare provider and ask if you should be taking oral antibiotics. It is important to understand that antibiotics cannot cure or treat viral infections, such as the cold or flu. Your doctor can diagnose bacterial versus viral infection and treat it appropriately. Take antibiotics only as directed. Taking antibiotics when you don\u2019t need them (such as when you have a viral infection) increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics but there are some antiviral medications that can be used for certain viruses. Some viral infections are treated with at home remedies (such as rest and remaining hydrated).  Some drugs, known as antiviral or antiretroviral drugs, can fight off certain viruses by taking away their ability to reproduce their DNA inside your cells. Some viral infections, such as the common cold, only need to have their symptoms treated to make you more comfortable. Your immune system can fight off the virus as long as you are not immunocompromised and get enough rest and nutrients. Many viral illnesses can be prevented with vaccinations. Thus, you should keep your immunizations up to date. Some fungal infections can be treated with medications that help eliminate the fungi and clear the infection. However, there are numerous pathogenic fungi that cause infections and only your doctor can diagnose and prescribe proper treatments.  Some fungal infections may be treated with a topical ointment if the infected site is on your skin (such as foot fungus). Very serious and threatening fungal infections are treated with oral medications or injections. Some examples of pathogenic fungi include histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, and these infections can be deadly. As the name implies, parasites are organisms that \"hijack\" your body\u2019s resources in order to live, grow and multiply inside you. Parasites refers to a wide array of pathogenic agents from worms to microscopic cells.  Many parasites can be transferred into your body via contaminated food or water (such as hookworm), while others enter via broken/compromised skin (such as malaria via mosquito bite). You should never drink unfiltered or non-purified water from natural sources as the water may contain parasites. Some parasitic infections can be treated with oral or injected medications. Your doctor can diagnose a parasitic infection based on your symptoms and specific tests and then treat it appropriately.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'some'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "some", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"some\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"some\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(word=\"some\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"]}}}

Put on an old shirt or drape an old towel over your shoulders. Coat your hairline and ear tips with petroleum jelly, then pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. Make sure that your hair is healthy. For best results, deep condition it the night before you bleach it. Purchase a good quality hair bleaching kit that contains bleach and developer. Prepare the bleach in a non-metal bowl according to the kit's instructions.  If you are starting with light brown hair, try a 10 volume developer. If your hair is medium brown, a 20 volume developer might work best for you. If you have dark brown or black hair, use 30 volume with care; it is very strong. to dry hair with a tinting brush starting from the ends. If you need to, divide your hair into 4 sections first. Working quickly, use a tinting brush to apply the bleach all over your hair, starting from the ends and mid-lengths first. Then, go back through your hair, and apply the bleach to the roots.  Never apply bleach starting from the roots. This will cause it to process too fast and may destroy your hair. You can divide your hair into 4 sections first, but you don't have to. How long this takes depends on how dark your hair was to begin with and what volume developer you are using. Look at your hair every 5 minutes; once it reaches a pale blond color, you are ready to wash it out.  Expect to wait anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes. Never leave bleach in your hair for longer than 45 minutes, or you'll destroy your hair. Everyone's hair reacts differently to bleach. Your friend's hair may bleach a lot slower than yours. Rinse the bleach out with cool water first, then apply some shampoo to your hair. Lather your hair up, then rinse the shampoo out. If you want to, you can apply conditioner, but it's best to wait until after the toner. Allow your hair to air dry naturally. It would be best to wait a full 24 hours before you do this, otherwise you'll end up over-processing your hair. Keep in mind that if you have dark brown or black hair, it would be nearly impossible to get it to a platinum blonde color; you will have to settle for darker unicorn hair. If the initial bleaching process made your hair too dry, do not bleach it again. Simply settle for darker unicorn hair. , if your hair ended up with brassy tones. Purchase a hair toner or purple toning shampoo, then apply it to your hair according to the instructions on the bottle. Some need to be used on dry hair while others should be used on wet.  Some hair toners need to be mixed with a developer or white conditioner. Read the instructions to find out. Most hair toners need to sit in your hair for 20 to 30 minutes.  Purple toning shampoos typically need to sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes.  If you have platinum or pale yellow hair, you do not need to tone it. While not absolutely necessary, this is highly recommended. Purchase a deep-conditioning mask meant for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair. Apply it all over your hair, then tuck your hair under a shower cap. Wait for the time recommended on the label, then rinse it out. Some deep conditioners need to sit for only 5 minutes, while others need to sit for 10 to 15 minutes.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.4444444444444444, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bleach\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27], \"change\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"bleach\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"hair\", 10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"]}}}

There were problems in the water system of the building before. I took care of this problem myself because it was simple. then the electrical system began to fail and I don't understand the electricity business, so I gave the building owner notice, but he passed away. but the big problem broke out 3 months ago. In heavy rain, the roof of the house was very bad and the upper floor of the building became unusable. this was purely a structural problem of the house and as a tenant I had no fault of use. the situation again I gave notice to the landlord. at first he wanted to pass. but when I insisted he came and saw the problem in place. I had a really serious damage and, according to the contract, he had to pay compensation to me and get the roof repaired. he would have to pay a substantial amount for these expenses. he told me that, despite the contract between us, he would not pay anything, that if I wanted to sit, I had to accept the building like this, that the rent rate would increase very much due to the shopping mall to be opened soon, and that I was so stupid that I could almost know that I was sitting for free. the landlords in this neighborhood kept saying how positive the new shopping mall would be. but things did not go as expected by the landlords. The company that made the shopping center went bankrupt due to a serious loan debt. The shopping center construction unfinished passed to the lending bank. The bank did not want to continue to the shopping center construction. due to this event, the rental rates in the neighborhood decreased to lower amounts than before. What did my landlord do? albeit forced to repair the roof, he paid me compensation for my belongings. There was only one requirement to extend the duration of the contract for another 5 years. because he knew perfectly well that when I evacuated this house, maybe 1 or 3 years, he can't rent this place to anyone. How do I know? no one has been sitting in the building next to me for exactly 3 years, but the owner of that building has to pay dues for the site costs.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

This marketing or \"front-of-pack\" labeling can provide information to the types of ingredients or the nutritive value of foods.  One common sugar related claim you'll see on boxes and packages is \"sugar-free\", \"zero sugar\" or \"sugarless\".  All of these claims have identical meanings:  there is 0.5 g or less of sugar in each serving of the food. If you're looking for foods with absolutely no sugar, choose foods with these claims on the front. Another common sugar claim is \"no added sugar.\"  This means that no additional sugars have been added to the product during processing;  however, the product contains a natural source of sugar. \"No added sugar\" can be used as a marketing trick since the food may not be actually low in total sugar, since they may contain a lot of sugar naturally. Another term you may see is \"unsweetened.\"  This claim can fall into either of the above categories.  For example, unsweetened tea doesn't have any added sugar or artificial sweeteners; however, unsweetened applesauce has no added sugar, but does contain natural sugar. Regardless of what the package says on the front, it's always important review and verify the claims by looking at the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list.  This will provide you the real story.  The first place you should look is the \"total sugar\" on the nutrition fact panel.  This is listed under the heading \"total carbohydrates\" on the label. The amount of sugar listed here is the total amount of sugar in one serving of the food.  It will include both added sugars and natural sugars.  If you're avoiding added sugars specifically, you'll need to review the ingredient list since the nutrition fact panel doesn't differentiate between the types of sugar. When you're reading the ingredient label, note that the first listed ingredient is the one in the highest amount while the last ingredient is found in the smallest amount. Food manufacturers have gotten very clever about putting a variety of sweeteners in foods \u2014 there are over 60 different names for sugar. There are new names, confusing names and ones that you may have never heard of;  however, they're all considered added sugars.  Look beyond your current knowledge of added sugars.  There are many more names for sugar besides the common versions like:  sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup. Other names for added sweeteners include:  anhydrous dextrose, confectioners sugar, corn syrup solids, dextrose, fructose, honey, molasses, agave syrup, maple syrup, invert sugar, maltose, malt syrup, brown rice syrup, cane juice, sugar in the raw, nectars, sucrose, fruit juices, fruit concentrate, and many more. If you see any of these names in your ingredient list, you'll know there is a source of added sugar in your food. Although you may only be avoiding added sugars that add calories to foods, note that many food companies are also adding artificial sweeteners.  If you're not interested in any added sugars or highly processed artificial sweeteners, you'll need to avoid foods that are sweet but labeled as sugar-free.  To provide consumers with lower calorie, reduced sugar or sugar-free products, food companies are using artificial sweeteners and/or sugar alcohols.  These provide sweetness to foods without adding calories.  Artificial sweeteners will also be listed in the ingredient label.  These may include:  acesulfame potassium, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose or stevia. Foods typically containing artificial sweeteners include:  baked goods, sodas, drink mixes, canned fruit, jams and jellies, dairy products, candy and puddings.  Research has shown that small quantities of artificial sugars present no risk to those who consume them. Like artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols are used to sweeten foods without adding too many calories.  Unlike artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols generally do have a calorie value associated with them; however, it's minimal.  Sugar alcohols are found frequently in sugar-free gums, candies or mints.  In addition, they can be found in:  ice creams, cookies or sugar-free puddings. Sugar alcohols included may be:  erythritol, isomalt, Lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, or xylitol. Be aware the sugar alcohols can have a laxative effect, especially when consumed in larger quantities.  If you're noticing this effect, you may want to limit how many items with sugar alcohols you ingest.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")"]}}}

I'd never used any dating apps before and all my relationships had come from jobs I worked. The initial reaction from Tinder was a rush of excitement and almost adrenaline like. I chatted with various people. I ended up having to cut it off with someone because they seemed far too odd, I got ghosted, I met up with a much older person than me and we ended up being friends, most chats went nowhere. One Sunday morning right before I planned to delete the app I took a look at all of the people who had swiped on me, figuring \"what's the point?\" I saw a 21 year old girl who was a student at the university a work at (I was 24). She was pretty but I couldn't tell much her bio other than her major and that she was a tour guide. A couple hours later I get a message, \"you may have a baby face, but it's adorable. What are you up to today?\" We seemed to have a lot in common, especially since we both knew the university and area well. I could tell even through text she was someone. We hammer out the details, she's no more than 7 minutes from me in an apartment complex. I get there around 7pm and head up to the apartment and I'm very nervous. I'm pretty introverted so meeting people like this is not my thing. She opens the door for me and looks like her profile. We talked for awhile introducing ourselves and decide on a movie. The stream was having buffering issues so Deadpool turned into a 4 hour movie. But I was glad the movie kept pausing, because we talked a ton and I knew there was something about her that made me feel comfortable and at ease. About 5 minutes into the movie she slides across the couch and goes \"excuse me\" and bumps into me. I still laugh about that to this day. For the rest of the movie we cuddled, adjusting so that we were laying down. It was a great time overall, and after that we cuddled for a bit. Fast forward to 7 and I have to go to work. I've been at her place for 12 hours and never slept. From this point on, we're constantly seeing each-other, I realize I love this woman and she feels the same way. Fast forward to present time and she is currently my fiancee and I have never been happier, all from a random Tinder date.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}}}

Even if you only need to rotate, sheets can get tangled, catch on your bed frame, or make it difficult for you to get a grip on your mattress. Strip your bed before doing either to make your job as easy as possible. Pull your mattress away from the headboard, wall, or the head of your bed frame, if possible. Some four poster beds, beds with footboards, and large mattress beds, like king sized ones, may require you to first lift the bottom of the mattress to pull it away from the headboard and rest on the footboard. This position will allow you to most easily helicopter your mattress around on your box spring or frame. Then grasp your mattress by one corner, lift up slightly, and drag it so the bottom faces either the left or the right side.  Check the sides of your mattress for handles. Some mattresses include side handles to make maneuvering and transportation easier. You can rotate your mattress to whatever side is most convenient. Your end goal is to re-position the foot of your bed so it becomes the head. Recenter your mattress after you have pointed the bottom to either the left or the right. The starting head and foot of your bed should be hanging off the left and right sides now, with the mattress roughly in the middle of your box springs or frame. King and Queen sized mattresses may be hard to maneuver with just one corner. If you have a bed this size or larger, you will likely have the easiest time rotating your mattress by propping it on the head- or footboard and sliding it a little at a time until the foot and head of the mattress are pointing off to the sides. You should not prop and pivot your mattress on your head- or footboard if either have sharp angles that might catch on your mattress or if these are not stable. In this case, offset your mattress by pushing one corner of the foot of the mattress inward with respect to the frame and one corner of the head of the mattress outward. The resulting orientation should be offset and tilted on an angle. Grasp your mattress again by the corner and begin sliding it so the bottom takes its new place at the head of the bed. Once your bed is mostly in position, you can make small adjustments until it is completely centered, unless you need to flip your mattress. Once your mattress is rotated, flip-needing mattresses will have to be turned over.  The size of king mattresses makes these prone to developing a hump in the middle. Thanks to the fact that these mattresses are mostly square, you can prevent this hump from forming by only rotating these mattresses 90-degrees and not finishing the rotation. Except for king size mattress, your bed should now be oriented normally, with its long side running from the head of the bed to the foot of the bed. The head and foot of your mattress should now be in exchanged positions. Pull your mattress to either side of your bed so that about half of it hangs off your box springs or frame. Take the overhanging side and lift it until your mattress is standing straight up. Then lower the tall end to the opposite side of the bed. End-over-end flipping can be done similarly; pull and prop your mattress on the head- footboard and then raise the overhanging side and lower it until the bottom of the mattress takes the place of the top.  Generally, you should flip your mattress alternating between side-to-side flipping and end-over-end flipping unless your mattress tag/instructions indicate otherwise. After flipping your mattress, it should overhang the opposite side of the bed. However, at this point it is rotated and flipped. All you need to do is push your mattress into place on your box spring or frame and you're done.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 24 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.7499999999999999, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"rotate\", 3, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(100, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"]}}}

Each sentence should have more than 11 words. Keep the 7th and 10th sentences unchanged:\n\nYou can write: \u201cThe purchase price shall be [insert price]. After earnest money is credited, the remaining balance shall be paid by Purchaser at closing.\u201d Earnest money is a form of security deposit. It is how you show the seller that you are serious about buying the property. Without depositing earnest money, a potential buyer could claim to be interested in any number of homes, effectively removing them from the market. You should include a clause describing the amount of earnest money to be deposited and the deadline for depositing it.  Sample language could read: \u201cEarnest money in the amount of [insert amount] shall be paid to the Escrow Agent, [insert the name of agent and the address], in the form of check or money order. Purchaser shall deliver payment to Escrow Agent no later than 5:30 pm, five (5) calendar days after Seller\u2019s acceptance of this agreement.\u201d You should also clarify that the earnest money will be credited to the purchase price. You need to identify the purchaser's source of financing and ask for proof that they qualify for the financing. Generally, sufficient proof will be a letter from the purchaser's bank or lender.  For example, if the buyer is using cash, then include the following: \u201cThis is a cash offer. The balance of the purchase price will be paid at closing by certified check.\u201d You can also ask that the purchaser include a verification letter stating that funds are available. If the purchaser is getting a loan, then identify the loan type (e.g., VA, FHA, conventional, etc.) Also ask for a letter about the loan status and give a deadline for receiving the letter. A home may come with personal property inside or \u201cfixtures.\u201d Fixtures are improvements made on the property that cannot be removed, such as bookshelves installed in the wall or a fireplace. You should identify any fixtures or items that will be sold with the property, such as:  wall-to-wall carpeting attached light fixtures and bulbs attached mirrors heating and cooling equipment plumbing fixtures ceiling fans doors windows, screens, and storm windows built-in kitchen appliances security systems window treatments awnings fencing If there is anything the seller is taking with them, then be sure to list it in the purchase and sale agreement. For example, you might want to take your kitchen appliances with you. If so, be sure to list them. Also identify any leased items in the house. The purchaser needs to know that you don't own them. This is an important provision. It is often unrealistic to expect someone to purchase a home if they can't sell their current home. By including this provision, the purchaser can get out of the purchase if they can't sell their home. Alternately, the offer might not be contingent on the buyer selling their home. Either way, explain the situation:  \u201cThis offer is contingent upon the sale and close of Purchaser\u2019s property located at [insert location] within [insert number] days.\u201d \u201cThis offer is not contingent upon the sale or close of property owned by Purchaser.\u201d\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 11 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 11}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"earnest money is a form of security deposit.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"You should include a clause describing the amount of earnest money to be deposited and the deadline for depositing it.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"You need to identify the purchaser's source of financing and ask for proof that they qualify for the financing.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Earnest money is a form of security deposit.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Sample language could read:\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"The purchase price shall be [insert price].

Each sentence should contain fewer than 42 words, and the output should consist of more than 24 sentences:\n\n1  Language impairments are evidenced in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Primary  Progressive Aphasia (PPA), Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Patients with AD  are characterized by a progressive deterioration in cognitive domains such as memory, executive  functions, and language, which become more severe as the disease progresses. However, language  impairments  can  appear  before  the  clinical  manifestation  of  AD  and  are  already  evidenced  in  patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), both in the amnestic and non-amnestic variants  (Petersen  et  al.,  1999).  Therefore,  detecting  language  impairments  early  in  MCI  is  critical  to  provide treatments that can prevent symptom progression. Speech, language, and communication  symptoms vary in patients with neurodegenerative disorders as this may depend on the affected  brain  areas,  especially  in  the  left  hemisphere.  Symptom  variation  is  especially  evidenced  in  patients with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), a progressive neurological condition primarily  affecting speech and language (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Mesulam, 1982, 2001). Specifically,  patients with inferior frontal damage are characterized by agrammatism and speech apraxia as their  primary  symptoms  and  are  subtyped  in  the  nonfluent/agrammatic  PPA  variant.  Patients  with  temporal lobe damage are characterized by semantic impairments, such as naming impairments,  and are subtyped in the semantic variant PPA (svPPA). Finally, patients with temporal and parietal  lobe  damage  are  characterized  by  phonological  errors,  repetition,  and  naming  deficits  and  are  subtyped in the logopenic variant PPA.  Assessing language function early can inform clinical decisions concerning remediation  and  compensation  of  language  functioning,  the  effects  and  progress  of  atrophy  on  language,  condition  prognosis,  and  diagnosis  (Strauss  et  al.,  2006).  The  speech  and  language  assessment  aims to determine the language functioning in patients with speech and language impairments and  identify deterioration of language functioning (Georgia Angelopoulou et al., 2018; Battista et al.,  2017; Beales et al., 2018; Fraser, Lundholm Fors, & Kokkinakis, 2019; Matias-Guiu et al., 2022;  Thilakaratne  et  al.,  2022;  Thomas  et  al.,  2018).  Also,  it  can  provide  an  account  of  language  (re)learning  due  to  therapy,  as  learning  is  required  for  proper  recovery  and  compensation  (Krakauer, 2006).  Based  on  recent  findings  from  Computational  Language  Assessment  (CLA)  studies,  a  collective term we use to refer to both AI and Computational Assessment tools, we argue that CLA  is a superior approach to manual language assessment as it can detect dementia symptoms early,  monitor  disease  progression  and  evaluate  treatment  efficacy  by  offering  a  quick,  easy,  and  quantifiable  assessment  of  speech,  language,  and  communication  functioning  (Themistocleous,  2023). They can become easily accessible to patients as apps on their phones or through dedicated  websites,  allowing  direct  access  to  neurocognitive  assessments  to  patients  and  clinicians.  In  addition, it can provide access to populations without access to a clinic for assessment, such as  patients with mobility impairments and disadvantaged socioeconomic and language backgrounds.  Specifically,  CLA  implemented  in  a  computational  application  can  assist  i.  teleconsultation  informing healthcare professionals on patients in remote locations about symptom progression; ii.  3    \ftelehomecare,  supporting  clinicians  and  doctors  that  overview  and  provide  patient  care;  iii.  telemonitoring by providing evaluation data over time, and as such, it can work together with other  monitoring devices, such as devices monitoring heart rate and blood pressure to provide a holistic  picture  of  patients'  condition;  and  iv.  teletherapy,  delivering  speech-language  pathology,  audiology, and other therapy services at a distance (Dial et al., 2019). Furthermore, such applications  can  assist  clinicians  in  assessing  and  scoring  discourse  from  patients  fast  and  with  accuracy,  allowing them to focus on things that matter, such as having more time to treat patients.  In the following, we discuss (i) the main complications of using manual diagnostic batteries  for language assessment in dementia diagnosis (ii) discuss applications of CLA, i.e., studies of  computation  and  automation  for  language  assessment.  (iii)  Finally,  we  discuss  the  underlying  technologies and provide the main branches of CLA.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 42 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 42}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "sentence_length_check(41, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"]}}}

However, the widespread use of these models brings important concerns: hallucinations are frequent (Ji et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023), models are poorly calibrated (Vasudevan et al., 2019; Desai and Durrett, 2020), evaluation is limited and sometimes affected by data contamination (Sainz et al., 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2024), explanations are often unreliable (Zhao et al., 2024; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019), and models often exhibit undesired biases (Gallegos et al., 2024). Reliable uncertainty quantification is key to addressing some of these concerns: NLP systems should not only provide accurate answers but also \u201cknow when they do not know\u201d. Unfortunately, most NLP systems return only single predictions (i.e., point estimates), without reliable confidence information. Systems that quantify uncertainty are much less common and typically limited in various ways: they often make incorrect distribution-based assumptions ignoring the complex nature of the underlying data and model (Xiao and Wang, 2019; He et al., 2020; Glushkova et al., 2021; Zerva et al., 2022); they are often poorly calibrated (i.e., they predict a confidence level that does not match its error probability; Kuleshov et al. 2018); and they may be computationally too demanding, thus inapplicable to large-scale models (Hu et al., 2023). Conformal prediction (CP; Vovk et al. 2005) has recently emerged as a promising candidate to bypass the issues above: unlike other uncertainty quantification frameworks, it offers statistical guarantees of ground-truth coverage with minimal assumptions. CP methods are model-agnostic and distribution-free, assuming only data exchangeability (as described in \u00a72.3). Moreover, extensions of CP that handle non-exchangeable data have recently been proposed (Gibbs and Candes, 2021; Barber et al., 2023). Popular CP variants are also efficient: they do not require model retraining and can be used online or offline, given an additional relatively small calibration set.1 Finally, equalized variants of CP (Romano et al., 2020) can also reduce biases and unfairness, by distributing coverage evenly across protected attributes. The flexibility and strong statistical guarantees of CP have attracted considerable interest, with an increasing number of publications in computer science.2 It is therefore timely to present a survey of conformal methods for NLP, revealing the 1For most purposes, a reasonable calibration set size is of the order of 1000 samples (Angelopoulos and Bates, 2023). 2The number of arXiv papers in the field of computer science containing the expression \"conformal prediction\" has been steadily rising, from 16 papers in 2018 to 2. 22 y a M ] L C . s c [ v71.02 : v i X r a             \fFigure 1: Survey roadmap: CP variants and their use in NLP applications with examples in the literature. theory and guarantees behind these methods and outlining opportunities and challenges for them to tackle important problems in the field. Scope. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of CP techniques for NLP tasks (Figure 1). After briefly explaining CP and some relevant extensions (\u00a72 and \u00a73), we review direct applications thereof in NLP (\u00a74). Finally, we look at possible threads of future investigation and current open issues concerning the use of CP in NLP (\u00a75). What this survey is not about. This is not a general survey on uncertainty quantification and does not include techniques not based on CP . Comprehensive reviews of uncertainty quantification in NLP were recently  (2023) and Hu et al. (2023).

This might be a good place to start when you are considering which breed of dog you want to dress as for cosplay.  If you already have the look of a certain breed, it will be a head start on your costume.  If you have curly hair you may want to try a Cocker Spaniel or a Poodle. People with straight hair can pull off the look of shiny, short haired dogs like Dobermans and Dalmatians. Thin people could dress as Greyhounds or Whippets. For a tough strong look, try a Bulldog or Pitbull. Cosplay costumes are different from your average halloween costume in that you don\u2019t want to cover yourself in a big dog outfit.  Instead, you want to highlight that you, yourself, are the dog.  Wear some shorts or leggings and a shirt in the color of your breed. You could even choose a full, short skirt or tutu if you are dressing as a poodle or another fun, fluffy dog like a Pomeranian. Add little elements to your outfit to suggest you are a dog.  Try tufts of fur on the shoulders, or spots on your shirt. A popular option for getting an animal look is a Spirit Hood.  These are large, furry hats with long sides which drape down and end in mittens with paws prints on the underside.  This is a great start to a dog costume.  You can also find dog ears on a headband or make your own by gluing felt to a headband. If your hair is long enough to put in pig tails, you can make ears out of your own hair. You will want to focus on painting the nose and mouth of a dog by tracing around the tip of your nose in black, brown or pink paint, depending on your breed.  Also create the dog muzzle between your nose and upper lip using a lighter color.  Here you can add some whiskers.  For a playful look, paint a red or pink tongue over one side of your bottom lip and extending past it to look like your tongue is hanging out.  Outline the tongue with a thin black line. Spotted dogs can paint a big spot around one eye. If you have a Spirit Hood, your front paws are already covered.  If not, it is simple enough to use a pair of mittens, which you can wear on their own or decorate with furry material or felt.  Boots are very common in cosplay.  Find a pair of boots which matches the look of your breed.  Choose a nice sleek, tall boot for a short haired dog. Find a fluffy boot like furry Uggs for a long-haired look. No dog costume is complete without a tail.  Depending on the breed you chose, you may want and thin tail or a fluffy tail.  You can achieve these looks using felt or yarn in the appropriate colors.  For a fluffy tail, cut 10 pieces of yarn 5 inches long and tie them together in the middle to make a sort of tassel.  Make several of these tassels.  Using the string tied around the middle of the tassel, tie these tassels to a longer string which is a little longer than the length of the tail.  Tie this to a belt or use more yarn to wrap around your waist and tie the tail on.  Make a tail out of felt or another material of your choice.   Cut the material five inches wide and the length you would like for your tail.  Roll the material starting with the end of the tail, which should come together at a point, ending at the top, which should be left open.  Sew the edges together to create a long cone shape.  Stuff the tail with cotton stuffing and place a flexible wire in the center if you would like to be able to adjust the shape of the tail.  Sew the top together and sew an additional loop to the top to thread a belt through. The accessories are what will really give your costume personality.  Think of different accessories and props you can add to your costume.  You probably want a collar or at least a necklace of some kind. Wear dog tags and have your name etched into the tag at the pet store. Maybe instead you want to get creative and use a bow tie as a collar to class up your dog costume. Some props you can consider would be a big stick or a dog bone.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 23th, and 40th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [23, 40]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5, "sft": 0.4444444444444444, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_full_length": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Here you can add some whiskers.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"For a playful look, paint a red or pink tongue over one side of your bottom lip and extending past it to look like your tongue is hanging out.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([23], \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([40], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Often times dog owners will choose a breed of dog which looks a lot like them.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"No dog costume is complete without a tail.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Often times dog owners will choose a breed of dog which looks a lot like them.\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"No dog costume is complete without a tail.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([23, 40], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence has more than four tokens. Do not alter the second and ninth sentences:\n\nEveryone has neighbors who are noisy from time to time, and we are generally able to accommodate for this with little difficultly. However, you may have  something big coming up such as a job interview or a change in work schedule, and are worried that your neighbor's noise may become a problem for you.  If this is the case, it's better to be proactive and let your neighbors know ahead of time that you'll need a bit more quiet than normal. For example, in the days before your important event or schedule change, stop by your neighbor's with a plate of homemade cookies and try the following: \u201cHey Sam, I've got final exams all next week, and will need extra quiet time. Would you mind rescheduling your band's practice on those days, or maybe even temporarily moving it to a different location? It would help so much.\u201d While talking to your neighbors directly is probably the most mature strategy, and is often the most effective\u2014particularly if you are able to connect with them personally and get them to sympathize with your predicament\u2014there may be times when you'd feel more comfortable writing them.  If you don't know your neighbors at all or if your schedules don't line up to where you ever see them outside of their home (at the mailbox, in the driveway, etc.), then leaving them a very politely worded note in their mailbox or on their door could be an effective way to alert them to the problem. Make sure that your note explains specifically what the problem is: For example, explain that you can hear their television at 11pm when you are trying to get to sleep, and note that it is loud enough that you can hear all of the dialogue on the program. Be sure to offer a proposed solution in your note: For example, suggest that they reduce the volume by a third, or ask that they move the television to the opposite side of the room, away from your shared wall. In case the situation is not resolved, you should keep a dated copy of the note for your records. Keep in mind that just because you can hear your neighbors, this doesn't automatically mean that they are being too noisy and that you would be justified in asking them to quiet down. Remember that people do have the right to make noise in their own home.  Of course, what one person finds mildly annoying the next will find unbearable\u2014these are somewhat subjective terms. In your effort to decide if you really ought to confront your neighbors, ask yourself whether their noise is significantly interfering with your ability to sleep, work, listen to your own programs, etc. If so, then a conversation probably is called for. If, on the other hand, your only complaint is that you can hear their kids playing in the middle of the afternoon while you are trying to read your novel, your request to make them have their kids knock it off will come off as being overly antagonistic. Perhaps you can just move to a different room or wear earplugs while reading.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 4 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 4}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 2th, and 9th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [2, 9]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.30769230769230765, "sft": 0.25, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"neighbors\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"noise\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"quiet\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"event\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"schedule\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"exams\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"band\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"final\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2], \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([9], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(4, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 9], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Cutting the tongue can be a painful and frightening experience, so help whoever is injured to relax.  Keeping both yourself and the injured calm will help as you treat the injury. Before touching or helping anyone with a cut, you should wash your hands to reduce the chances of infection.  You may also want to use medical gloves when aiding the victim, as blood can carry diseases. By sitting up straight and tipping the mouth and head forward, blood can flow out of the mouth, rather than down the throat.  Swallowing blood can cause vomiting, and sitting up with the head tilted forward will help prevent this. A cut to the tongue will likely produce a lot of bleeding; however, it is the depth and size of the injury you will examine.  If the cut itself is shallow, you can proceed with home treatment.  If the wound is deep or longer than \u00bd an inch, your should seek medical attention. If something has punctured your tongue, it may require professional care. If you suspect foreign material has become lodged in the wound, you need to see a doctor. Use gauze or a clean cloth to apply steady pressure to the injury for about fifteen minutes.  This will help stop the flow of blood.  If you notice blood has soaked through the cloth or gauze, apply more, without removing the original piece. Wrap an ice cube in a clean, thin, cloth.  This will be held against the wounded area to reduce blood flow and prevent pain and swelling.  Hold the ice bundle directly on the wound for no more than three minutes at a time. This can be done up to ten times a day. You may also simply suck on an ice cube or hold one in your mouth.  To make the application of ice more enjoyable, you can try using a popsicle. Apply ice only on the first day of the injury. Make sure both your hands and the cloth are clean. The day after the injury is sustained, you should begin rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution.  This can be done up to six times a day. Rinsing your mouth helps keep the wound clean. If your teeth have not been injured as well, you may continue regular dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth.  Make sure there were no injuries to your teeth before continuing any brushing or flossing.  Do not brush or floss injured or broken teeth. If you have also suffered a dental injury, see a dentist as soon as you can. As the injury heals, you should monitor its progress. Look for any signs that it may not be healing correctly or if another issue is arising.  Seek medical attention if you notice any of the following signs:  If blood flow doesn't stop after ten minutes. If you develop a fever. If the wound is excessively painful. If you notice pus coming from the wound. Chances are that a cut tongue will be sore and sensitive.  For a few days after the tongue is cut, you may want to change what foods your eating.  This can help reduce discomfort and prevent possibly injuring your tongue further.  Avoid eating foods that are hard.  Opt for soft foods instead. Try to avoid foods that are extremely hot or cold. Most cuts to the tongue should heal without trouble.  After first aid and general care has been given, the final step is to simply wait for the injury to heal.  Exactly how long the time it takes to heal will depend on how severe the injury is.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 3th, and 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3, 19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 440 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 440}, "function_call": "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666, "gpt4o": 0.8, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"tongue\", 10, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(440, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(440, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([2, 18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 19], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Put on an old shirt or drape an old towel over your shoulders. Coat your hairline and ear tips with petroleum jelly, then pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. Make sure that your hair is healthy. For best results, deep condition it the night before you bleach it. Purchase a good quality hair bleaching kit that contains bleach and developer. Prepare the bleach in a non-metal bowl according to the kit's instructions.  If you are starting with light brown hair, try a 10 volume developer. If your hair is medium brown, a 20 volume developer might work best for you. If you have dark brown or black hair, use 30 volume with care; it is very strong. to dry hair with a tinting brush starting from the ends. If you need to, divide your hair into 4 sections first. Working quickly, use a tinting brush to apply the bleach all over your hair, starting from the ends and mid-lengths first. Then, go back through your hair, and apply the bleach to the roots.  Never apply bleach starting from the roots. This will cause it to process too fast and may destroy your hair. You can divide your hair into 4 sections first, but you don't have to. How long this takes depends on how dark your hair was to begin with and what volume developer you are using. Look at your hair every 5 minutes; once it reaches a pale blond color, you are ready to wash it out.  Expect to wait anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes. Never leave bleach in your hair for longer than 45 minutes, or you'll destroy your hair. Everyone's hair reacts differently to bleach. Your friend's hair may bleach a lot slower than yours. Rinse the bleach out with cool water first, then apply some shampoo to your hair. Lather your hair up, then rinse the shampoo out. If you want to, you can apply conditioner, but it's best to wait until after the toner. Allow your hair to air dry naturally. It would be best to wait a full 24 hours before you do this, otherwise you'll end up over-processing your hair. Keep in mind that if you have dark brown or black hair, it would be nearly impossible to get it to a platinum blonde color; you will have to settle for darker unicorn hair. If the initial bleaching process made your hair too dry, do not bleach it again. Simply settle for darker unicorn hair. , if your hair ended up with brassy tones. Purchase a hair toner or purple toning shampoo, then apply it to your hair according to the instructions on the bottle. Some need to be used on dry hair while others should be used on wet.  Some hair toners need to be mixed with a developer or white conditioner. Read the instructions to find out. Most hair toners need to sit in your hair for 20 to 30 minutes.  Purple toning shampoos typically need to sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes.  If you have platinum or pale yellow hair, you do not need to tone it. While not absolutely necessary, this is highly recommended. Purchase a deep-conditioning mask meant for damaged, dry, or color-treated hair. Apply it all over your hair, then tuck your hair under a shower cap. Wait for the time recommended on the label, then rinse it out. Some deep conditioners need to sit for only 5 minutes, while others need to sit for 10 to 15 minutes.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.5, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 0.5}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bleach\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27], \"change\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \"change\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}}

There were problems in the water system of the building before. I took care of this problem myself because it was simple. then the electrical system began to fail and I don't understand the electricity business, so I gave the building owner notice, but he passed away. but the big problem broke out 3 months ago. In heavy rain, the roof of the house was very bad and the upper floor of the building became unusable. this was purely a structural problem of the house and as a tenant I had no fault of use. the situation again I gave notice to the landlord. at first he wanted to pass. but when I insisted he came and saw the problem in place. I had a really serious damage and, according to the contract, he had to pay compensation to me and get the roof repaired. he would have to pay a substantial amount for these expenses. he told me that, despite the contract between us, he would not pay anything, that if I wanted to sit, I had to accept the building like this, that the rent rate would increase very much due to the shopping mall to be opened soon, and that I was so stupid that I could almost know that I was sitting for free. the landlords in this neighborhood kept saying how positive the new shopping mall would be. but things did not go as expected by the landlords. The company that made the shopping center went bankrupt due to a serious loan debt. The shopping center construction unfinished passed to the lending bank. The bank did not want to continue to the shopping center construction. due to this event, the rental rates in the neighborhood decreased to lower amounts than before. What did my landlord do? albeit forced to repair the roof, he paid me compensation for my belongings. There was only one requirement to extend the duration of the contract for another 5 years. because he knew perfectly well that when I evacuated this house, maybe 1 or 3 years, he can't rent this place to anyone. How do I know? no one has been sitting in the building next to me for exactly 3 years, but the owner of that building has to pay dues for the site costs.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

Make sure you understand this difference before attempting to write your objective.  Goals are broad and often difficult to measure in an objective sense. They tend to focus on big picture issues. For example, in a college class on child psychology, a goal might be \"Students will learn to appreciate the need for clinical training when dealing with small children.\" While such a goal would obviously inform the more specific educational objectives, it is not specific enough to be an objective itself. Educational objectives are much more specific. They include measurable verbs and criteria for acceptable performance or proficiency regarding a particular subject. For example, \"By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify three theorists whose work on child psychology influenced teaching practices in the US.\" This is a more specific educational objective, based on the educational for the same hypothetical course. In 1956, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom created a framework to classify different types of learning, as well as a hierarchy illustrating different levels of learning. Bloom's Taxonomy is usually used when writing educational objectives.  Bloom identified three domains of learning. The cognitive domain is the domain given the most focus in the world of higher education. Cognitive is the domain used for guidance when writing educational objectives. The cognitive domain focuses on intellectual, scholarly learning and is divided into a hierarchy consisting of six levels. The first level is knowledge, which is the ability to memorize, recite, and recall previously learned materials.  Example: Memorizing multiplication tables. Example: Recalling when the Battle of Hastings occurred.   The second level is comprehension. This means taking the facts you know and demonstrating your understanding through organizing, interpreting, translating, or comparing said facts.  Example: Translating a Japanese sentence into German. Example: Explaining why nuclear technology affected President Reagan's political policies.   The third level is application. This means solving problems by applying your knowledge to a variety of situations.  Example: Using pi to solve various mathematical problems. Example: Using \"please\" to ask for things politely not just with Mom, but other people.   The fourth level is analysis. This means taking the facts you learned and reexamining them so you are able to understand why they are true. You are also expected to find evidence to support new claims or inferences you make during your education.  Example: Understanding the concept of \"fate\" as a predetermined destiny. Example: A ball thrown on the ground falls, a rock thrown on the ground falls...but what happens if they are thrown into water?   The fifth level is synthesis. This means organizing information in a new way and discovering new patterns or alternative ideas, solutions, or theories.  Example: Creating a painting. Example: Putting forth a new idea about subatomic particles.   The sixth level is evaluation. This means gaining the ability to present and defend information and make informed judgments about the opinions of others on a given subject.  Example: Creating a short film humanizing immigrants in your community with commentary on why you believe they deserve respect. Example: Writing an essay on why you believe Hamlet really did not love Ophelia. When writing an educational objective, there are three characteristics that you need to focus on. These help you effectively communicate the intent of your class and teaching style.  Performance is the first characteristic. An object should always state what your students are expected to be able to do by the end of a unit or class.  Condition is the second characteristic. A good educational objective will outline the conditions under which a student is supposed to perform said task. Criterion, the third characteristic, outlines how well a student must perform. That is, the specific expectations that need to be met for their performance to be passing. For example, say you are teaching a nursing class. A good educational objective would be \"By the end of this course, students will be able to draw blood, in typical hospital settings, within a 2 to 3 minute timeframe.\" This outlines the performance, drawing blood, the conditions, typical hospital settings, and the criterion, the task being performed in 2 to 3 minutes.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 44 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 44}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 30 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5714285714285715, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(44, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"]}}}

It's also one of the first symptoms to appear as early as seven days (although usually between 10 \u2013 15 days) after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Often the fever comes and goes randomly. This is thought to be related to the malaria parasites transiently spreading into blood from the liver.  There are at least five types of Plasmodium parasites that infect people, although P. falciparum (mainly in Africa) and P. vivax (mainly in Latin America and Asia) are the most common and deadly. The fever and other initial symptoms may be mild and mimic less serious viral infections, such as the common cold and influenza. Usually symptoms don't appear for about two weeks after being bitten. The other primary symptom of malaria is severe shaking chills with intermittent periods of sweating. Again, shaking chills are typical of many other types of infections, but they are usually more pronounced and severe with malaria. They can cause teeth to chatter and even prevent sleep. When they're severe, the shaking can be mistaken for seizures. The chills from malaria are usually not remedied by blanket cover or by wearing warmer clothes.  Although the primary symptoms of malaria typically begin within a few weeks of being bitten by an infected mosquito, some types of malarial parasites can lie dormant in the body for up to a year or more.  Malarial symptoms are caused by the bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasite into the host's bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver where they lay dormant for a week or two before causing symptoms. Secondary and less specific symptoms of malaria are moderate-to-severe headaches, often combined with mild muscle aches. These secondary symptoms often occur a short while after the above-mentioned primary symptoms as the parasite needs a little more time to proliferate in the liver and spread around the body in the bloodstream. Headaches and muscle aches are also very common with most other infections, as well as from the bites of other insects and spiders.  The bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes are not very noticeable (a small, red, itchy bump), unlike the bites of some other insects and spiders that can cause similar symptoms. The initial headaches of malaria are typically dull in nature (like a tension headache), but as the parasites start to infect and destroy red blood cells, they can become pounding in nature (more like a migraine). The achy pain is usually most noticeable in the leg and back muscles because they are larger, more active and get more of the infected blood. Other non-specific secondary symptoms of malaria are vomiting and diarrhea, multiple times per day. They often occur in combination with each other, which mimics the initial symptoms of food poisoning and other bacterial infections. The main difference is that the vomiting/diarrhea caused by food poisoning fades away within a few days, whereas it can remain for a few weeks with malaria (depending on treatment).  Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea of some bacterial infections, particularly Shigella, there's usually no blood or severe cramping with malaria. Once the primary and secondary symptoms become noticeable, the malaria-causing parasites can be seen under a microscope from a drop of infected blood \u2014 especially if the specimen is stained with Giemsa stain. If the advancing primary and secondary symptoms don't prompt the infected person to seek medical attention and get treatment (which may not be possible in the developing world), then symptoms begin to appear that signify serious injury / damage to the body. When these advanced symptoms of malaria appear, the risk of health complications and death significantly increase.  Confusion, multiple convulsions, coma and neurological impairment indicate brain swelling and injury. Severe anemia, abnormal bleeding, deep labored breathing and respiratory distress indicate advanced blood infection and lung involvement. Jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes) is evidence of liver damage and dysfunction. Kidney failure Liver failure Shock (very low blood pressure) Enlarged spleen\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(580, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 580 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 580}, "function_call": "word_count_check(580, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 22 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5714285714285715, "base": 0.2222222222222222, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_count_check(580, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(600, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(600, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"fever\", 5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(600, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"]}}}

He instilled belief in me about the future of the country. One thing I really admired about Andrew Yang was his concern for my local county and the people that reside within it. He has made every effort to address poverty across county lines and speak to us about the rising opiod epidemic that's sweeping our nation. Not only that, he found ample time to speak about the dangers of climate change that we are currently experiencing today. He began with a very inspiring speech about how it was time to change our country and led us into a discussion about poverty within our city. He spoke about how it was unfair that so many sat within the streets, hungry and poor, while other's indulge on their riches and how that needed to change. He then went on to speak about climate change and how we needed to act today to ensure that our children won't have to deal with a failing planet when it's their turn to lead the world. Rising temperatures have been adding to our sea level which, within the next 50 years, will affect our children and our children's children, which is why we need to work to reduce emissions to have a clean Earth for them in the future. Lastly, he began to speak about how the opiod crisis is even affecting our county and the evidence is mounting that these people need mental treatment instead of constant arrests. They need to be cared for instead of shunned and we need to put ourselves in there places if we are to see exactly what they are going through. He also spoke about the actions of Washington and spoke about how it was important for us to not fall into that trap of hate and bigotry and instead lighten the world with our actions. How instead of shipping Mexican's back to there home country, that we will instead create a pathway to citizenship for these individuals so there kids aren't trapped in the very situation that they were running away from. He also spoke of the importance of culture within America and how that would be going against everything that we stand against. I left his rally feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, but also with a new respect for many of the issues that we face today.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 16 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.8, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(2000, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"]}}}

Alternately, you can wear the puff inverted (sometimes referred to as a \u201ccrown fold\u201d) so that the corners of the loose ends poke out the top of your pocket. Place the pocket square against a flat surface with the upper and lower edges level. Fold the square widthwise across the middle, then again lengthwise from the bottom, leaving only a thin strip exposed at the top. Slide the square into your breast pocket to complete the look.  The square fold is also sometimes known as the Presidential fold. It is generally thought to be the most professional way to wear a pocket square. A square fold will look best with pocket squares in solid colors, or those with neat, subdued patterns like stripes or dots. Set out the pocket square in a diamond shape. Fold it neatly in half from the bottom so that the top and bottom points are aligned. With the resulting triangle, fold the left and right points inward to the center to make the square small enough to slip into your jacket.  Double check that the folded points are perfectly centered\u2014there should be no overlap whatsoever. Be careful not to be too rough with the square as you fit it into your pocket. The one-point fold is one of the quickest and easiest methods of wearing a pocket square. It\u2019s uncomplicated yet sleek enough to be worn in a business setting or for most formal events. Begin with the square lying flat in a diamond shape. Fold the bottom point up at a slight angle so that it ends up in line about an inch beside the top point. Crease both side points over and smooth the square before placing it in your pocket. You should end up with two identical peaks side by side.  This fold can be a bit tricky to get right. You may have to give it a couple test runs to achieve a neat, symmetrical outcome. It will be easier to form natural-looking folds that hold their shape with a soft, flowing fabric like silk. Starting with the square in a diamond shape, fold the bottom point up and slightly over to one side so that it\u2019s positioned just next to the top point. Then, take hold of the squared point on the side you just folded and bring it across to the opposite side of the top point. Tuck the remaining side point behind the other folds and carefully fit the square into your suit pocket.  Folds with three or more points provide an air of suave sophistication that will turn heads at high-profile events. Solid colors and simple patterns tend to work best for multi-point folds. If you\u2019re not careful, a more complex pattern may clash with the intricate design of the fold.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 0.8, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"]}}}

Writing out your ideas, feelings, beliefs, and sexuality may help you organize your thoughts before your conversation. Try answering the following questions to help you iron out what you feel and how you want to approach your mom:  How comfortable are you with your sexuality? Are you still coming to terms with it? Are you still questioning your bisexuality, or are you secure with it? Do you think your mom can help support you emotionally? How so?  How do you feel about coming out to your mom? Are you scared, anxious, or worried at all? If so, why? Do you want your mom to know about your romantic life? Do you feel comfortable telling her if you have a partner of the same gender? Do you feel as though your love life is none of her business? Serious conversations are best done face to face, but if you live far away from your mother, this may be difficult. Consider the best way to break the news to your mom. Take her feelings into consideration. How might she want to deal with this news?  A phone or video call can make this big conversation more personal and intimate. Choose a time when you know your mom is not busy. Just before or after dinner time is usually a good time. If you are worried about your mom's reaction or if you think that it will be too difficult to say what you want to say, you can write a letter or email to your mom. Write the same things that you would say in person. If you can, try to meet her in person to tell her. Before you have the talk with your mother, you may find it helpful to practice. Ask a friend to pretend to be your mother. If you do not feel comfortable discussing your sexuality with anyone, you can talk to yourself in a mirror. Practice starting the conversation, and rehearse what you want to say to your mom. If you're writing a letter, you can ask someone to read over it and give you advice. If this is too personal, however, you can just send it to your mother. There are many LGBT groups that provide mental and emotional support as you prepare to tell your parents. Others who have come out can tell you their stories, and they may be able to prepare you for the talk. You can look for local chapters of:  A campus or school LGBT group GLAAD The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Center Human Rights Campaign Gay Straight Alliance While you cannot predict exactly how your mom might react, you may be able to mentally plan for different outcomes. Think about your mom\u2019s beliefs towards bisexual people. You can ask yourself:  Does she agree with bisexuality? Do you think she will be accepting or angry about you coming out? Is she familiar with what bisexuality is? Will she be confused by your coming out? Do you think she will dismiss or ignore your feelings? Does she have religious or moral beliefs that disagree with bisexuality? If you are financially dependent on your parents and you believe that there is a real risk they will throw you out, you may want to consider waiting to tell your mom until you are independent. This includes situations where you no longer live with your parents but rely on them for tuition, rent, or other living costs. Bisexual people can be successful and happy people, just like people of all other orientations. They make up a valuable and lovable part of the world. Bisexuality is more common than you'd think, and it's as valid as any other orientation. No matter how your mom reacts, you can be a successful and valuable member of society.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 35 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 35}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.5, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(35, \"less than\")"]}}}

However, most existing bilingual data sets are (i) not adequate for their intended uses, (ii) not up-to-date, (iii) apply only to limited domains. Because it's very hard and expensive to create a large scale bilingual dataset with human effort, recently many researchers have turned to automatically mining them from the web. \n\nIf the content of a web page is written in two languages, we call the page a Bilingual Web Page. Many such pages exist in non-English web sites. Most of them have a primary language (usually a non-English language) and a secondary language (usually English). The content in the secondary language is often the translation of some primary language text in the page. \n\nSince bilingual web pages are very common in non-English web sites, mining bilingual data from them should be an important task. However, as far as we know, there is no publication available on mining bilingual sentences directly from bilingual web pages. Most existing methods for mining bilingual sentences from the web, such as (Nie et al., 1999; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Shi et al., 2006), try to mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites first and then extract bilingual sentences from mined parallel documents using sentence alignment methods. \n\nAs to mining term translations from bilingual web pages, Cao et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2008) proposed two different methods to extract term translations based on the observation that authors of many bilingual web pages, especially those whose primary language is Chinese, Japanese or Korean, sometimes annotate terms with their English translations inside a pair of parentheses, like \u201cc1c2...cn(e1 e2...em)\u201d (c1c2...cn is a primary language term and e1 e2...em is its English translation). Actually, in addition to the parenthesis pattern, there is another interesting phenomenon that in many bilingual web pages bilingual data appear collectively and follow similar surface patterns. Figure 1 shows an excerpt of a page which introduces different kinds of dogs. The page provides a list of dog names in both English and Chinese. Note that those bilingual names do not follow the parenthesis pattern. However, most of them are identically formatted as: \u201c{Number}\u3002{English name}{Chinese name}{EndOfLine}\u201d. One exceptional pair (\u201c1.Alaskan Malamute \u554a\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u96ea\u6a47\u72ac\u201d) differs only slightly. Furthermore, there are also many pages containing consistently formatted bilingual sentences (see Figure 2). The page lists the (claimed) 200 most common oral sentences in English and their Chinese translations to facilitate English learning. \n\nPeople create such web pages for various reasons. Some online stores list their products in two languages to make them understandable to foreigners. Some pages aim to help readers with foreign language learning. And in some pages where foreign names or technical terms are mentioned, the authors provide the translations for disambiguation. For easy reference, from now on we will call pages which contain many consistently formatted translation pairs Collective Bilingual Pages. \n\nAccording to our estimation, at least tens of millions of collective bilingual pages exist in Chinese web sites. Most importantly, each such page usually contains a large amount of bilingual data. This shows the great potential of bilingual data mining. However, the mining task is not straightforward, for the following reasons: \n1) the patterns vary in different pages, so it'\u201fs impossible to mine the translation pairs using predefined templates; \n2) some pages contain consistently formatted texts in two languages, but they are not translation pairs; and \n3) not all translations in a collective bilingual page necessarily follow an exactly consistent format. As shown in Figure 1, the ten translation pairs are supposed to follow the same pattern;, however, due to typos, the pattern of the first pair is slightly different. \n\nBecause of these difficulties, simply using a classifier to extract translation pairs from adjacent bilingual texts in a collective bilingual page may not achieve satisfactory results. Therefore in this paper, we propose a pattern-based approach: learning patterns adaptively from collective bilingual pages instead of using the parenthesis pattern, then using the learned patterns to extract translation pairs from corresponding web pages. Specifically, our approach contains four steps: \n1) preprocessing: parse the web page into a DOM tree and segment the inner text of each node into snippets; \n2) seed mining: identify potential translation pairs (seeds) using an alignment model which takes both translation and transliteration into consideration; \n3) pattern learning: learn generalized patterns with the identified seeds; and \n4) pattern- based mining: extract all bilingual data in the page using the learnt patterns. Let us take mining bilingual data from the text shown in Figure 1 as an example. Our method identifies \u201cBoxer \u62f3\u5e08\u201d and \u201cEskimo Dog \u7231\u65af\u57fa\u6469\u72ac\u201d as two potential translation pairs based on a dictionary and a transliteration model (Step 2 above). Then, we learn a generalized pattern that both pairs follow as \u201c{BulletNumber}{Punctuation}{English term}{Chinese term}{EndOfLine}\u201d, (Step 3 above).

Whether these two can complement each other, how LLMs and KGs can be effectively integrated, and the question of whether future research should focus on KG assisting LLMs or vice versa remain unanswered. To advance research on the amalgamation of knowledge graphs and large models, we initiated the TechGPT-1.0 and TechGPT-2.0 projects. These projects encompass the release of three 7B-scale instruction fine-tuning models and a QLoRA model tailored for long texts. The extensive models developed within the TechGPT-1.0 and TechGPT-2.0 projects concentrate primarily on diverse subtasks related to constructing knowledge graphs, including tasks like NER and RTE. Furthermore, we will furnish comprehensive insights into data collection and processing, share experiences in debugging the Ascend server, and delineate our model training procedures. This information aims to serve as a valuable reference and support for researchers seeking to train large-scale language models on the Ascend server. Specifically, experienced researchers in our research group curated batches of knowledge graphs to construct datasets for subtasks such as NER and RTE. These datasets were subsequently modified to align with instructions and fine-tune the data format. Notably, the knowledge graph employed for constructing the subtask dataset encompasses open-source 1* The  2Our code is available at  3Model weights are available at  and  co/neukg/TechGPT-2.0-atom-hf             \fTechGPT-2.0: A large language model project to solve the task of knowledge graph construction data collected from public datasets, alongside research data accumulated in previous projects of our research group. This data undergoes collation and manual annotation by our group\u2019s researchers. To ensure the sustained general ability of the large language model during the complete fine-tuning process, we adhere to conclusions drawn from prior experiments. A substantial volume of general instruction fine-tuning data is compiled, and this is amalgamated with knowledge graph domain data in appropriate proportions, resulting in an approximate 4 million instances of instruction fine-tuning data. Additionally, significant disparities exist between the model training process on the Ascend server and traditional NVIDIA graphics cards. Our intention is to share insights into the unique challenges and practices related to model training on the Ascend server, offering valuable guidance for researchers contemplating exploration on this platform in the future. Owing to limitations in our server resources, detailed experiments on the models within the TechGPT-1.0 and TechGPT2.0 projects were not pursued. Consequently, this report provides only concise summaries of straightforward experimental outcomes.

We had spent about five hours in the late afternoon looking before it got dark and we decided to head home. We were driving thru a town next to the park called 29 Palms that has a marine base in it when we saw a UFO from the car! It was a long bright light in the sky that was out in the desert. We pulled over and started to film the object and talk about what it was. It didn't seem to move much in the air and didn't seem far away. My Girlfriend was driving and figured we might be able to get closer to it (we were about a mile away) so we drove down some streets to get to it. We were able to drive right up too it and film it for about 25 minutes. The light looked like a long glowing ribbon in the sky that made no noise. It was very windy but was able to control itself against the wind and would lift up into the sky a few hundred feet and come back down less then one hundred feet about our heads. Many other people started to stop and see the UFO. After close to 30 minutes since we originally saw the object it started to move away from up and against the wind making us get back in our cars and drive another street over to it. As we pulled up we saw the item come down to the ground and turn off. Myself, my Friend and 9 other people that stopped to see the UFO all ran out of our cars and into the desert to look for it, but we couldn't find it at all. We couldn't figure out where it went or what it was. The most likely explanation was it was a light up tail of a kite or a rope on a drone but it made no noise so drone is out, if it's a kite where was the guy holding it? They had to have seen all these people stopped on the side of the road looking and running into the desert to find it. There are some powerlines that cross between where we stood under the object and where it came down so that's not safe and how did it not get stuck? I have tried looking for the object online but can't find anyone selling anything similar to it and the videos online do not look like my video or the object we saw. On the drive home I uploaded the video I took of the UFO, now most of my videos are of animals so this one was a little out of place but by morning had thousands of people emailing, messaging,  commenting on the video asking questions trying to figure it out. A number of large UFO and paranormal Youtubers reached out to me to use the footage on their shows and podcasts!

The interaction with LLMs is through natural language, which on the one hand makes it easy to capture people\u2019s attention and imagination, while on the other hand, makes it also easier for people to draw conclusions or opinions of LLMs that is not properly informed by the underlying machine learning principles. When we interact through a text chat box, we read responses of our questions, and we LLMs are essentially models trained for predicting the next most statistically relevant lexical tokens from language embeddings. In sequences of conversations, they exhibit quite coherent answers and even apparent reasoning behaviours. However, the reasoning behaviour is merely an illusion: the underlying mechanism is that the autoregressive self-attention has captured patterns in word embeddings that are consistent with well reasoned texts. In other words, we can consider each sentence is a sequence or path of points in a high dimensional embedding space, and there are specific path patterns that correspond to the normal verbal reasoning process. Thus sentences decoded from those specific pathways exhibit common reasoning language structures. Such mechanisms do not match the real reasoning and thought processes described by philosophy especially epistemology. While epistemology is not perfect and there are still competing factions within epistemology, it is a vastly better             \fUbiComp Companion \u201924, October 5\u20139, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Zhou et al.

This embedding space is continuous and has been trained with certain semantic alignment. Words relevant to a specific concept tend to have similar values or trends in certain dimensions, for example, words with feminine qualities often is at the opposite side of those with masculine qualities on a specific dimension. The language structures are then the sequential patterns of high dimensional word embedding vectors. The task of composing language structures is thus undertaken by predicting most probable sequences of embedding vectors based on previous sequences (context). An interesting example is the LLMs\u2019 apparent lack of math solving capabilities [12]. This can be explained by the previously mentioned mechanism of LLMs. Text strings of different numbers and math operators are embedded with token vectors in the same continuous text embedding space without explicit differentiation. Instead of modelling a simple numerical operation, which can easily be done by neural networks, LLMs taking text tokens will have to learn the common patterns of different numbers of the same operation", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 22 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

You need to learn to recognize the symptoms of having either a low or high price point. This can indicate that you may need to make a change.   Underpricing is often done by companies who want to sell a higher volume, expecting that the customer will assume they're getting a deal, especially in a down economy. Doing this, however, can give the impression that the product is \"cheap,\" not that they're getting their money's worth.  Overpricing may drive your customers elsewhere. Especially when you're trying to get your feet on the ground as your business gets started, it can be tempting to set the price too high. The investment of starting a business can be scary and you'll probably want to start covering costs right away, but consider the customer's point of view. Setting it at a point you'll make money will only work if people are willing to pay for it. Monitor your profits and prices at least monthly. Break down the cost/gains of every product so that you know how each contributes to your overall profitability month-to-month. This can give a clear picture of your money flow.  Talk to your customers and listen to their feedback. Take it to heart. If they enjoy your product but complain about the price, you might consider making a change. Develop a budget plan. Try to focus on a long term strategy that will result in making the business profitable. This might not involve making drastic changes right away, but slowly moving toward an overall goal of profitability. Jumping from selling an iPhone case for $5 to selling one for $12 will undoubtedly lose you customers, even if the price change is right for the business and a smart move. Instead, raise it incrementally and spend time advertising the product's benefits and advantages, as opposed to apologizing for the increase. Treat it as a benefit, rather than an inconvenience.  Sudden increases will look like desperate moves made by a struggling business, which may or may not be true. You want to avoid the impression that you're raising the prices because you need to make more money. Rather, you need to make it seem as if you're raising prices because the product is just that good.  Watch your sales volume immediately after making the change. If the move was too sudden, you'll see a negative change, suggesting that you need to do more to sell the new variation on the product and justify its price. Unless your competition is lowering their price, or you're just not getting the kind of traffic in your business that you need in order to make it profitable, you generally want to avoid lowering prices. Lowering the price may suggest another kind of desperation--that people are avoiding your store. Using promotions for limited periods of time, or coupons that expire, you can help drive customers toward a particular product or service.  Use discount tactics and promotions rather than lowering the price all at once. You can even alter the amount that someone gets for the same price. For example, November is a month of diabetes awareness. During November, you may charge more for sugary drinks and to recoup the cost of charging less on healthy foods. Make sure to the customers about this, as it can help to drive their choices, as well as make them feel better about paying more for something. They will also know that the price changes are limited. Avoid seeming desperate. For example, an empty restaurant may give the impression that the food is not delicious. Especially if it suddenly becomes very cheap, people may feel the product is of inferior quality.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"price\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(1, \"change\")  # Change the first sentence to meet the condition", "keyword_frequency_check(\"price\", 5, \"more than\")  # Check the frequency of the keyword \"price\""]}}}

I wish I did not lie to myself all these years and think him honest in that situation. James has been my only child for these long years and I have cared for him as best as I could. I have worked several jobs to make ends meet and allow him a childhood that was stress free. In fact, he believed us wealthy because of the gentle disguise I held over his eyes. I do hope that he will be happy wherever he ends up. I know not what Florida will bring to him, but it will be an adventure for him nonetheless. I know I sound like I am rambling, but I just do not know how to get my feelings straight about James and my mind is going very fast at the thought of not seeing him for a long while. I take refuge in the thought that I will indeed see him again at Christmas. He has made a promise to return and James always keeps his promises, no matter how small. I always knew he would leave me and move on to his own life, but I did not want it to be true and I thought maybe just not thinking about it would make it go away. That is not right it appears. My thoughts have been on my husband of late as well. I wonder where he has gotten to on the other side. I lost him several years ago when James was a small boy and now I think of him everyday as well. Who would have thought that several years ago I would lose my husband to a disease and now I am losing my son to a move. One of them is one that I know I have to do, but if you would have told me years ago what would happen in my life, I would not believe it. The only person I will have left with James gone is not a person at all. My cat will have to be the replacement for James and those are hard shoes to fill. I am talking too much about myself here. I am very glad for James because he will go to college and met a lot of new people and make a happy life for himself.

I can't even recall how many years ago we started talking about it, dreaming about it, and hoping it would happen. One of our biggest wishes and dreams came true, we bought our first home. For a while, and I mean a while, we had no idea what area we would be looking in. All we knew is that we didn't want to buy a home too far from our family so our son could grow up knowing them. We also wanted our parents to witness him grow in person and not over a video chat hundreds or thousands of miles away. The way it all happened was so crazy and unexpected, I didn't really see it coming. We were renting a very old, run down house that was poorly renovated to be a duplex. The walls were thin, there were leaks and holes on the outside allowing all sorts of wildlife into the attic and crawl spaces. The stairs were so narrow that getting furniture in and out had to be done out of the second floor. We had to get out of there and fast. One day I went to get my haircut and I started talking to the hairdresser that I had only seen once before. I was talking about our need to move and that we didn't want to move too far from where we were. Much to my shock she was actually considering short term renting and selling the home she lived in. I pulled into the driveway and fell in love. It was absolutely perfect. A brick home and a large fenced in yard in the perfect location. I felt like I was dreaming and knew we had to have it. I called my husband and told him I had found our dream home and we needed to make an appointment at the bank to lock in a mortgage. A week later we were sitting down with a woman at the bank, going over our finances, credit scores, and what we could offer as a down payment. We almost didn't make the cut, but they actually approved us for the mortgage loan! It was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. We had finally made it. We were now homeowners and everyone was over the moon with joy and anticipation of moving in and getting settled. I can't believe how lucky we are to own this amazing home.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 16 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "word_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"home\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ensure the output contains fewer than 25 sentences and more than 380 words:\n\nTo ensure the glue you use doesn't cloud the surface of your puzzle, flake, or cause damage, you should use specially intended puzzle glue for gluing your puzzle. This can be bought at most craft and hobby stores. In all, for this project you'll need:  Puzzle glue Paintbrush (or sponge) Parchment paper (or wax paper) Any clear adhesive, like shellac or decoupage glue, can be used to glue your puzzle together, though some glues might leave a cloudy finish or not glue as firmly as puzzle glue. You'll want to work on a level, clear space while gluing your puzzle. Sometimes, glue can seep between puzzle pieces, causing the pieces to stick to your work surface. To prevent this, you should put a layer of parchment paper between your puzzle and the surface on which you're working.  The parchment paper you lay beneath your puzzle should extend several inches beyond its outer edges. If you don't have parchment paper handy, you could also use wax paper to prevent puzzle pieces from sticking to your work surface. If you are able, slide your puzzle over the top of your parchment paper. If this is not possible, you may need to get a thin, stiff piece of card stock to slide underneath your puzzle to help you transfer it to the parchment paper. At this point, your puzzle should be facing picture side up atop your parchment (or wax) paper, and your paper should extend a few inches beyond the outer edges of the puzzle. To ensure an even layer of glue is spread over your puzzle, you should start at the center of the puzzle and work your way to its outer edges. Start with a moderate amount of glue first. You can always add more later, if necessary. Working from the center of the puzzle out will also help prevent you from using too much glue, which can cause unevenness in the glue. Add your glue a little bit at a time and use your paintbrush or sponge to spread your glue from the center to the outer corners of your puzzle. You should only need a thin layer of glue to hold the puzzle pieces together.  Adding too much glue to your puzzle can sometimes cause the pieces to curl when the glue is dried.  Some brands of puzzle glue come with a plastic glue spreader that you can use to distribute your glue over the surface of your puzzle. If you find that a brush or a sponge doesn't work well for spreading glue and if your puzzle glue did not come with a spreader, you may be able to use a plastic spatula to distribute the glue more quickly. However, dried glue can be difficult to remove from your spatula once you are finished. In many cases, when you reach the edges of your puzzle, you'll find that you have some excess glue. Remove this by pushing it off the edges onto the parchment paper with your paintbrush, sponge, or plastic spreader. If you are using a plastic spreader/spatula, you may be able to remove extra glue by scooping it up and wiping it onto a piece of paper towel. Depending your the brand of puzzle glue you have bought, this may only take a few hours or may require an entire night to dry. When waiting for your puzzle to dry, it's best to err on the side of caution. Moving your puzzle too soon can cause wet glue to deform the puzzle pieces. You should check the label instructions for your glue to determine the amount of time your glue needs to dry.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 0.42857142857142855, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"glue\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 4, 7], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"glue\", 5, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"parchment paper\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"wax paper\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"shellac\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"decoupage glue\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"puzzle glue\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 10, 15], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}}}

The output should have more than 420 tokens and no more than 19 sentences:\n\nTransformer-based pre-trained language models (LM) such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2019] and RoBERTa [Liu et al., 2019] have become the standard approach for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, we witness the emergence of models, larger by several orders of magnitude, such as GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019], T-NLG [Rosset, 2020], GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020], and Switch-C [Fedus et al., 2021]. These models advance the state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks such as question answering and text classi\ufb01cation. However, this trend toward bigger models raises several concerns. As the computational and memory resources required to run inference increase with the model\u2019s size, it becomes very expensive and challenging to deploy these models in production environments and on edge devices. Moreover, these large amounts of computational resources incur a steep environmental cost [Strubell et al., 2019]. Model compression of large LM is a growing \ufb01eld of study as a result of these concerns. Weight pruning is a compression method that has been shown to be very effective at reducing the memory footprint of a model [Han et al., 2015, Zhu and Gupta, 2018]. However, weight pruning of large Transformer-based LMs to high sparsity ratios requires specialized pruning methods [Sanh et al., 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.             \f2020, Chen et al., 2020, Gordon et al., 2020, Lagunas et al., 2021]. Moreover, most of the pruning methods require task speci\ufb01c modi\ufb01cations and tuning to produce quality results. Gordon et al. [2020] found that, in terms of accuracy, it does not matter whether BERT is pruned during the pre-training phase or during the transfer learning phase. This suggests that a LM can be pruned once during pre-training and then \ufb01ne-tuned to any downstream task without task-speci\ufb01c tuning. In this paper, we present a new method, Prune Once for All (Prune OFA), that leverages weight pruning and model distillation to produce pre-trained Transformer-based language models with a high sparsity ratio. We apply our method to BERT-Base, BERT-Large and DistilBERT [Sanh et al., 2019] to produce sparse pre-trained models for these model architectures. We then show how these sparse models can be \ufb01ne-tuned to produce task-speci\ufb01c sparse models with minimal accuracy loss for SQuADv1.1 [Rajpurkar et al., 2016] as well as for four tasks from the GLUE Benchmark [Wang et al., 2018]. We also show that it is possible to further compress the models using quantization-aware training to achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of compression-to-accuracy ratio. The main contributions of this work are threefold: 1) We introduce a new architecture-agnostic method of training sparse pre-trained language models. 2) We demonstrate how to \ufb01ne-tune these sparse models on downstream tasks to create sparse and quantized models, removing the burden of pruning and tuning for a speci\ufb01c language task. 3) We publish our compression research library with example scripts to reproduce our work for other architectures, along with our sparse pre-trained models presented in this paper.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 19 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(40, \"more than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"large LM\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Transformer\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 9, 13], \"change\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

Strokes in cats are not always as devastating to the animal as strokes tend to be in humans; however, the event is still serious and requires immediate attention.  You may want to call ahead as you place the cat in its carrier to tell the veterinarian the symptoms you\u2019ve seen as well. If it is at night, you may need to take him to the emergency veterinary hospital. Your vet will ask you some questions to help determine a course of action. They will ask questions about many things involving your cat's behavior, so make sure you pay close attention to your cat. They will ask if your cat could have ingested anything like a plant, a medication, or a poison to cause the symptoms. They might also ask if there was any known trauma like a fall prior to the symptoms. They will ask about any changes in his water or food intake. They will also likely ask if there has been any vomiting, diarrhea, or general lethargy. You will need to know if your cat has had his rabies vaccination recently as well. Your veterinarian may order a blood panel, urinalysis, x-rays, or an ultrasound. These tests can help determining stroke or the underlying conditions that often accompany a stroke in cats (discussed in Part 1). If your vet thinks there might be a serious neurological problem, a veterinarian specializing in neurology may be needed for a consult. The specialist may ask for additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, which can identify a blood clot or area of damage to the brain. These test are done for animals in a similar way to how they are done for humans. In many cases, your cat\u2019s symptoms may resolve after a few days of TLC at home. In some cases, the cat may require hospitalization with the veterinarian. Neurological outcomes can be very difficult to determine. You and your veterinarian will need time to tell exactly what the long lasting effects or conditions might be.  If your cat has motion sickness as a symptom, a medication such as Cerenia is available to manage that. If your cat\u2019s appetite is down, there may be options that increase the appetite such as Mirtazapine. If your cat is having seizures, your veterinarian will likely discuss medical management with anti-seizure medications such as phenobarbital. If the symptoms were actually vestibular disease, the cat may spontaneously recover in a few days. In other situations, the cat may have a sustained head tilt. That may be the only lasting effect while he is otherwise fine. Other cats may continue to have some balance problems. Since the brain is complicated, the full outcome of a neurological event cannot be completely predicted. It may be tough to watch your pet stumble around. Don't worry because they are likely not in pain. Any cat that has had neurological problems should be kept indoors for its safety. You may need to confine the cat to one room for a while after the cat comes home. This is for the cat\u2019s safety, especially if you have other pets in the household that may attack the cat for behaving abnormally. While recovering, you may need to help the cat eat, drink, or go to the litter box. This will depend on the severity of the condition. You may need to pick them up and carry him to the food bowl, to the water dish, or to the litter box. Watch for signs that he is hungry or needs to go to the litter box, such as meowing or general discontent. It will take time to know if if this will be a temporary or a permanent necessity for your cat. While monitoring the cat and noting symptoms, be careful with any children around the cat. If your cat is confused, disoriented, or seizing, then the cat may bite or scratch unintentionally. Keeping children away is the best way to avoid potential injury. With proper nursing and care, some cats recover very well. Even in these situations, the recovery can take anywhere from 2-4 months. Stay patient with the process and remember how much your cat needs you while recovering.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["word_count_check(200, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"]}}}

The revised output should have fewer than 25 sentences, with each sentence containing more than seven words:\n\nYou married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle.  Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc.), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.7499999999999999, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(800, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"S-I-L\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"]}}}

Nursing care is not offered, nor does this kind of facility have legal authority to give skilled nursing care. If a nurse is on staff, the nurse's role is limited to assessment and directing the resident assistants. Some assisted living facilities also have a separate nursing home wing or section, and that requires a different license to be a skilled nursing facility. If there is an emergency, no one will not offer emergency care. It is difficult to care for, or needs frequent treatment for chronic conditions, the assisted living facility may not accept them. A doctor has to verify that they are suitable by signing a form. On top of that, the facility does its own assessment to see if the prospective resident is a fit for their community. No one is watching over your loved one 24/7. Help is available, but your aging parent will not have a personal attendant noting their every move. Someone will check on them daily and if they don't show up for meals, someone will notice. If medications are being given out by the attendant (\"med tech\") every day or more than once a day, that person will notice if something is wrong. They help with basics but should not be expected to diagnose, or offer anything other than exactly the medications on the resident's list. They may ask the nurse to check on a resident. These homes offer an enriched social environment. There are meals in common and a chance to socialize, activities offered, and entertainment of various kinds. Some communities offer classes. Residents have a way to call someone if there is a problem. If they're not feeling well, an assistant can be summoned by either pulling a cord, a call bell, or pressing a button. The proximity of attention to an aging parent's needs is one of the best ways to assuage the worries of adult children. The actual cost of assisted living may not be fully understood when you size up a place under consideration. You may be quoted the price for the rent of the apartment. The cost is usually more than the rent, as your loved one must also pay many other charges.

Each sentence should contain more than three words. Do not alter the 24th sentence:\n\nAre you hoping to change their mind about something? Is there someone else you\u2019re trying to protect? Perhaps you just want to feel more comfortable around them yourself. Before starting a conversation, make sure you know what your goals are in bringing up your concerns.  It\u2019s possible that your goals can\u2019t be achieved. For example, you might wish that a much older relative would stop using a word you find offensive. However, they may be so stuck in their ways that having a conversation isn\u2019t going to yield your desired result. If your goal isn\u2019t achievable, choose one that is. You might not be able to stop your relative from using that word, but you can at least let them know how you feel about it. Choose a time and place when you can both feel comfortable. You should be able to have privacy and not feel rushed. You may want to let them choose the time and place.  Let them know why you\u2019d like to talk to them. You can say, \u201cYou said something the other day that I\u2019d like to talk to you about. Are you up for that?\u201d Let them know that you are assuming the best about them. You can say, \u201cYou said something earlier that I admit I found offensive. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t intend that, but I\u2019d like to talk about it.\u201d If the person is someone you know well and trust, keep that in mind. They  may feel awful knowing that they offended you. If they\u2019re someone whom you don\u2019t know well or don\u2019t trust, keep that in mind, too.  Consider whether the person has any motivation to change their behavior. For example, if their job is at stake, they will likely take this conversation seriously. If they\u2019re unlikely to ever see you again, they may simply brush off your concern. You can use your relationship to the person to help influence them. For example, you could say to a service provider, \u201cI\u2019d like to continue hiring you, but I feel really uncomfortable when I hear that kind of language.\u201d Or to a relative, such as your child, you could say, \u201cI don't feel comfortable being around others when you speak that way.\u201d If the remark was particularly hurtful, tell the person that if it happens again, you will take action. This is generally appropriate when hateful words or slurs are used knowingly.  In a work environment, you can say, \u201cIf I hear that word again, I\u2019m going to have to speak to our supervisor.\u201d In a family context, you can say, \u201cI think I will have to go home if you continue speaking like that.\u201d Just tell them straight forward. We usually overthink things and make the worst of it. Being straight forward does not mean that you should rub it in their face. You just have to say how you feel without gracing your self ego as well as theirs. People always try to tell some indirect stories and it ends up vindicating the other person. Knowing how you feel may help the person understand. They might not understand why what they said is offensive, but knowing that you feel hurt could be enough to help them change their behavior.  Use \u201cI\u201d statements. This means saying, \u201cI felt angry when you used that word to describe our coworker\u201d instead of, \u201cIt was wrong of you to use that word to describe our coworker.\u201d Another example is saying, \u201cI felt embarrassed when you told that joke\u201d instead of, \u201cThat joke wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d Try to express your feelings without getting visibly upset. If the remark was extremely offensive, you may feel panicked or even start to cry. If this happens, that\u2019s okay.

Keep the output under 640 tokens:\n\nMaking significant, positive body changes is both physical and mental. Make sure your body is at top shape so you see the best results.  Schedule time for sleep. People who get fewer than 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night are more likely to carry weight in their mid-section. This will keep you from your goals. Try to set aside the hour before you go to bed to turn off electronics and relax from the day, so that you can get restful sleep. Add a stress reducing activity to your day. When your body feels stress because of work or your personal life, it releases cortisol, which can tell you to pack on pounds on your waist. Try deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or ambient music to reduce anxiety. To increase the loss of body fat and tone your muscles, increase the amount of aerobic/cardio workouts you do. To burn fat, you need to work out 5-6 days a week, and increase your cardio workouts to at least 45 minutes each. Switching from 30 minute workouts to 1 hour workouts can improve your tone and fat loss greatly. Your curves will get more pronounced faster. If you don't have time to do 45-60 minutes at once, break up the time into 2 30-minute workouts. Do a 30 minute workout at the gym and do a speed walking session after dinner. Make sure to have at least 1 workout that is 30 minutes to reap the benefits. High-intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is where you do short bursts of intense work followed by less intense activity or rest. This kind of workout is great for blasting fat away. To do this, warm up, then switch between low/moderate and high intensity for 2 to 4 minutes at a time. For example, try running for as fast as you can for 1 minute (or 15 or 30 seconds to start if you can't run for a minute). Walk for twice that time (2 minutes for 1 minute of running; 1 minute for 30 seconds; 30 seconds for 15 seconds). Repeat 5 times for a fat blasting 15 minute workout. As your fitness improves, run for longer durations, run faster, jog instead of walk to rest, and increase to 30 and 45 minutes. For a curvy body, you want to make sure to balance upper body workouts with lower body workouts. Make each of your workouts different to work different muscle groups for all-around tone and keep your metabolism running high.  Try a class, such as spinning, barre, cardio burn, flow yoga, or boot camp once per week. Workout on a machine, like an elliptical, treadmill, or stair stepper 1 day. You can set these machines for interval workouts. Try other activities like swimming, hiking hills, speed walking, or biking to further break up the routine. Use 30-minute or longer strength training sessions as both cardio and strength training workouts. Use weight machines or hand weights and add them to a 30-minute machine workout. Decrease the time that you rest between sets to keep your heart rate up and your body sweating. To get and maintain a curvy figure, pay attention to your legs and arms while strengthening your core. Another thing to do while strengthening your curves is not to forget the back of your body. Strength train 3 to 4 times per week - basically every other day. Once your cardio exercise burns off excess fat, these exercises will provide hourglass curves.  Do squats to target your glutes and thighs. Always keep your stomach flexed and your spine neutral. Add hand weights for added resistance.  Try step ups to improve your glutes, hips, and thighs. Place a bench in front of you that is at knee height or higher. Place your right foot on the bench. Then, step up onto the bench with your left foot. Lower your left foot and your right foot. Repeat 12 times with each foot leading. Do side steps to improve hips and the outside of the thighs. Do planks. Start out with a half-plank on your knees if you are beginning. When your strength increases, advance to a full body plank. Go for side planks to work your oblique muscles. Do Serratus pushups. This will work the shoulders and chest areas to better support curves in your upper body. Get on your hands and knees. Lower your arms so that you are resting on your elbows. Flex your stomach muscles in and get into a low plank position with your legs out. Squeeze your shoulder blades together for 2 to 5 seconds, then let them go apart. Do this in 2 sets of 10 while breathing slowly in and out. Target your outer thighs with clam shells. Get on your side, resting on your elbow. Place your knees in front of you as you would when you sit in a chair. Open your knees while keeping your heels together. Pause and lower your knees with control until they meet. Do 20 clam shells, and make sure your hips stay stacked so all of the work remains in your thighs.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 8th, and 18th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [8, 18]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 640 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 640}, "function_call": "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo": 0.4, "simpo_iter2": 0.4, "simpo_iter3": 0.5714285714285715}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([8, 18], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(640, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "# Evaluate overall text quality", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(640, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 17], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

Grammar errors of writing could hinder readers to understand it. As a remedy to this problem, grammatical error correction (GEC) has become an important research challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many NLP scholars are interested in GEC in universal languages such as English or Chinese. The low-resource languages, on the other hand, are rarely the topic of research. For low-resource language NLP research, there are very few language resources accessible. This hinders the advancement of low-resource language GEC research and NLP technology. To solve the lack of a sizable annotated corpus, more GEC of low-resource languages are solved though unsupervised systems, because the seq2seq-based supervised system of GEC is more difficult adapted to low-resource languages \u2217Shengyi Jiang and Aimin Yang are co-corresponding authors.

Different from the seq2seq-based system, The current investigations adopt the unsupervised technique to generate training data or develop GEC based on the language model scoring method. A language-modelbased unsupervised GEC is proposed by Bryant and Briscoe [1]. Compare to the most recent neural and machine translation algorithms that rely on large amounts of annotated data, their basic unsupervised systems also achieve competitive results. Lin et al. [11] built the first corpus utilized for Indonesian GEC tasks and constructed an unsupervised GEC benchmark supported by neural network models. However, most of the previous unsupervised GEC methods are applied mainly using traditional language model or neural-based approaches, and to the best of our knowledge, pre-trained language model has not been utilized in this sector. We propose a BERT-based unsupervised GEC framework. The framework regards GEC as the multi-class classification task. It contains three modules: data flow construction module, sentence perplexity scoring module, and error detecting and correcting module. The data flow construction module converts the sentence input to data flow. The sentence perplexity scoring module then scores each converted sentence and uses a scoring mechanism for pseudo-perplexity to evaluate the probable correctness of a sentence. Once errors are found, the sentence is further corrected by the error detection and correction module based on the result of scoring. In addition, we also build a corpus for the research of Tagalog GEC evaluation. We experiment the framework on the Tagalog and open-source Indonesian corpus, which demonstrates that our method achieves better than the state-of-the-art performance. Our framework has the potential to be the new baseline method for low-resource GEC task. The paper makes the following contributions: (1) We construct an evaluation corpus for Tagalog GEC. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GEC corpus for Tagalog. (2) We propose an unsupervised GEC framework. The framework does not depend on any annotated data. (3) We propose a scoring method for pseudo-perplexity. Its goal is to efficiently evaluate the likely validity of a sentence. (4) We conduct experiments on the Tagalog corpus we constructed and open-source Indonesian corpus.

I was just minding my own business, eating breakfast and catching up on work emails. My day started out pleasant enough, as it was early in the day, quiet and peaceful. Then I notice some guy sits at the next booth and I sigh, annoyed that he doesn't seem interested in adhering to the basic social tenet of giving other people space in an otherwise large and empty restaurant. I can see out of the corner of my eye that he keeps turning his head to look back at me, and I brace myself for the inevitable encounter, probably another panhandler or some desperately lonely person looking for any type of social interaction, even with a complete stranger. My second theory turns out to be true, as he repeatedly turns in his seat to talk to me, succeeding in his attempts at insipid small talk while I give terse, disinterested answers. I live in the vain hope that my body language and preoccupation with my phone will eventually discourage him. I go to take a bite out of my breakfast sandwich and he turns around again, offering to buy me breakfast as he watches me chew. I stare at him, befuddled, finish chewing, swallow, and tell him no thank you before turning my attention to my phone, typing pointedly. He turns back, then minutes later turns back to me, and starts telling me a story about buying bread the other day. I have had it. I tell him I'm really not trying to be rude, but I'm just trying to eat my breakfast and take care of some work stuff. I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone, sorry. He recoils, looks offended, and he repeatedly turns in his seat, then back at me petulantly, ranting about how he was just trying to be nice, he was just talking to me, I can't even be decent enough to talk to him? Because apparently I owe him conversation. I explain to him that I don't really care and to leave me alone. I can see a couple employees of the restaurant had sat down at one point, on break and/or checking in to see what was going on. I can see them watching quietly, trying to see if this escalates to the point where they need to intercede...again. Because this is not the first time something like this has happened to me at this place. That's right, this is the second time in the last six months or so that I've gotten into an argument with a man who wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. Apparently, he's had his fill, because he scrambles out of the booth, grabs his backpack, and starts retreating to the exit across the building. Again, he turns to walk away, stops, turns back to me, turns to walk away, turns back, rinse, repeat. As he does this little dance, he peppers in accusations of my being mentally ill, my needing to see a psychiatrist, oh, and also racist invective and the classic demand that I go back to where I came from. And the day started out so nicely.

Compared to the traditional neural network methods, transformer models achieve not only lower error rates but also reduce the training time required on down streaming tasks, which makes them easier to be used by a wide range of applications. However, most languages (especially the low-resource languages) in the world have limited available corpora [8] to train language-speci\ufb01c transformer models [5] from scratch. Training such a model from scratch can also be quite expensive in terms of computational power used [9]. Thus, the similar explosion of state-of-the-art NLP models than in English language has not been materialized for many other languages. Then, naturally, we would like to \ufb01nd a way how to push these NLP models for multiple languages in a cost-effective manner. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed multilingual transformer models such as mBERT [6] and XLM [10]. These models share a common vocabulary of multiple languages and pre-trained on a large text corpus of the given set of languages tokenized using the shared vocabulary. The multilingual transformer models have helped to push the state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual NLP tasks [6, 10, 11]. However, most multilingual models have performance trade-off between low and high-resource languages [11]. High-resource languages dominate the performance of such models, but it usually underperforms when compared to the monolingual models [12, 13]. Moreover, only \u223c100 languages are used for pre-training such models, which can be ineffective for other unrepresented languages [13]. It was hypothesized in [14] that the lexical overlap between different languages has a negligible role while the structural similarities, like morphology and word order, among languages to have a crucial role in cross-lingual success. In this work, our approach is to transfer a monolingual transformer model into a new target language. We transfer the source model at the lexical level by learning the target language\u2019s token embeddings. Our work provides additional evidence that strong monolingual representations are a useful initialization for cross-lingual transfer in line with [15]. We show that monolingual models on language A can learn about language B without any shared vocabulary or shared pretraining data. This gives us new insights on using transformer models trained on single language to be \ufb01ne-tuned using a labeled dataset of new unseen target languages. Furthermore, this helps the low-resource languages to use a monolingual transformer model pre-trained with high-resource language\u2019s text corpus. By using this approach, we can eliminate the cost of pre-training a new transformer model from scratch. Moreover, we empirically examined the ability of BERT, mBERT, and XLNet to generalize on a new target language. Based on our experiments, XLNet model can generalize more on new target languages.

Besides the improved quality over traditional classification algorithms, LLMs are mainly successful in RE because they do not need extensive datasets to be trained. RE researchers and practitioners have been limited for a long time by the scarcity of high-quality data for specific RE tasks. Early studies on deep learning for RE tasks have shown that simple tasks such as binary requirements classification could only be solved effectively with labeled datasets of sizes larger than 10,000             \f2 A. Vogelsang and J. Fischbach entries [32]. With the rise of LLMs and especially the distribution of pre-trained models, RE researchers can adapt the models to certain domains and tasks with only a few additional and specific data [16]. LLMs belong to an active research field with many more active researchers than the field of Requirements Engineering. RE researchers and practitioners can profit from the recent advances in models and their accessibility. Examples of RE tasks that have been successfully (semi-)automated include requirements classification [16], requirements tracing [19], test case derivation [12], or requirements completion [21]. On the other hand, RE researchers need to stay on top of the development of modern NLP techniques and be able to decide and assess which improvements may help them solve RE tasks. Adopting LLMs in RE marks a significant milestone in the quest for automation and quality enhancement within the domain. However, amid the enthusiasm surrounding their efficacy, the selection of suitable LLM architectures and the nuanced process of fine-tuning them to meet the specific demands of RE tasks remains challenging. This challenge is multifaceted, rooted in the complexity of LLM architectures and compounded by the intricate nature of RE requirements. LLMs encompass various architectures, each tailored to address different facets of natural language understanding and generation. From encoder-only models like BERT to generative models like GPT, the landscape of LLMs is vast and continually evolving. Consequently, RE researchers and practitioners are confronted with the daunting task of discerning which architecture aligns best with the intricacies of their respective tasks. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs to optimize performance for RE tasks requires a delicate balance between general language comprehension and domain-specific adaptation. Unlike generic NLP tasks, RE demands a nuanced understanding of domain-specific jargon, context, and semantic nuances. Thus, the fine-tuning process necessitates meticulous calibration to preserve the fidelity of the model\u2019s pre-trained knowledge while tailoring it to the idiosyncrasies of RE requirements. This chapter aims to provide RE researchers and practitioners with a fundamental understanding of what LLMs are and how they work (see Section 2). Moreover, we show three fundamentally different ways of working with LLMs to solve RE tasks (see Section 3). We close the chapter with a summary and concluding remarks (see Section 4).", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 13th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 13]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8571428571428571, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.5714285714285715}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

A simple online search using a term such as \"Which cultures do not use wedding rings\" will give you quite a few returns.  In some cases in India, a bride and groom will put the emphasis on having a big wedding rather than on having rings\u2013\u2013then the whole town, and more, know that you are married. In these conditions, why do you need a ring? (That said, wealthier Indians do tend to make the ring part of the wedding commitment, as part of adopting Western wedding traditions.) The Amish receive a clasped hand blessing as part of their ceremony but do not wear an outward symbol of their union, especially not jewelry. Some communities do use different dresses or colors, or long beards, to symbolize married couples though. Would you be more comfortable with a chain around the neck symbolizing your love? Chains, just like rings, are also a symbol of attachment/commitment. You and your partner don't even need to wear the same \"type\" of jewelry, as long as the two pieces have something in common (text, style, little sign). For those who undertake a lot of manual or mechanical labor, wearing the ring around a necklace is often considered a preferred (and safer) option. What about getting a tattoo? Maybe you'll think: \"I don't have tattoos, I'm not a tattoo person\" but this reason makes it different. In general, you do not want tattoos because you think that your tastes will change. But don't your wish your marriage to last  forever? The tattoo doesn't have to be fancy. It can be your lover's name on some discreet part of your body: around the ring finger, on your side, or why not hidden under your hair, like a secret? Be creative. Nobody has to see it. It's just for you and your lover.  The infinite symbol is a popular tattoo for married people to use. Instead of a tattoo, consider a second piercing, either in the ear or somewhere else prominent. When people ask about it, you can proudly proclaim it's because you're married! Make something using your own creativity that expresses your commitment. For example, it might be a small booklet of the 10 Reasons I Love You, or a heart shaped craft item or a photo album of the two of you having good times together. Really, the sky is the limit on how to personalize this aspect and it's entirely up to you as to how to turn it into a marriage commitment token. Display it proudly in your home where people visiting will see it. If the original license is not so flash, in some countries, you can upgrade to a prettier official document than the regular signed ones for a small fee; whether or not this is needed or can be done depends on where you get married. Rings are not the marriage. Marriage is about the effort of maintaining an intimate relationship and being there for one another through thick and thin. One way you can make a commitment statement is to promise one another to reaffirm your love for each other on each anniversary of your wedding, using words, poetry, images, or some other self-created way that requires personal effort to restate what you love about your partner. You could even make this reaffirmation public by throwing a small party at home or simply having a few friends and/or family over to witness your reaffirmation. Some couples even like to renew vows as if they're having a wedding all over again, perhaps at long intervals such as each decade or on specific long-term anniversaries.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 32th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [32]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3333333333333333, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.8571428571428571}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check(32, \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"equal\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"]}}}

This shift can be attributed to pivotal milestones such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), which replaced feature engineering methods with deep learningFurthermore, based representation learning. the emergence of pre-trained transformer-based models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and BART (Lewis et al., 2019) has led to the development of contextualized word embeddings with ELMo (Peters et al., 1802) Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of models with parameter sizes exceeding a hundred billion, such as GPT-3 (Rae et al., 2021), which are pre-trained on massive datasets. However, there is a scarcity of research focusing on LLMs architectures within specialized domains characterized by limited resources. A range of approaches for developing language models exists to address the issue of limited language resources, including simultaneous pretraining with in-domain data (Wada et al., 2020) and domain-adaptive pretraining by \ufb01ne-tuning an existing generic language model with in-domain data (Gururangan et al., 2020). The choice of pre-training technique depends on the speci\ufb01c task data and available resources, but determining the optimal utilization of limited clinical task data in pretraining and selecting the most suitable data for pretraining methods remain open questions. This study aims to assess and contrast different techniques using a limited task corpus for pretraining BERT models in the Turkish clinical domain, which is low-resource settings. This work introduces four pretrained language models for the clinical domain in the Turkish language. These models explore the effects of different corpus selections combining small task-related corpus and pretraining strategies in the Turkish clinical domain. We also created a labeled dataset for multi-label classi\ufb01cation using             \fhead CT radiology reports to evaluate the models. The main contributions can be listed as: \u2022 While simultaneous pretraining has previously been explored with limited biomedical literature data in the work of (Wada et al., 2020), our study shifts the focus towards applying this approach to limited clinical Turkish radiology data for the \ufb01rst time. We conducted an evaluation of simultaneous pretraining, incorporating limited clinical task radiology data, and compared it with taskadaptive pretraining through continual pretraining. This novel comparison provides valuable insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of these methods in the context of limited clinical radiology data, highlighting their potential in specialized domains. \u2022 We created small task-related corpora, including Turkish head CT radiology reports by Ege University Hospital. Then, we built four pretrained clinical language models, for the \ufb01rst time, using Turkish head CT radiology reports, Turkish general corpus and Turkish biomedical corpara including Turkish medical articles (T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2022), Turkish radiology theses (T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2022). \u2022 We developed a multi-label classi\ufb01cation task aimed at identifying the presence or absence of 12 clinically signi\ufb01cant observations, as well as a \"no \ufb01ndings\" label indicating no observations, within head CT radiology reports for the purpose of evaluating language models. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing multi-label text classi\ufb01cation studies in the Turkish clinical domain.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 17 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 3th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"]}}}

Place the desktop on its side somewhere that gives you easy access. Lay it down with the ports on the back closest to the table. Some cases have thumbscrews for easy opening, while older cases typically require a Phillips head screwdriver. Slide the panel off or pull it open after removing the screws. Make sure to remove the panel that allows access to the motherboard. You can determine which panel to remove by looking for the I/O ports on the back of the computer. These ports include monitor, Ethernet, speaker, USB, and more. They are connected to the motherboard, so remove the panel on the opposite side. Anytime you work inside a computer, you risk emitting an electrostatic discharge that could damage your components. You can reduce this risk by wearing an anti-static wriststrap, or by grounding yourself before working in the computer. Touching a metal water tap will ground you. If you are replacing RAM, pop out the old modules by pressing down on the latches on each end of the module. The RAM module should pop out of the slot, allowing you to lift it directly out. Many motherboards have four slots for RAM, but pairs are typically not installed directly next to each other. For example, the slots may be laid out as A1, B1, A2, B2 and you would install your first pair on A1 and B1. Refer to your motherboard documentation to ensure that you know which slots to use. If you don't have your documentation handy, you can often tell which slots are pairs by looking at the coloring. They may be labeled on the edge, which each label etched onto the motherboard. These labels may be small, so you may have to look closely. Push each module directly into the slot, ensuring that the notches at the bottom line up. Apply even pressure directly to the top of the module until it is inserted and the latches snap into place on each side. Do not force the modules in or you may break them. Nearly all RAM is installed in pairs. Some computers will have difficulty with a single RAM stick, and using only one stick will decrease performance.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/28\\/Add-RAM-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Add-RAM-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/28\\/Add-RAM-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1606556-v4-728px-Add-RAM-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"485\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} With the RAM installed, close up your computer and screw the case panel back into place.

Using machine learning techniques to create or process knowledge graphs is a well researched topic that receives new momentum. The report of the Dagstuhl Seminar 22372 [2] and the Knowledge Base Construction from Pretrained Language Models (LM-KBC) Challenge2 emphasize the relevance of this topic. Pan et al. [3] outline the potential of connecting LLMs and KGs and in particular with \u201cLLM-augmented KGs\u201d. RDF - the Resource Description Framework - serves as a standard for representing Knowledge Graphs, while Turtle, a textual representation, is widely used to store and exchange RDF data. We have opted for Turtle given its strong resemblance to natural language, which aligns well with the primary mode of interaction with LLMs. In previous works, we have conducted manual experiments [4] and introduced the framework LLM-KG-Bench [5] for automated benchmarking of LLM performance on KGE tasks. In this paper, we expand upon that work by introducing two new tasks to the LLM-KG-Bench framework and evaluate the ability of various models to shed light on the question \u201chow well do LLMs speak Turtle\u201d, i.e. parse, comprehend, analyze, create and serialize RDF knowledge graphs using Turtle serialization. Besides Claude 1.3-100k, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, we also include Claude 2 in our evaluation and have extended the framework\u2019s capabilities to allow for benchmarking on a variety of freely available offline LLM models using GPT4All. We have selected GPT4All Vicuna as a non-commercially usable model and Falcon 13B as the top freely available commercially usable model (Apache 2.0 license) to be additionally included.

Next time you have to go to the doctor, the dentist, or make some other kind of appointment, make sure you schedule it for the day and the time of the class you hate the most, so you'll be able to miss it. You won't have to sneak around if it's for real. If your parent usually schedules appointments for you, go ahead and do it yourself before they give you the chance to go back out to the waiting room. Then make like everything's already taken care of. In middle and high school, some teachers will write up passes for students to work on group projects in their classroom, especially during study hall, or other break periods, if the project is especially important. In some cases, you might be able to convince one teacher that your break period is actually during another time than it actually is, and get them to write a pass for you to leave the class you don't like. Then just leave. This can be dangerous, if you have teachers who talk a lot. Try to get teachers from different departments, like a shop teacher and a math teacher, who may not be likely to communicate with one another. Depending on the class you're trying to get out of, you may have a more legitimate reason to leave than you originally thought. If you're annoying about being in a particular class, tell your teacher that you do better work in the library, and ask if you can go study there instead some day. Teachers are likely to be surprised by this, and you might win a free hour in the library, without having to beat around the bush about it. If you're upset about something, or if you feel like you need to be missing class for a more serious reason, ask to go talk to the guidance counsellor. It doesn't have to be anything big: maybe you're just feeling stressed about school and about your ability to handle the pressure. That's what guidance counsellors are there for.  Tell your teacher that you're really upset, but be vague. Talk quietly and seriously, right before class, and ask if they'll allow you to go talk to the guidance counsellor instead of coming to class today. If you have to come up with an excuse, try to think of something they'll be unable to verify. No dead grandmothers. Try something like, \"I think I might be having a panic attack,\" instead. Maybe you've got strict parents, but you never know until you ask. If you've got a real bummer of a class period coming up, ask one of your more lenient parents if they'll call you out for a class period sometime. You might get lucky once or twice.  Sometime, try doing a little research by asking one or both of your parents if they ever cut class when they were younger. Dig up some good stories, then use this for leverage later. If you find out your dad used to cut all the time because his math teacher was totally boring, start playing up how dull your math teacher is, and how you wish you could just come home and spend time cleaning up instead of going to class.

Remove all dangerous or sharp objects from the room and fill the space with safe toys. Set the room or space apart from the rest of the house by securing it with a baby gate. The kitchen can be very dangerous to your child because it is filled with this that can burn, cut or injure your toddler. To prevent your child from getting into the kitchen, put a baby gate in the doorway of the kitchen to keep your child out. Having a gate can also be useful because you can work in the kitchen and keep an eye on your child in the next room, as baby gates keep you from having to shut the kitchen door. Give your child a toy that is adapted to your child\u2019s specific age. In particular, look for soft toys that don\u2019t have any small parts that could break off. The toy should also be free of sharp parts that could cut your child. If your child were to knock something over, like a vase, that shatters, your child could get cut. Because of this, it is important to remove breakable objects from the reach of your child. If you put the breakable objects out of reach of your child, make sure that they are on a stable surface that your child cannot move. For example, if the vase were put on a table that could be moved around easily, your child might lean on the table and accidentally cause the vase to fall and shatter. Instead, put the vase on something sturdy. Chemicals can be very dangerous because your child could swallow them, and some can be very toxic. Household products often contain sulfuric and phosphoric acid, chlorine, ammonia, formaldehyde and phenol. To keep these chemicals out of the reach of your child:  Close the door of the room containing the chemicals. If you cannot close the door for some reason, make sure you put all the chemicals out of the reach your children. Paints and varnishes can also be extremely toxic and should be kept away from children or avoided. There are some household plants that can actually be toxic if eaten. Because of this, it is important to make sure that all of your houseplants are not toxic, in case your toddler decides to chew on a leaf. Some of these toxic household plants include:  Aloe Vera, Burn Plant, Chrysanthemums, Cyclamen, Heart leaf philodendron, Philodendron, and Azaleas. Additionally, do not use stones as decorations because your child could try to eat the stones, or could fall and injure him or herself on the stones. Put a fence or grate around the fireplace and put padding on all the sharp edges and corners. If your child tends to play near the fireplace, you may want to consider not using the fireplace until the child has grown up a bit and knows not to go near or try to touch the fire. An often overlooked source of poisoning is the over-the-counter medications or prescriptions that some women keep in their purses for when they are away from home. Adult strength medications can be very detrimental to the small body of a toddler. Toddlers should never be allowed to play with purses, even though it may seem cute, because one person\u2019s purse might be full of safe things for a toddler to play with, but someone else\u2019s might not be.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(40, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"play\", 5, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"]}}}

When you are first start training him, keep the sessions short, around five minutes. You should also start with one command at a time until he learns it. Then move on to another command.  Repeat these sessions three times a day as you are training him. You can increase the time of these sessions as he gets older. The first lesson that your puppy should learn is 'no' or 'stop'. It will be easier for your to pick one or the other, since they basically mean the same thing and your dog will not know the meaning until you teach him. Make sure you are always firm with this command, though you should never hit him.  When you see your puppy doing something he shouldn't, tell him 'no' or 'stop'. Then pull him away from the activity and tell him again. Keep repeating this command every time he does something he isn't supposed to until he obeys you consistently. Your puppy with start to explore the things around him through his mouth. This means that he will try to chew and bite everything. When you are playing with you puppy and he goes to bite or chew on you, tell him 'no bite'. After you say this, give him a chew toy to chew on instead. This will help him associate this behavior with the toys instead of your fingers.  Do the same thing if you find him chewing objects he shouldn't, such as shoes or furniture, by saying 'no chew'. Repeat until he does this consistently. One helpful command to teach your puppy is 'sit'. To start off, stand in front of your puppy with a treat in your hand that he can see. Firmly tell him to 'sit', then push his bottom down until he is sitting. Once he is there, give him the treat and praise him.  Turn away from your puppy and let him stand back up. Then, turn back to him and tell him to sit. If he doesn't, repeat the command and push his bottom down gently. Keep doing this until he can do it on his own without your help consistently. This command works well to stop her from jumping as well. Use a leash or your hands to gently pull him back, then give him the sit command and a tasty treat when he complies. He will soon learn that he shouldn't jump. Once he has mastered many of the other commands, you can teach your dog to lay down. You can either say 'down' or 'lay down' for this command. To start, stand or sit facing your dog with a treat in your hand he can see. Tell him 'down' or 'lay down' as you move your hand with the treat down towards the floor. As he starts to lay down, even if it is only a little bit, give him the treat and praise him. Keep trying until he lies down completely on the floor consistently. The 'stay' command is one of the best to help with your puppy's safety. When your puppy is sitting in front of you, hold your hand in front of his face as wide as you can and firmly say 'stay'. Start backing away slowly. If he starts coming towards you, command him to sit again and give him praise. Then repeat the process until he stays on his own, then praise him and give him a treat. Keep doing this until he learns to stay all the time, even if you go far away and tell him to 'stay'. Another command that can help your dog stay safe is 'come'. Start out slow while you are playing in the yard. Lean down and slap your thighs, saying 'come' in a friendly voice. He will think you want to play, so he will come running to you. Give him a treat a praise.  Repeat this command at different times, especially when your puppy may be distracted by a toy, another dog, or another human. Repeat the command and praise him when he comes to you. You can also try using one of his favorite toys to entice him to you in the beginning. This command helps you stop your dog from barking at the wrong times. Keep a bag of treats handy for when he starts barking. When he does, look at him with a treat in your hand and say 'quiet'. As soon as he stops barking, give him the treat and praise. If he doesn't stop right away, show him the treat to try to get him to stop. Then repeat until he stops as soon as you say the command. As your dog ages, make sure to keep his training steady. Even after he learns all the commands, play with him and call out random commands. When he does as he is told, give him praise and treats. This will keep him sharp and make him a better, more well-behaved dog as he ages.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 55 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 55}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 4 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 4}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"better\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50], \"change\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(55, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(4, \"more than\")"]}}}

Though mathematically quite simple, spectral clustering can easily adapt to nonconvex geometries and accurately separate various non-intersecting shapes. As a result, it has been successfully applied to many practical tasks, e.g., image segmentation (Shi and Malik, 2000) and document clustering (Dhillon, 2001), often significantly outperforming traditional methods (such as k-means). Furthermore, spectral clustering has a very rich theory (von Luxburg, 2007), with interesting connections to kernel k-means (Dhillon et al., 2004), random walk (Meila and Shi, 2001), graph cut (Shi and Malik, 2000) (and the underlying spectral graph theory (Chung, 1996)), and matrix perturbation analysis (Ng et al., 2001). \n\nHowever, spectral clustering is known to suffer from a high computational cost associated with the n x n matrix W, especially when n is large. Consequently, there has been considerable effort to develop fast, approximate algorithms that can handle large data sets (Fowlkes et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2009; Sakai and Imiya, 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Chen and Cai, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Tasdemir, 2012; Choromanska et al., 2013; Cai and Chen, 2015; Moazzen and Tasdemir, 2016; Chen, 2018). Interestingly, a considerable fraction of them use a landmark set to help reduce the computational complexity of spectral clustering Specifically, they first find a small set of data representatives (called landmarks), [MATH] (with [MATH]), from the given data in X and then form an affinity matrix between X and Y (see Fig. 1): [MATH] \n\nAfterwards, different scalable methods use the matrix A in different ways to cluster the given data. For example, the column-sampling spectral clustering (cSPEC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2009) regards A as a column-reduced version of W and correspondingly use the left singular vectors of A to approximate the eigenvectors of W. However, they seem to consider only unnormalized spectral clustering, and it is unclear how they extend their technique to normalized spectral clustering (Shi and Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2001). Another example is the landmark-based spectral clustering (LSC) algorithm (Cai and Chen, 2015) which uses a row-sparsified version of the matrix A as approximate sparse representations of the input data while bypassing the expensive dictionary learning and sparse coding tasks. It then applies the L1 normalization to each row of A, followed by a square-root L1 column normalization. This method empirically works quite well but clearly there is a gap between its sparse- coding motivation and the actual implementation. A third example is the k-means-based approximate spectral clustering (KASP) algorithm (Yan et al., 2009) which first applies the k-means algorithm to partition the given data into m small clusters and then performs spectral clustering to divide their centroids (which are the landmark points) into k groups. Next, they extend the clustering of the landmarks to the original data by performing 1 nearest neighbor (1NN) classification. This algorithm runs very fast, but is sensitive to the k-means clusters as it aggressively reduces the given data to a small set of centroids \n\nIn this work, we propose a novel landmark-based scalable spectral clustering approach by adapting the co-clustering framework by Dhillon (Dhillon, 2001) for landmark-based clustering and combining it with diffusion maps (Coifman and Lafon, 2006). Specifically, with the given data [MATH] and a selected landmark set [MATH], we first construct a bipartite graph G2 with X and Y being the two parts, and form edges between each xi and its s nearest neighbors yj in the landmark set with weights [MATH]. We then compute the transition probabilities for all the vertices of G2 and use them to define a random walk on the bipartite graph, which (when being iterated forward) further generates a diffusion process on G2. We expect the resulting diffusion coordinates to be able to capture the global geometry of the clusters at different scales and, as a result, the connectivity of each cluster will be significantly strengthened (see Fig. 2). We will show that the diffusion coordinates may be computed directly from the n \u00d7 m matrix A = (aij). Lastly, we propose three different ways to use the diffusion coordinates for clustering the data in X (depending on the length of the random walk). \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2, we review some necessary background. We then present our methodology in Section 3. Experiments are conducted in Section 4 to test our proposed algorithms.

This event was one that I shall never forget. I still wake up and wonder about our true purpose in life, and how we come into play when called upon. Things happen in our lives which we really do not understand. We certainly do not have full control over all aspects of our lives. The element of surprise is always a real variable for which can play upon our actions at any time, and any place. What took place recently for me was certainly an element of surprise for which I was called to action without warning, or preparation. What this event did prove to me was that our worth as human beings is gauged by what we know, proving once again that knowledge is a very powerful force which absolutely can save lives. One particular morning I decided to stop into a major store to check on something I was interested in purchasing. For no other reason would I have been there that day. The real reason perhaps may have been out of my control, as though I was guided there to be in place for my contribution to mankind. As I was strolling through the store looking for my item of interest, I could not help noticing that someone seemed a bit irritated and somewhat irrational in how they were communicating with another person. I didn't think much about it and continued about my business. Just moments later, it was obvious that this person was having some sort of medical problem due to their behavior and the apparent breathing problems that I had detected. I am CPR certified, and am trained on what to do in case of a medical emergency. Probably a good thing since there was not anyone else around the scene which I believe was in any position to help this person. I then took control and intervened immediately to check on the situation. As I had surmised, the person in trouble was an elderly man who had just collapsed, struggling to breath, and very incoherent to response. Immediately I commanded the closest person to call 911 and get help as fast as possible. I then evaluated the situation and began administering CPR until the medics could arrive. I noticed that the man had a medical bracelet  for which I instructed the caller to give that information to the 911 center to prepare the medics as they were en route to the scene. What seemed like an eternity to save this man's life while I was still in control, became like a major relief once the EMS team arrived, and took over. In short, The man lived without any severe consequences, and was doing great after a short stay in the hospital. This gave me a whole new perspective on life, and just how fragile we really are as we go about our lives. I still have to wonder what would have happened to that old man if I had not been called upon to be there in his time of need.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"CPR\", 1, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 6, 10, 13, 17], \"change\")", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

Enroll in computer programming, physics, and chemistry classes, and take as many math classes as possible.  This is an especially helpful first step if you are a high school (or younger) student interested in pursuing a career in computer security. You can even try to take Advanced Placement (AP) courses to help put you ahead when you reach the college level. Most high schools and junior highs have some kind of computer club that students can join and participate in. This is a great way to start developing your more advanced experience with computer technology, and it will also look good on your college application. You might even consider joining the robotics club at school for more experience with how technology and machinery can be integrated in the real world. Most computer security experts are now pursuing a bachelor's degree in a computer or IT-related major. Focus on choosing a high-quality program with the most up-to-date information on computer programming, networking, information systems, penetration testing, and systems analysis.  For some computer security positions, it\u2019s possible to get your foot in the door with an associate's degree accompanied by many years of experience as a substitute for a bachelor\u2019s degree. With an associate\u2019s degree, you\u2019ll spend less time and money on your education. However, you may have to start out at a lower entry-level position if you don\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Make sure you choose a program that values innovation and aims to teach student the most relevant and useful information. Talk to your high school teachers and guidance counselors for help on finding a college with programs that fit your interests. To get an idea about your prospective university\u2019s stance on these issues, consider reaching out to a current professor in a technology-related department to ask what they think about the value the university places on innovation. Consider getting a Master\u2019s degree in computer sciences, IT systems, or even engineering. This is especially helpful if you have an undergraduate degree in an unrelated field, but it will also set you apart from the rest of the job hunters who have only a bachelor\u2019s degree or lower. This will give you the conceptual and theoretical background necessary to qualify you to work as a computer security consultant. Microsoft (MCSE), Cisco (CCIE), and other companies provide training and certification programs. Any consultant should be able to show a high level of certified training, as it will improve your chances of getting contracts. You can get many of these certifications by taking online training modules with accompanying exams. There are also many testing centers (often operated by Google or Microsoft) that facilitate these types of certifications.  Some certifications are free, while others can cost anywhere from $200-2000 USD, depending on whether you just take the exam, or if you take the accompanying training course.  Training courses typically last between one day and several weeks, varying between each certification. Other useful certifications include: Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), ITIL, Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), SANS GIAC, Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Project Management Professional (PMP), Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP), Certified Protection Professional (CPP) and Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP). Local chapters of these kinds of professional organizations can help you join study groups, forums, and conferences. They can also help enhance your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and your expertise. Professional organizations are usually located in most larger cities, but function on a regional/national (or even international) level, which means that members can live anywhere and still participate.  To locate such organizations, try talking to other professionals in your field, reading respected journals in the field of computer technology, or searching around on the internet for groups to join. Two of the biggest organizations in the field are the Information Systems Security Association and the American Society for Industrial Security. Most organizations like this cost about $200 USD to join for an annual membership fee, though they often have discounts for students and retirees.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 10 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 10}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 4th, and 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [4, 19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_full_length": 0.28571428571428575, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 18], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 18], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3, 18], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([4, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

It can be used to process product or movie reviews in order to derive a general sentiment. Other applications include analysis of tweets to derive perception of a brand or thoughts of people on a speci\ufb01c topic. All of these applications can be boiled down to classi\ufb01cation or summarization tasks. The state of the art NLP techniques performs very well on these tasks for single language texts. However, they may not perform well on code-mixed text due to the unavailability of enough labeled data. The code-mixed text has become relevant these days because of di\ufb00erent social media platforms [4] [1]. Most of these platforms prefer             \f2 R. Joshi et al. English as the preferred medium of communication. In a multi-lingual country like India people tend to mix local language with English while using social media platforms. This is because people are more comfortable in local languages. It is natural to describe local terms or entities in local languages which result in code-mixing. Code-mixing essentially allows us to borrow terms from di\ufb00erent languages thus aiding ease of communication. A local touch can be given to the movie reviews, product reviews, and comments by adding some details in the local language. All of these factors have led to a rise in the popularity of codemixed text [6]. In order to understand such code-mixed text, it is important to identify the language used in di\ufb00erent parts of text followed by language-speci\ufb01c processing [3]. In this work, we present di\ufb00erent approaches for language identi\ufb01cation in code-mixed text. In the code-mixed text, languages can be interleaved in di\ufb00erent forms. One form of code-mixing is represented in this example, \u201dthis is not union budget, ye to aam admi ka budget hai\u201d with language tagged as \u201deng eng eng eng eng hin hin hin hin hin hin hin\u201d. Another form can be seen as \u201dmaine aaj WhatsApp and Facebook uninstall kiya h\u201d tagged as \u201dhin hin eng eng eng eng hin hin\u201d. It is challenging to determine the language of individual words as the same word can be used in both Hindi and Engish depending on the context. For example English words like \u201dare\u201d and \u201dmaze\u201d can also be used in Hindi as \u201dare mai ghar jaa raha hu\u201d, and \u201dappke to maze hai\u201d. To make it more challenging the social media text is normally noisy where words are written in di\ufb00erent ways just to emphasize them. For example the in word \u201dgood\u201d the letter \u2019o\u2019 can be repeated multiple times to get di\ufb00erent variations like \u201dthe movie was gooood\u201d. This makes it important to consider di\ufb00erent input representations. The sentence can be processed word by word or character by character. The more recent form of representation is sub-word where a word is split into logical sub-word units [8]. The character and sub-word based representations are more agnostic to noisy text variations as compared to word representation which will treat each variation as a separate word. The focus of our work is to evaluate the performance of these input representations. This is the \ufb01rst work to explore sub-word based representations for Hi-En language identi\ufb01cation. The task is to determine the language of each word in the sentence. The task is formulated as a token classi\ufb01cation task. The deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short term memory (LSTM) networks are the most popular techniques used for token classi\ufb01cation. We use these simple models in combination with di\ufb00erent input representations to evaluate their e\ufb00ectiveness. These models are often used with a conditional random \ufb01eld (CRF) to improve the performance. However, the work is restricted to simple architectures with a focus on input representation. We show that sub-word based representation coupled with these simple models perform better than other complex architectures reported in the literature. Simple architectures are also favorable as it reduces runtime speed and complexity. The language identi\ufb01cation module should be fast and e\ufb03cient as it will often be followed by other NLP modules. With this perspective, we experiment with single-layer CNN and LSTM models. The ex\fLanguage Identi\ufb01cation in Hindi-English Code Mixed Text periments show that these architectures are su\ufb03cient to reach desired accuracy levels. The main contributions of this work are: \u2013 The e\ufb00ectiveness of character, sub-word, and word-based representations are evaluated for the task of Hindi-English language identi\ufb01cation. \u2013 The combinations of popular model architectures and input representations are also compared.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 42 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 42}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 29 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_full_length": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["word_count_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"]}}}

The more valuable the land, the higher the property taxes. Because the value of land can change over time, so can your property tax liability, even if your local government does not specifically change the tax rate. To start finding your property tax liability, you need to know how much the land you own is worth.  Property values are usually determined by a local or county assessor \u2014 someone whose job is specifically to do this. To find the value of your residence, you can contact your local assessor's office or else your local tax authority. Note that many assessors have tools online that will allow you to look up your property's value based on your address. The assessor's office for Santa Clara Country in California has a great example of this sort of tool.  You can also sometimes get home value estimates from financial institutions. For example, Chase Bank offers a free online home value tool here. The value of a piece of land is usually determined by two things: the value of the land itself and the value of whatever is built on the land (i.e., its improvements.) To find the total value of your property, you'll need to add these two values together. Usually, the local assessor can provide both pieces of information. For example purposes, let's find the property taxes for a house in ABC County, USA. The county assessor values the land at $357,000, mainly due to its close proximity to a vibrant, bustling downtown area and the convenience of two nearby freeways. The assessor values the house itself at $307,000. Adding these two values, the total value of our property is 357,000 + 307,000 = $664,000. In the next few steps, we'll use this value to find our property taxes. Property tax is generally assessed as some percentage of the property's current value. This tax rate can (and does) vary over time depending on the needs of the taxing agency \u2014 for instance, if your county has a budget shortfall, it may raise the tax rate to make ends meet. Thus, up-to-date information is crucial.  Like your assessed property value, you can usually get this information from your local tax authority. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, tax rate summaries are available online for free.  Many municipalities apply the tax rate \"per mill\", or per $1,000 in assessed value. Don't let this confuse you \u2014 one mill is just 1/10 of one cent. For practical purposes, we can say that 10 mill of something is the same as 1%. E.g., a 20 mill levy on $100,000 would equal 2% of $100,000, or $2,000. For the purposes of our example, let's say that ABC County has a 10 mill levy on our property. This amounts to 1% of our property's total value. The local government isn't the only organization that relies on property tax revenues. Other organizations that serve the local community often require their own share of property taxes. Notably, most public school districts get the majority of their revenue from local property taxes \u2014 about 77% in 2007, the most recent year that data is available. Cities, towns, and other local entities may also require property taxes. In our example, let's say that the city of Appleton, where we live in ABC County, has its own 20 mill (2%) property tax and that the Appleton Unified School District levies its own property tax at a 30 mill rate (3%). When you know all of the different property taxes that you will have to pay, finding your total liability is fairly easy. Start by adding up the different tax rates to get one total property tax rate that you'll need to pay. In our example, since we owe a 1% property tax to the county, 2% to the city, and 3% to the school district, we owe, in total, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6% Take your total property tax rate and multiply it by the value of the property you are dealing with. The answer you get is the amount of money you owe in property tax.  Don't forget that, to multiply a percentage, you must either first change the percentage back to its decimal form or else divide your answer by 100. In our example, our total property tax rate is 6% and our property is worth $664,000. To find the amount we owe in taxes, we multiply 0.06 \u00d7 $664,000 = $39,840.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less

Once you know which progressions are most common in the music you listen to, you\u2019ll have a much easier time identifying them in songs you want to learn.  Diatonic chords are numbered with Roman numerals according to the position of the root note on the scale. For example, the I chord on the C major scale is the C tonic chord (C-E-G), consisting of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the C major scale. Minor chords are written with lower case Roman numerals (e.g., i, ii, iv, etc.). One of the most common chord progressions in Western popular music is I-IV-V-I. Try playing common chords and really paying attention to what they sound like. Don\u2019t just stick to root positions (where the notes played are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes, or scale degrees, of the key)\u2014practice listening to inversions, too (such as 3rd, 5th, 8th). Listen to 7th, diminished, and augmented chords as well as basic major and minor triads. The more you listen to the chords, the more familiar they will become.  For example, in C Major, the root notes are C, E, and G, while E, G, and C, are the 3rd, 5th, and 8th scale degrees, respectively, of the first inversion of C. Try quizzing yourself with a chord identification tool like this one: https://tonedear.com/ear-training/chord-identification Songs written in major keys tend to sound bright, upbeat, happy, or hopeful, while minor keys lend a gloomy, sad, or scary sound. The easiest way to determine whether a song is major or minor is simply to listen to the overall \u201cmood\u201d of the piece. While the chords in a minor key song will primarily be minor chords, there will likely be some major chords mixed in. The reverse is also true of major key songs. Once you\u2019ve figured out the tonic chord, you will have a good foundation for figuring out the rest of the song. Most songs end on the tonic (I) chord, and many also begin there. The tonic chord should be the predominant chord throughout the song, and hearing it will give you a sense of completion or satisfaction. For example, \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star,\u201d when played in the key of C major, begins and ends on a C major tonic chord. In most songs, the bass line is the harmonic accompaniment to the melody. The bass line tends to be built on the root notes of each chord in the song. This means that if you can figure out the notes of the bass \u201cmelody,\u201d you can pinpoint the root of each chord and build from there.  For example, if you are listening to \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d in C major, you may identify the notes C, F, C, F, C, G, C in the bass line of the first 4 measures. These are the root notes of the chords for those measures. Once you\u2019ve figured out the root notes, ask yourself about the quality of each chord. Does it sound major or minor? Do you hear tones other than the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the chord (e.g., the 7th)? After you\u2019ve figured out the chords, play them in order, following the rhythm of the piece. You may find it helpful to play along with a recording of the song to make sure that you have the timing right. Depending on the type of instrument you\u2019re playing, this could mean playing the different parts together or playing the chords as accompaniment to a voice or a second instrument. Run through the song several times to make sure that your chord changes are timed correctly with the melody. For example, if you are playing the piano, you will probably play the chords primarily with your left hand while your right hand carries the melody.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.125, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "score = text_eval()", "for sentence in range(len(text.split('.'))):", "word_count = len(text.split('.')[sentence].split())", "label = sentence_length_check(word_count, \"more than\")", "if label == 0:", "print(f\"Sentence: {text.split('.')[sentence]}; Improvement Plan: Increase the number of words in this sentence.\")", "else:", "print(f\"Sentence: {text.split('.')[sentence]}; Improvement Plan: Add more words to this sentence to meet the condition.\")", "sentence_count = len(text.split('.'))", "label = sentence_count_check(sentence_count, \"more than\")", "if label == 0:", "print(\"Improvement Plan: Ensure the output includes more than 28 sentences.\")", "else:", "print(\"Improvement Plan: Add more sentences to the output to meet the condition.\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"]}}}

Perhaps you just want to feel more comfortable around them yourself. Before starting a conversation, make sure you know what your goals are in bringing up your concerns.  It\u2019s possible that your goals can\u2019t be achieved. For example, you might wish that a much older relative would stop using a word you find offensive. However, they may be so stuck in their ways that having a conversation isn\u2019t going to yield your desired result. If your goal isn\u2019t achievable, choose one that is. You might not be able to stop your relative from using that word, but you can at least let them know how you feel about it. Choose a time and place when you can both feel comfortable. You should be able to have privacy and not feel rushed. You may want to let them choose the time and place.  Let them know why you\u2019d like to talk to them. You can say, \u201cYou said something the other day that I\u2019d like to talk to you about. Are you up for that?\u201d Let them know that you are assuming the best about them. You can say, \u201cYou said something earlier that I admit I found offensive. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t intend that, but I\u2019d like to talk about it.\u201d If the person is someone you know well and trust, keep that in mind. They  may feel awful knowing that they offended you. If they\u2019re someone whom you don\u2019t know well or don\u2019t trust, keep that in mind, too.  Consider whether the person has any motivation to change their behavior. For example, if their job is at stake, they will likely take this conversation seriously. If they\u2019re unlikely to ever see you again, they may simply brush off your concern. You can use your relationship to the person to help influence them. For example, you could say to a service provider, \u201cI\u2019d like to continue hiring you, but I feel really uncomfortable when I hear that kind of language.\u201d Or to a relative, such as your child, you could say, \u201cI don't feel comfortable being around others when you speak that way.\u201d If the remark was particularly hurtful, tell the person that if it happens again, you will take action. This is generally appropriate when hateful words or slurs are used knowingly.  In a work environment, you can say, \u201cIf I hear that word again, I\u2019m going to have to speak to our supervisor.\u201d In a family context, you can say, \u201cI think I will have to go home if you continue speaking like that.\u201d Just tell them straight forward. We usually overthink things and make the worst of it. Being straight forward does not mean that you should rub it in their face. You just have to say how you feel without gracing your self ego as well as theirs. People always try to tell some indirect stories and it ends up vindicating the other person. Knowing how you feel may help the person understand. They might not understand why what they said is offensive, but knowing that you feel hurt could be enough to help them change their behavior.  Use \u201cI\u201d statements. This means saying, \u201cI felt angry when you used that word to describe our coworker\u201d instead of, \u201cIt was wrong of you to use that word to describe our coworker.\u201d Another example is saying, \u201cI felt embarrassed when you told that joke\u201d instead of, \u201cThat joke wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d Try to express your feelings without getting visibly upset. If the remark was extremely offensive, you may feel panicked or even start to cry. If this happens, that\u2019s okay. You may simply need to take some time and space before you can have a calm conversation. If you find yourself becoming upset during the conversation, excuse yourself.  Say something along the lines of, \"Please give me a minute, I'd like to discuss this with a level head.\"\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 15]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 3 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 3}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.8571428571428571, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.8571428571428571, "simpo_full_length": 0.2, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "word_count_check(3, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(3, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(3, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"you\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"to\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"a\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"an\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"is\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"in\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"on\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"at\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"and\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"of\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"if\", \"remove\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(3, \"more than\")"]}}}
