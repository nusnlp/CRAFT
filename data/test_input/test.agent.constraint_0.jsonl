Instead, you should approach the situation as honestly as you can, and make sure that the communication goes as smoothly as possible.  Practice maintaining a steady and even tone when you deliver the news. Make eye contact and hold his hand when you tell him. Plan on telling him your feelings. You may have mixed feelings about the pregnancy too. Whatever you feel, this is something you will be able to work out together. You should know your own husband well enough to anticipate how he would react to the news of your pregnancy. If you're married, you must have talked about having children at some point, so you should remember anything he has said about the topic to gauge his reaction. Has he said that he'd love to have kids one day, or has he made it clear that he has no interest in having children? Knowing his perspective on children will help you see how he'll react.  Think of other times when you've told him unexpected or overwhelming news. Though it's unlikely that you ever told him anything as important as the fact that you're pregnant, remembering his reaction can give you some insight. Did he take the news calmly, was he emotional, or was he very upset? If he has a history of violent behavior and you think the news may make him react violently, then don't tell him alone. Make sure you're with a friend or family member when you give him the news. Though you should have the conversation as soon as possible, picking an ideal date and time to have the talk can help the conversation go more smoothly. Pick a time that works well for both of you, and when you know he won't have anything stressful to do afterwards so he can let the news sink in. Here are some good ways to pick the time to have the talk:  Find a time that is relatively stress-free for both of you, when you can give each other your undivided attention. Don't be too dramatic when you ask him about a good time to have the talk. Just say there's something you've wanted to talk to him about. If you're too dramatic, he may want to have the talk right then and there and you may not be prepared for it. Don't tell him right after he gets home from work. Wait until he has some time to relax after dinner. Once you have your husband's undivided attention, there is no use delaying it. You have to open up. You can make him feel more comfortable with a reassuring pat or by holding his hand, but don't take too long to cut to the chase.  Say, \"I just found out some big news. I'm pregnant.\" Wait for the news to sink in. If he's emotional and leans toward you, give him a hug. If he's sitting in stony silence, be patient and don't overwhelm him. If he wants to communicate but he's at a loss for words, tell him more about your feelings toward the pregnancy. If he's receptive, ask him to share his feelings. Once he gets his bearings, he will have a lot to say. You have said your part and now it's time for you to listen. Don't interrupt him or get angry with him. After all, he has just received some life-changing news. Try to remain calm even if he is heated or emotional. Remember that you have had more time to digest the news than he did. Once you've both shared your feelings, you should talk about what you will do about your pregnancy. You might need a breather before you jump right into a heated discussion about what to do with the baby, but don't delay the conversation for too long.  Before you make a decision, make sure that you are both completely sure.

ChatGPT is one key example of how AI technology is becoming increasingly important in generating more and more precise human-like responses to a wide variety of problems, including business ones. These advancements have significant implications for the financial industry, where vast amounts of regulatory data and policies must be analysed and understood in order to comply with laws and regulations. 22 v o N1 ] L C . s c [ v38.12 : v i X r a             \fIndeed, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained traction in financial regulation as a solution for managing and interpreting complex regulatory information. The ability to effectively process and analyse large amounts of regulatory text is crucial for compliance officers, risk managers, and other financial professionals. However, traditional methods of automatic text processing including keyword searches and dictionaries are both inefficient to run at the scale required by the amount of files to treat, and costly to set up since they require system experts to design dictionaries on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, they are also prone to errors due to lack of coverage which can expose the user to costly regulatory violations. Modern NLP techniques have emerged in recent years, mostly based on deep neural networks and after the seminal breakthrough [1] by Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser and Polosukhin, who incorporated the attention mechanism to learn latent semantic links between words in a sentence more accurately. These improvements, along with orders of magnitude increases in the availability of datasets and computational power have led to large language model (LLM), a type of model known for its ability to achieve general-purpose language understanding and generation such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT (used in ChatGPT), Meta\u2019s LLaMa or Google\u2019s PaLM. One may however wonder whether LLMs are actually required for simple NLP tasks such as semantic search, especially due to their costs, instead of free open resources. In the present work, we perform a semantic search applied to laws and regulation using a so called domain adaptation technique with limited amount of data, bearing in mind limited available resources from small and medium enterprises. We also recall the historical NLP approaches and explain the leading concepts in this field. In particular, we focus on semantic search, which naturally leads to the encoding concepts of a sentence. We thus aim to fill the gap between well-known NLP concepts and the mathematical frameworks behind. This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 is a short historical review on encoding methods of a sentence into a mathematical object as well as key machine learning advances.

The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road.

Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it.

Decide what time works best for you. Some people find it helpful to swim before work, while others benefit more from swimming after work. It just depends on what your schedule is. It will take your body some time to form the rhythms between your stroke and breathe. While you are first starting, commit yourself to swim at least 10 minutes three to five times a week. Then slowly push on to thirty minutes or more. A 2-hour swim session might look like this:  Warmup - 15 mins, typically 200m freestyle then more easy swims, done at strength pace (focusing on applying constant strong pressure on each movement). Kick or Pull - 15 mins. It's a great way to loosen up muscles and to start to warm up the legs or warm and get into a rhythm. Hypoxic - 5 mins, usually done before or after the main set, hypoxic describes the holding of breath under duress or exercise. Do sprints while only taking 1 or 2 breaths per length, or butterfly kick underwater to halfway and then butterfly (breathing every 3 strokes) for the rest of the length. Don't do hypoxic training for very long if you expect to be doing a main set afterwards. Main Set - 35 mins A short amount of lengths done at high intensity on fast times or lower intensity but lots of laps without rest. A good example is 5 x 50m freestyle on 40 seconds with a target of 30. Warmdown - Very important, warmdown gives swimmers a chance to recover and stretch out their muscles. You should be aiming to have a good DPS (distance per stroke; doing as little strokes per lap, should be doing 12-16 in a 25m pool). Focus on both your inhales and your exhales. When you're not breathing, don't move your head. Keeping your head in a fixed position is more efficient. Only tilt your head to breathe.  A lot of swimmers have this problem of not exhaling underwater. Make sure you exhale a bit when submerging back underwater to maintain breathing and prevent your nose from filling up with water. Never tilt your head upwards when you need to take a breath. Always tilt your head to the side. In Freestyle, keep one goggle in the water and one goggle out. This helps to make sure that you don't over-turn your head. Try to breath every three or five strokes, to make sure you breath on both sides of your body. Don't hold your breath. The backstroke can be one the most challenging strokes to accomplish. It requires strong back and shoulder muscles. The key to perform a fluid backstroke lies in your hips. Practice a simple drill of flutter kicks on your back while one arm is raised. Switch arms after a lap and then finish with a lap of normal backstroke. The breast stroke relies on the synchronization of your glide and stroke. This fluidity does not happen overnight. Pulling harder or trying to pull more water back can actually be counterproductive.  Make sure to always do a pullout. Pullouts give you a headstart and and are very important for your breaststroke being strong and fast. Your arms shouldn't actually push water behind you, but instead you should focus on shaping an upside-down-heart with your hands. Bring your hands together as you extend them forward. Use your elbows, not your arms, to push your hands forward. If you commit a full day to just one type of stroke, you'll sync into the rhythm of that stroke faster. You could even isolate one stroke for an entire week, then switch strokes the following week. This is a tricky maneuver that will increase your speed doing laps. Look for the \"big T.\" The \"big T\" is the perpendicular line at the end of the lane in a lap pool. As your head crosses the T, tuck your chin into your chest while you are following through with a stroke. Then dolphin kick your legs for a final push.   Don't look up before doing the flip. The wall will always be there as long as you look for the \"big T\" at the bottom of the pool.   This maneuver can be a challenge and it is recommend to have someone to show you first-hand how to do this. To go faster, do a couple of dolphin kicks underwater in streamline position.

Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements:  Self-kindness. We\u2019re sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others. Common humanity. It can be easy to believe you\u2019re the only one capable of imperfections and guilt, but making errors and experiencing pain are part of what makes us human. Understanding that you\u2019re not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you. Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: it\u2019s the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, \u201cI\u2019m so unattractive, nobody will love me,\u201d a mindfulness approach might be something like, \u201cI\u2019m experiencing the feeling that I\u2019m unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today.\u201d Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere. We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, they\u2019re not; they are usually based in fear.  Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of \u201cpoor me\u201d that you may experience when things don\u2019t go your way; for example, \u201cMy colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me.\u201d Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, \u201cMy colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can\u2019t control how others respond to our work.\u201d Self-compassion isn\u2019t laziness. Accepting yourself doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t want to improve yourself. It just means that you won\u2019t be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others. Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement. While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and it\u2019s important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, it\u2019s the most confident people who know the least about a situation. Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and we\u2019re very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we aren\u2019t worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it\u2019s an internal judgment.  Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you don\u2019t deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love. This doesn\u2019t come naturally to most people, because we\u2019re often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself.  Point out your strengths to yourself. We\u2019re used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones. Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you\u2019ll probably become less resistant to believing them. Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think \u201cI\u2019m a failure\u201d if you haven\u2019t succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.\u201d Remind yourself that you\u2019re human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: \u201cI am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.\u201d Sometimes, you will do something that you didn\u2019t want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friend\u2019s feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences.  Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future. Accepting your mistakes doesn\u2019t mean pretending they didn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.25, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"self-compassion\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"accept\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 10, 14, 19], \"change\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"self-compassion\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"self\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 5, 8], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"self-esteem\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1205, "ori_file_path": 1205, "source": "wle_627"}, "input_content": "Self-compassion is the extension of acceptance and empathy to yourself.

Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you\u2019ll probably become less resistant to believing them. Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think \u201cI\u2019m a failure\u201d if you haven\u2019t succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.\u201d Remind yourself that you\u2019re human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: \u201cI am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.\u201d Sometimes, you will do something that you didn\u2019t want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friend\u2019s feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences.  Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future. Accepting your mistakes doesn\u2019t mean pretending they didn\u2019t happen. It doesn\u2019t even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth.\n", "final_instruction": "Improve the following text:\n\n", "content": "Self-compassion is the extension of acceptance and empathy to yourself. Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements:  Self-kindness. We\u2019re sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others. Common humanity. It can be easy to believe you\u2019re the only one capable of imperfections and guilt, but making errors and experiencing pain are part of what makes us human. Understanding that you\u2019re not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you. Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: it\u2019s the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, \u201cI\u2019m so unattractive, nobody will love me,\u201d a mindfulness approach might be something like, \u201cI\u2019m experiencing the feeling that I\u2019m unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today.\u201d Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere. We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, they\u2019re not; they are usually based in fear.  Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of \u201cpoor me\u201d that you may experience when things don\u2019t go your way; for example, \u201cMy colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me.\u201d Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, \u201cMy colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can\u2019t control how others respond to our work.\u201d Self-compassion isn\u2019t laziness. Accepting yourself doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t want to improve yourself. It just means that you won\u2019t be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others. Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement. While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and it\u2019s important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, it\u2019s the most confident people who know the least about a situation. Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and we\u2019re very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we aren\u2019t worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it\u2019s an internal judgment.  Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you don\u2019t deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love. This doesn\u2019t come naturally to most people, because we\u2019re often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself.  Point out your strengths to yourself. We\u2019re used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones. Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you\u2019ll probably become less resistant to believing them. Depersonalize your failures.

INTRODUCTION The landscape of robotics is continually evolving, ushering in an era of advanced robots capable of performing tasks in complex and dynamic settings[1]. One of the paramount challenges in this field is the efficient and effective path planning for robots, necessitating a synergy between motion planning and perception algorithms to devise safe and optimal motion strategies. The literature has seen the emergence of potent methodologies in the realm of path planning, including graph optimization path planning [2], [3], [4], heuristic-based strategies [5], and the exploration of rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) [6], [7], [8]. Despite these advances, conventional path-planning frameworks often falter in navigating complex environments and in formulating dependable strategies amidst fluctuating environmental conditions [9], [10], [11].

Look for what may be causing the barking behavior when it happens. The following are some common reasons for dogs to bark:   Fear/Alarm. When dogs are startled or afraid, they may bark. Nervous dogs tend to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound, regardless of where they are.  Territorial protection. Dogs protect what they perceive as \u201ctheir\u201d territory. Practically speaking, this could be anywhere that your dog associates with you: your house or yard, the car, or even your \u201cpersonal space\u201d around your body. Dogs also consider places or routes they travel frequently as their territory, so if you take your dog on the same walk every day, he's likely to consider everything along that route \u201chis.\u201d  Attention. Many dogs will bark when they want attention. These barks may be very short and focused. This is especially common if you reward the behavior by responding to the barking.  Greeting. Dogs bark to say hello. They may bark at other people or other animals. They also may bark to invite some playtime.  Anxiety. Dogs may bark due to separation anxiety. These dogs can't stand being alone and will bark compulsively when they are left on their own.  Frustration. Dogs may bark when they're frustrated. If your dog is tied up, can't get at his favorite toy, or wants to go and play with the dog next door, he may bark to signal that he's frustrated with the situation. A dog may also bark if he's bored. Barking communicates your dog's emotional state. Reading your dog's body language can provide clues as to how your dog feels. For example, if your dog is afraid, she may bark while hunched down. Once you know what's behind the barking, you can help quiet your dog. Here are some signs of your dog's various moods:   Afraid. When dogs are afraid, they make themselves smaller to appear as less of a threat. They hunch over, tuck their tails, and flatten their ears to their heads. They may yawn or lick their lips as a way of comforting themselves.  Happy. When dogs are happy, their muscles are relaxed. Their mouths are loose and may look like they're smiling. They may pant. Their ears and tail are in the natural positions, and the tail may wag from side to side or in a circular movement.  Alert. Dogs go on the alert if they perceive something could be a threat. Their ears are perked up and their gaze will focus on whatever they're looking at. Their tails may be upright or over the back, but they are usually still. The hackles (the fur on the shoulders and upper back) may be raised.  Playful. Dogs who are feeling playful are all over the place. They're very energetic, with bouncy movements. They may jump, run in circles, or bow to invite you to play. Playful dogs may look like they're smiling.  Dominant. Dogs who feel confident about the interaction display assertive body language. They stand very tall, arch their necks, and appear slightly tense. Their tails are usually upright and still. They may make eye contact.  Aggressive. Dogs who feel confident and aggressive about the situation make themselves look bigger by raising their tails, pricking up their ears, and holding their heads high. They may lunge or look ready to pounce. Their lips are often retracted to show the teeth, although sometimes they may pucker their lips forward. Aggressive dogs who are feeling defensive combine fearful and confident body language. You can tell a lot about a bark by how it sounds. Studies have shown that humans are fairly good at deciphering the overall emotion behind the tone of dog barks.  Happy barks are usually high-pitched. Barking as a greeting may also include other noises, such as whines and growls. Barks demanding attention are often short, focused barks. Lower-pitched or harsh-sounding barks usually indicate a disturbance of some kind, like fear or alarm. Separation anxiety barking sounds are often shrill. They sound despairing and miserable. Compulsive barking is often a monotone barking. It sounds repetitive and is often accompanied by movement that seems compulsive.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1128, "ori_file_path": 1128, "source": "wle_550"}, "input_content": "Dogs have a wide variety of barks, and they're usually triggered by specific situations.

This will help you predict any hiccups you might experience in starting your business, such as figuring out how to secure funding or what area of town is the best location for your business.  Traditionally, business plans are broken down into some combination of these 9 nine sections: executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management, service or product line, marketing, funding, financial projections, and appendix. Be as detailed in your plan as possible. Make a list of the smaller details about your business, such as owner\u2019s and employees\u2019 responsibilities, the types of services you\u2019ll provide, and what prices you intend to offer your products at. To maximize your chances of success, you\u2019ll need to determine what you can offer in your aquarium shop that customers in your area can\u2019t get from your competitors. Visit other aquarium shops to see what products and services they sell, what prices they offer, and other relevant aspects of their businesses. Another good way to do this type of research is to learn what leading aquarium shops are doing, then figure out how you could do it better. For example, if a major aquarium shop offers free next-day installation, see if your store can offer free same-day installation. Check with your state and local governments to learn what types of licenses and certificates your business will be required to have. Because you\u2019ll be working with animals, your shop will also be subject to any animal welfare laws that exist where you\u2019re located.  For example, if your aquarium shop is located in the United States, it is required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act. If you\u2019re unsure what licenses, certificates, or insurance you\u2019ll need, you may want to hire a business attorney who can help guide you through these legal questions. Ideally, try to hire one with experience working with pet stores. It may seem counterintuitive, but you\u2019ll want to look for an available storefront as close to your biggest competitor as possible, in order to take advantage of the foot traffic that their store generates. Plus, if they\u2019re successful, it\u2019s probably due in part to their location, which means placing your store in the same location should also help your shop.  You may not want to be directly next to your competitor, since customers may consistently choose your competitor\u2019s store over yours. However, you should aim to be in the same shopping center or area of town, if you can. If you\u2019re planning to only sell materials online, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about where your store or warehouse is located. This may include cash registers, store cleaning supplies, or even light bulbs. You can acquire most of these items from a small business wholesaler in your area. You might also be able to buy some of these items, such as cleaning supplies, online or from a mass retailer. Unless you plan to do all the work running the store by yourself or within your family, you\u2019ll probably need to bring on some extra staff. Hire these workers before you actually open your store for business, so you can hit the ground running. For best results, try to hire workers who have previous experience working in aquarium shops.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1285, "ori_file_path": 1285, "source": "wle_707"}, "input_content": "Write out what the short- and long-term plans for your company are in terms of appealing to customers, turning a profit, and expanding, if applicable.

Unless you plan to do all the work running the store by yourself or within your family, you\u2019ll probably need to bring on some extra staff.

This will help you predict any hiccups you might experience in starting your business, such as figuring out how to secure funding or what area of town is the best location for your business.  Traditionally, business plans are broken down into some combination of these 9 nine sections: executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management, service or product line, marketing, funding, financial projections, and appendix. Be as detailed in your plan as possible. Make a list of the smaller details about your business, such as owner\u2019s and employees\u2019 responsibilities, the types of services you\u2019ll provide, and what prices you intend to offer your products at. To maximize your chances of success, you\u2019ll need to determine what you can offer in your aquarium shop that customers in your area can\u2019t get from your competitors. Visit other aquarium shops to see what products and services they sell, what prices they offer, and other relevant aspects of their businesses. Another good way to do this type of research is to learn what leading aquarium shops are doing, then figure out how you could do it better. For example, if a major aquarium shop offers free next-day installation, see if your store can offer free same-day installation. Check with your state and local governments to learn what types of licenses and certificates your business will be required to have. Because you\u2019ll be working with animals, your shop will also be subject to any animal welfare laws that exist where you\u2019re located.  For example, if your aquarium shop is located in the United States, it is required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act. If you\u2019re unsure what licenses, certificates, or insurance you\u2019ll need, you may want to hire a business attorney who can help guide you through these legal questions. Ideally, try to hire one with experience working with pet stores. It may seem counterintuitive, but you\u2019ll want to look for an available storefront as close to your biggest competitor as possible, in order to take advantage of the foot traffic that their store generates. Plus, if they\u2019re successful, it\u2019s probably due in part to their location, which means placing your store in the same location should also help your shop.  You may not want to be directly next to your competitor, since customers may consistently choose your competitor\u2019s store over yours. However, you should aim to be in the same shopping center or area of town, if you can. If you\u2019re planning to only sell materials online, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about where your store or warehouse is located. This may include cash registers, store cleaning supplies, or even light bulbs. You can acquire most of these items from a small business wholesaler in your area. You might also be able to buy some of these items, such as cleaning supplies, online or from a mass retailer. Unless you plan to do all the work running the store by yourself or within your family, you\u2019ll probably need to bring on some extra staff.

In all cases, a language model is used in combination with other information sources to rank alternative hypotheses by assigning them some probabilities. There are classical techniques for constructing language models such as n-gram models with various smoothing techniques (see Chen and Goodman (1998) and the references therein for a survey and comparison of these techniques). \n\nIn some recent text and speech processing applications, several new and more general problems arise that are related to the construction of language models. We present new and efficient algorithms to address these more general problems. \n\nCounting. Classical language models are constructed by deriving statistics from large input texts. In speech mining applications or for adaptation purposes, one often needs to construct a language model based on the output of a speech recognition system. But, the output of a recognition system is not just text. Indeed, the word error rate of conversational speech recognition systems is still too high in many tasks to rely only on the one-best output of the recognizer. Thus, the word lattice output by speech recognition systems is used instead because it contains the correct transcription in most cases. \n\nA word lattice is a weighted finite automaton (WFA) output by the recognizer for a particular utterance. It contains typically a very large set of alternative transcription sentences for that utterance with the corresponding weights or probabilities. A necessary step for constructing a language model based on a word lattice is to derive the statistics for any given sequence from the lattices, or WFAs, output by the recognizer. This cannot be done by simply enumerating each path of the lattice and counting the number of occurrences of the sequence considered in each path since the number of paths of even a small automaton may be more than four billion. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the expected count of any given sequence in a WFA and report experimental results demonstrating its efficiency. \n\nRepresentation of language models by WFAs. Classical n-gram language models admit a natural representation by WFAs in which each state encodes a left context of width less than n. However, the size of that representation makes it impractical for offline optimizations such as those used in large-vocabulary speech recognition or general information extraction systems. Most offline representations of these models are based instead on an approximation to limit their size. We describe a new technique for creating an exact representation of n-gram language models by WFAs whose size is practical for offline use even in tasks with a vocabulary size of about 500,000 words and for n = 6. \n\nClass-based models. In many applications, it is natural and convenient to construct class-based language models, that is, models based on classes of words (Brown et al., 1992). Such models are also often more robust since they may include words that belong to a class but that were not found in the corpus. Classical class-based models are based on simple classes such as a list of words. But new clustering algorithms allow one to create more general and more complex classes that may be regular languages. Very large and complex classes can also be defined using regular expressions. We present a simple and more general approach to class-based language models based on general weighted context-dependent rules (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Mohri and Sproat, 1996). Our approach allows us to deal efficiently with more complex classes such as weighted regular languages. \n\nWe have fully implemented the algorithms just mentioned and incorporated them in a general software library for language modeling, the GRM Library, that includes many other text and grammar processing functionalities (Allauzen et al., 2003).

Compared to virtual agents, embodied ones utilize commonsense knowledge for high-level task planning together with low-level manipulation planning. In this context LLMs have already shown to be effective in translating natural language users\u2019 requests into tasks for executions on a robot [3\u20136]. The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) [7] is a well-known description formalism for modelling actions as well as their preconditions and effects. Representing actions in PDDL and running a domain independent PDDL-planner allows to generate executable plans, which potentially get converted to executable instructions, or serve as a prediction model about the future development of the situation. PDDL can play a role as a bridge between LLM output and execution systems which opens interesting prospectives for goal reasoning [8] and probabilistic thought modelling [9]. In this paper we focus on utilizing LLMs for the automated generation of PDDL-domains out of users\u2019 requests expressed in natural language. Although the idea of extracting PDDL-domains with LLMs is not novel [10], achieving consistency in extracted domains, so that they can be directly used for planning, still remains a challenge [11]. Another challenge is to detect and explain inconsistencies of failing PDDL domains, so that that they can be repaired based on a plan which is considered to be valid [12\u201314]. The contribution of our paper bridges the gap between these two challenges, with the target to solve the problem of generating runnable PDDL domains and problems. The analysis of semantic correctness as well as quality of textual descriptions is out of scope of this paper. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a generation strategy for avoiding syntax errors in a generated markup; 1Honda Research Institute Europe, Offenbach, Germany 2) a combination of consistency checks and reachability analysis techniques over LLM-generated domains and problems. In particular, we integrate several mechanisms into a LLM-based generation loop. Misused predicates and types of parameters are getting filtered out before the planning, and missing, contradicting or never reached predicates are getting detected and forwarded back to LLM to correct mistakes. As a result, the amount of errors in the generated domains is reduced, leading to significantly improved domain descriptions for the last stage human checks.

About 3% of the hair shaft is made up of omega-3 fatty acids, which are also found in cell membranes in the skin of the scalp, and in the natural oils that keep the scalp and hair hydrated. If salmon doesn't thrill you, you can also get essential fatty acids from fish like herring, sardines, trout, and mackerel, as well as avocado and pumpkin seeds. Walnuts are the only type of nut that have a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids. They're also rich in biotin and vitamin E, which helps protect cells from DNA damage. Walnuts also have copper, a mineral that helps keep your natural hair color rich and lustrous. Try using walnut oil in your salad dressing or stir-fry instead of canola or safflower oil. Oysters are rich in zinc, a lack of which can lead to hair loss (even eyelashes), as well as a dry, flaky scalp. Just three ounces of oysters contain almost five times your daily zinc requirement. They also boast a high level of protein. Zinc can also be found in  nuts, beef, eggs and fortified cereals and whole grain breads. Sweet potatoes are a great source of the antioxidant beta carotene, which your body turns into vitamin A. Vitamin A helps produce and protect the oils that nourish the scalp. A lack of vitamin A can lead to a dry, itchy scalp and problems with dandruff. Carrots, cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and apricots are all good sources of beta carotene. A great source of protein, eggs are loaded with four key minerals: zinc, selenium, sulfur, and iron. Iron is especially important, because it helps cells carry oxygen to the hair follicles, and too little iron can lead to anemia, which is a major cause of hair loss, particularly in women.  In addition to other nutrients, eggs are a natural source of the b-vitamin biotin, which supports healthy hair.  You can also boost your iron stores by eating animal products, including chicken, fish, pork, and beef. Spinach is a super-food containing iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C which combine to help keep hair follicles healthy and scalp oils circulating. If you're not a spinach fan, try eating similarly nutrient-rich dark, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, kale, and Swiss chard. Tiny but mighty, these legumes are teeming with protein, iron, zinc, and biotin, making them a great staple for vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters alike. Greek yogurt is high in hair-friendly protein, vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid -- an ingredient you'll often see on hair care product labels), and vitamin D, which emerging research links with hair follicle health. Other similarly beneficial dairy products include cottage cheese, low-fat cheese, and skim milk. Blueberries are a super fruit with numerous health benefits, but it's their high vitamin C content which really helps keep hair in top shape. Vitamin C is critical for boosting circulation to the scalp, supporting the tiny blood vessels that feed the hair follicles. Too little vitamin C in your diet can lead to hair breakage. Nothing beats poultry for providing protein, along with hair-healthy zinc, iron, and B vitamins to keep strands strong and plentiful. Because hair is nearly all protein, foods rich in protein are literally the building blocks for great hair. Lean cuts of beef are another good source of protein. Although maintaining a healthy diet is an excellent way to get the vitamins necessary for healthy hair, taking a vitamin supplement can make it easier to ensure that you are getting all of your daily requirements. The top 5 vitamin supplements you should take for healthy hair are biotin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B5 and Inositol.

Maybe you are an aspiring barber, enjoy fixing broken electronics, are great at taking photos, or like to code in your spare time. Even activities that you consider to be hobbies, such as using Photoshop to edit your photos, could be a service people are willing to pay you for. If you are feeling stuck, go and ask a parent or someone else who knows you well. They might surprise you by pointing out a skill you didn\u2019t even notice you had. A lot of skills you might take for granted, such as the ability to navigate the Internet and other programs such as Word and Photoshop, are actually very difficult for older people to pick up on. You could offer to help older people learn how to use their computers more effectively or how to use certain programs for an hourly fee. Did you know that there are professional organizers, who work to clean or organize homes, office spaces, and more? If you are a neat and detail-oriented person, de-cluttering other people\u2019s living spaces could be a perfect side job. If photography is a hobby of yours, you could offer to be an official photographer for a birthday party, wedding, or other kind of celebration. Many people hire photographers for special events and pay well for it too. If you know any professional photographers, ask them to take you along on their next photo shoot so you can watch and learn. If you know how to make logos or fliers, these are great skills you could offer to help out a local business. Don\u2019t be afraid to walk into a store and ask to talk to the manager. Be sure to emphasize what specific skills you could offer to help their business grow. Maybe you have a specific interest but know that you don\u2019t have the necessary experience to find work in that area quite yet. A paid internship could be a great opportunity because, not only will you earn money, but you will also be getting paid to learn about your passion and gain valuable work experience. Ask at your school, local businesses, or online to find internships. For example, if you\u2019re interested in botany, you could try visiting different florists, botanical gardens, and the like to see if they would be willing to take on an intern. Did you grow up speaking two or more languages? If so, you\u2019ve already got an incredible skill others have to spend years learning. You might be surprised to learn how many people need help translating bills and other documents or even in everyday conversations. Again, word of mouth can work wonders along with hanging up fliers and advertising online. Once you have found someone interested in your service, negotiate a fair rate. Ask around or check online to find out what the average going rates are. If you are just starting out, you may want to charge less in the beginning. Getting exposure and experience are more important at the beginning stage. Once you have a satisfied customer base, you can start charging more for your services. Once you start getting clients, ask them for testimonials or if they would be willing to serve as references.  As a middle schooler, you may run into people who doubt your abilities because you are young. Having references will be extremely useful as they prove that you are serious about your work.

We celebrated at a very nice restaurant located in the Arts District of Downtown LA that my Dad had never been to. Upon finishing our meal he remarked that he had grown up within walking distance of the restaurant. Considering we had time to kill before the movie we had planned to see later, Dad decided to show us the house where he spent several of his formative years. My dad is a natural storyteller and he's immensely proud of his hometown so it was an extra gift in itself to see and hear him gesticulate and intone about stories from his childhood and which friends used to live where and what kind of misadventures he got himself into as a young boy. Our kids were very taken by some of the mischief my dad would get into, like shining the shoes of local gangsters, or ducking away from the school bullies by running across he rooftops and sometimes jumping from roof to roof over great heights to escape a beating. They laughed at his comedic embellishments, and they were more than a little incredulous at his fierce independence and feisty spirit, considering Dad was telling them how he was basically given free reign as a five year old to explore his surroundings by himself. He told us several intimate personal details like how strained his relationship was with his stern and often emotionally cold father and how he would find solace and understanding in the warmth of his mom. He also mentioned details about the day she died when Dad was only sixteen, which he very rarely does. This cross generational sharing is very important to my wife and I. It gives our kids perspectives into their own lives and a sense of history as to where they come. It also gives them insight into their own emotional makeup and personal perspectives. Our kids have a strong moral center, and a \"can do\" attitude when it comes to fixing their own problems. I think it's very valuable for them to know that the are values that we have tried very hard to instill in them in order to make them strong and productive members of society working for the public good. When you're young you think that birthdays are all about the cake, the presents, and the celebration of yourself, and in many ways those aspects are very important to my family. But as I get older I find that the only thing I really want is to be secure in the knowledge that my family knows how tight and lasting our connections are to each other and how our common bonds come from a place of great emotional depth.

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are occasionally prone to generating responses that, while coherent and seemingly in line with given instructions, diverge from the truth - a phenomenon aptly termed as \"hallucinations\" (Ji et al., 2023a). Such inaccuracies not only compromise the reliability of LLMs but also pose significant challenges for their application in critical domains. The root causes of these hallucinations remain a subject of ongoing investigation. Factors contributing to this issue may include the models\u2019 overreliance on their own outputs, the preference for generating fluent text at the expense of accuracy, and the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the knowledge amassed during their training phase. The implications of hallucinations are profound, potentially facilitating the dissemination of misinformation, diminishing trust in AI technologies, and causing detrimental effects when employed in sensitive decision-making contexts. In addressing this challenge, specially within the context of Question Answering (QA), the academic community has dedicated considerable effort towards devising strategies to curtail the occurrence of hallucinations. Prior studies (Qiu et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023; Kai et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024) have illustrated that it is feasible to significantly mitigate hallucinations without necessitating extensive structural modifications or comprehensive retraining of the models. Nevertheless, many of these approaches either implicitly adjust the behavior of LLMs within the latent space or aim to suppress the tendency of outputting unfaithful results during the decoding phase, essentially treating LLMs as opaque entities. Contrary to these approaches, our research introduces a novel approach that emphasizes the fidelity of responses through the meticulous design of explicit loss functions during the fine-tuning process, named as Faithful Finetuning (F2). We first decompose the conventional QA objective into two explicit sub-objectives: internal fact retrieval and factgrounded QA, thus informing the LLM to effectively leverage their internal knowledge for faithful answers. Then, we design a targeted fine-tuning approach to guide the model focusing on the hotspots identified by the entity-based and attention-based heuristics within the retrieved fact spans.

As a multidisciplinary field, NLP integrates linguistics, computer science, and mathematics with the aim of realizing the mutual transformation between human language and computer data. Its ultimate objective is to empower computers with the capability to process and \"understand\" natural language, thereby facilitating tasks such as automatic translation, text categorization, and sentiment analysis. The complexity of NLP is evident in the numerous steps it encompasses, including word segmentation, partof-speech tagging, parsing, stemming, named entity recognition, and more, all of which contribute to the challenge of replicating human language understanding in artificial intelligence systems. Traditional natural language processing tasks typically employ statistic-based algorithms (Hogenboom et al., 2010) (Serra et al., 2013) (AussenacGilles and S\u00f6rgel, 2005) and deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN) (Yin et al., 2017), recurrent neural network (RNN) (Banerjee et al., 2019), long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Yao and Guan, 2018), and others. Recently, with the advent of the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as a leading representative of natural language processing, its popularity has grown significantly. The transformer architecture, as a prominent large language model (Lewis et al., 2019) (Raffel et al., 2020) in the natural language processing domain, has consistently demonstrated enhanced performance, attracting the attention of an increasing number of researchers who are engaged in studying its capabilities. The most prevalent LMs nowadays are the GPT families (Radford et al., 2019) (Brown et al., 2020) (Achiam et al., 2023) and Bert families (Liu et al., 2019) (Devlin et al., 2018) (Sanh et al., 2019), which have been demonstrated to excel in a multitude of natural language processing tasks. Among these, the AutoEncoder language model is particularly adept at natural language understanding tasks,             \fFigure 1: A general overview of this survey\u2018s work while the AutoRegressive language model is more suited to natural language generation tasks. While increasing parameters (Touvron et al., 2023b) and model tuning (Han et al., 2023) can enhance the performance of LLMs, the phenomenon of \"hallucination\" (Ji et al., 2023) persists. Furthermore, the limitations of LMs in effectively handling knowledgeintensive work (Feng et al., 2023) and their inability to promptly update their knowledge (Mousavi et al., 2024) are consistently apparent. Consequently, numerous researchers (Lewis et al., 2020) (Izacard and Grave, 2020b) (Khandelwal et al., 2019) have employed the technique of retrieval to obtain external knowledge, which can assist the language model in attaining enhanced performance in a multitude of tasks. Currently, there is a paucity of surveys on the use of retrieval augmentation to enhance the performance of LLMs. Zhao et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive overview of work on RAG for multimodality. Zhao et al. (2024a) concentrate on the utilisation of retrieval augmentation generation techniques for the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) domain. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent RAG work, but it does not cover all relevant domains. Additionally, the article lacks sufficient detail to provide a comprehensive timeline of the overall development. Gao et al. (2023) investigate the enhancement of RAG for large models. This article summarizes some of the recent RAG work, but it introduces the retrievers and generators independently, which is not conducive to the upgrading and interactions with the components of subsequent work. Li et al. (2022b) focus on text generation only. The article has fewer figures and tables, and the content \fis more abstract, which is not conducive to the reader\u2019s understanding. Also, surveys on RAG only tells half of the story in retrieval-augmented methods in NLP. Not only do tasks associated with NLG require retrieval enhancement techniques, but NLU tasks also necessitate external information. To date, there is a scarcity of comprehensive surveys that thoroughly review the application of augmented retrieval techniques across the spectrum of NLP. In order to improve the current situation, this paper presents the following contributions: (1) The article does not merely focus on the work related to RAG; it also places significant emphasis on RALM and aligns with the concept of NLP. The work related to generation aligns with NLG, while the rest of the work aligns with NLU. (2) The two components of RALM, the Retriever and the Language Model, are described in detail, and the different interaction modes of these two components are precisely defined for the first time. (3) A comprehensive overview of the RALM work schedule is provided, along with a summary of the common and novel applications of current RALM, accompanied by an analysis of the associated limitations. Potential solutions to these limitations are proposed, along with recommendations for future research directions. Figure 1 provides a general overview of the framework of RALM methods. The following is a summary of the paper: Section 2 defines RALM. Section 3 provides a detailed classification and summary of the work of retrievers in RALM. Section 4 provides a detailed classification and summary of the work of LMs in RALM. Section 5 provides a classification and summary of specific enhancements to RALM. Section 6 of RALM is a classification and summary of the sources of retrieved data. Section 7 is a summary of RALM applications. Section 8 is a summary of RALM evaluations and benchmarks.

The most prevalent LMs nowadays are the GPT families (Radford et al., 2019) (Brown et al., 2020) (Achiam et al., 2023) and Bert families (Liu et al., 2019) (Devlin et al., 2018) (Sanh et al., 2019), which have been demonstrated to excel in a multitude of natural language processing tasks. Among these, the AutoEncoder language model is particularly adept at natural language understanding tasks,             \fFigure 1: A general overview of this survey\u2018s work while the AutoRegressive language model is more suited to natural language generation tasks. While increasing parameters (Touvron et al., 2023b) and model tuning (Han et al., 2023) can enhance the performance of LLMs, the phenomenon of \"hallucination\" (Ji et al., 2023) persists. Furthermore, the limitations of LMs in effectively handling knowledgeintensive work (Feng et al., 2023) and their inability to promptly update their knowledge (Mousavi et al., 2024) are consistently apparent.

This article summarizes some of the recent RAG work, but it introduces the retrievers and generators independently, which is not conducive to the upgrading and interactions with the components of subsequent work. Li et al. (2022b) focus on text generation only. The article has fewer figures and tables, and the content \fis more abstract, which is not conducive to the reader\u2019s understanding.

As a multidisciplinary field, NLP integrates linguistics, computer science, and mathematics with the aim of realizing the mutual transformation between human language and computer data. Its ultimate objective is to empower computers with the capability to process and \"understand\" natural language, thereby facilitating tasks such as automatic translation, text categorization, and sentiment analysis. The complexity of NLP is evident in the numerous steps it encompasses, including word segmentation, partof-speech tagging, parsing, stemming, named entity recognition, and more, all of which contribute to the challenge of replicating human language understanding in artificial intelligence systems. Traditional natural language processing tasks typically employ statistic-based algorithms (Hogenboom et al., 2010) (Serra et al., 2013) (AussenacGilles and S\u00f6rgel, 2005) and deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN) (Yin et al., 2017), recurrent neural network (RNN) (Banerjee et al., 2019), long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Yao and Guan, 2018), and others.

However, the best-performing language models work well for English but have inferior capabilities in other languages. A common method to improve the capabilities of other languages is to continually pre-train and finetune *Equal contribution. the English model for other languages (Conneau and Lample, 2019). This approach builds upon the capabilities acquired through large-scale English pre-training and focuses on aligning the English and other language spaces, making efficient re-use of compute and data resources (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). One of the major challenges for LLM adaptation is the lack of vocabulary coverage in the original model\u2019s tokenizer for the new language. This would mean the inability to represent the new language if the vocabulary is totally different or inefficient tokenization with high fertility in the case of inadequate vocabulary representation. A solution is to expand the tokenizer to incorporate new vocabulary and then perform continual pre-training on monolingual data from the new language to adapt the model to the new language (Cui et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023; Minixhofer et al., 2022). In this scenario, an important question is: How do we initialize the embeddings of the new vocabulary items? Various methods have been proposed in the literature for the initialization of the new token embeddings, from simple random initialization (Antoun et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020) to the mean of embeddings (Gee et al., 2022) to sophisticated methods such as OFA among others (Minixhofer et al., 2022; Dobler and de Melo, 2023; Tran, 2020; Liu et al., 2024) that learn the new embeddings as a function of existing embeddings using external resources and tools like cross-lingual word-vectors and bilingual dictionaries. However, there is no theoretical basis for what constitutes a good initialization. Furthermore, in existing works, comparisons with simple, naive initialization methods across different model sizes are missing. In this paper, we theoretically define and analyze the properties of a good initialization. We prove that initializing embeddings of new vocabulary embeddings to be in the convex hull of original 22 l u J ] L C . s c [ v45.02 : v i X r a             \fembeddings ensures that the greedy generation of the existing language(s) is not impacted by the new vocabulary items on initialization. Based on these insights, we propose a simple learnable initialization approach which we dub as Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V) which ensures initializations in the convex hull without needing cross-lingual embeddings. We conducted a comparative analysis of CW2V alongside 5 existing initialization strategies including OFA on two models containing varying parameters, namely RoBERTa (125M) and LLaMa2 (7B), examining their impact through 5 downstream tasks across 4 languages. Our analysis of various initialization methods demonstrates that CW2V achieves better if not comparable performance with the previous best methods.

Prior months to this date all 3 of my dogs were fine and healthy, running and playing like any normal dogs would and should. One day in May my Black Lab started to limp slightly but nothing to serious and worrisome, considering my 3 dogs played rough and wild we thought it was just a minor injury. A week went by and the limp was getting noticeably worse. My mom and i became concerned and soon after called and schedule a Vet appointment for the following week. The day finally came to take my dog, to the vet, thinking it was a minor issue my vet gave her a quick look and basically said she was fine and just hurt her back jumping. At that point i was not to concerned thinking he knew exactly what he was talking about. Another week went by and the limp got even worse. Again we took her back to the Vet, this time he had done an X-ray. Days later the results of the X-ray came back and he said she had a slight disc slip in her back, that has been there a while but nothing that should be causing the limp, he gave her medication for inflammation and sent us on our way. A few days went by and at this point nothing he gave her was helping and no answers that we were looking for came about. Finally we decided to take her to a specialist Vet who does all kind of blood testing and jelly scans and better testing. My family and I walked in that day to the specialist thinking that we were going to pay for our dog to get any surgery she needed to help her limp. After hours of waiting for her blood test results and scan results we finally got our answer, our dog had cancer. We were crush, our lives were shattered the moment we heard she had spleen cancer. For a single moment we were excited to find out that surgery could be done for 10 thousand dollars that we were 100000% willing to pay, but only if the cancer has not spread into her lymph nodes. Upon a few further tests the Vets found that it had spread all through out her body and lymph nodes. That night and the next day we said our goodbyes at that point she was no longer able to walk. This was the worst day of my life, i cry everyday still thinking about her. My life forever changed this day, my attention is constantly with my other 2 dogs who lost their best friend.

You will, however, be able to access the files of the main account. If the user you're trying to hack is a local user (e.g., a user added to the computer by a Microsoft account), you can change their password like you could in previous Windows renditions. You will need a Windows 10 installation medium such as an installation CD in order to perform this method. If you don't have an installation CD, you can create an installation USB drive by doing the following:  Plug an 8 gigabyte (or larger) USB drive into your computer. Open the Windows 10 download page. Click Download tool now  Double-click the downloaded tool. Follow the on-screen prompts to install the tool to your flash drive. Place the installation CD in the disk drive, or insert the USB flash drive into one of the computer's USB ports. .

Your BIOS key will depend on the manufacturer of your computer's motherboard, but common keys include the function keys (e.g., F2), the Esc key, and the Del key. If you don't know which key to press or hold, consult your computer's BIOS documentation by searching for your computer's model, the word \"bios\", and the word \"key\". Again, this will vary depending on your computer's BIOS; you'll usually open the Boot or Advanced tab, use the arrow keys to select your CD drive or USB drive, and press the + key to move the drive up to the top of the list. As with any BIOS problems, you should consult your BIOS documentation online if you have any trouble. Press the \"Save and Exit\" key as specified by your BIOS legend, then confirm by pressing another key if prompted. Your computer will resume rebooting, at which point you should see the installation menu appear. Press \u21e7 Shift+F10 to do so.

This will ensure that Windows reboots to the login screen rather than back into the installation setup. If you're using an installation CD, you'll need to eject the CD before entering the reboot command. Click the \"Utility Manager\" icon, which resembles a dial with a right-facing arrow in the middle. Since you replaced Utility Manager with Command Prompt, doing this will open Command Prompt in administrator mode. You can add a new administrator account by doing the following:  Type in net user name /add making sure to replace \"name\" with a username of your choice. Press \u21b5 Enter.

Give your loved one the opportunity to air his or her grievances about academic problems. Being able to express oneself in this way can be incredibly soothing. Plus, allowing your loved one to vent shows that you care.  Demonstrate active listening by turning to face the person and making regular eye contact. Nod your head or make appropriate sounds to show you\u2019re listening, such as \u201cuh-huh.\u201d When the person is done talking, try to reflect back what he or she has said using emotion. For example, you might say \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re really angry about your performance on the test.\u201d At this point, simply let the person talk. Refrain from trying to \u201cfix\u201d the problem just yet. One humbling way to support your friend during this tough circumstance is to share a situation in which you struggled. It might pertain to academics or it might merely be an anecdote about a different obstacle you have to overcome. Just make sure that the message is clear, and that you don't make yourself seem better than your friend. It may be scary at first to open up and tell someone about a difficulty you faced. However, it\u2019s important to note that sharing your story may help your friend see that everyone encounters hardships and that it\u2019s entirely possible to succeed despite setbacks. Although you can\u2019t fix the situation, there may be something you can do to help the person through it. Are you good in the subject that he or she is struggling in? Perhaps you could casually offer some tips on how to improve. Do you have pretty good study skills? Maybe you can share some of those nuggets of wisdom with your friend. Keep in mind that your friend may not want your help. Instead of thinking in advance of how you will help, simply ask \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d and see what the person\u2019s response is. If he or she wants help from you, let them make a specific request. That way you don\u2019t put your foot in your mouth by coming off like you\u2019re superior. Give your loved one a much-needed self-esteem boost. It\u2019s normal for someone\u2019s self-esteem to take a hit after performing poorly in school. Take a moment to offer a sincere compliment on some other attribute. Remind the person what else he or she has going despite having a bad grade. You can say something like \u201cI know it sucks that you got an F in math. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to worry about that in English. You\u2019re the best student in that class!\u201d Just make sure the compliment is true and the person knows you\u2019re not just saying it to make them feel better. If your friend is upset over bad grades, the very best comfort you can offer is your presence. Just be there. Extend a shoulder for them, if they\u2019d like. It\u2019s not really your job to fix the situation or make it better in any way, really.

Nod your head or make appropriate sounds to show you\u2019re listening, such as \u201cuh-huh.\u201d When the person is done talking, try to reflect back what he or she has said using emotion. For example, you might say \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re really angry about your performance on the test.\u201d At this point, simply let the person talk. Refrain from trying to \u201cfix\u201d the problem just yet. One humbling way to support your friend during this tough circumstance is to share a situation in which you struggled. It might pertain to academics or it might merely be an anecdote about a different obstacle you have to overcome. Just make sure that the message is clear, and that you don't make yourself seem better than your friend. It may be scary at first to open up and tell someone about a difficulty you faced. However, it\u2019s important to note that sharing your story may help your friend see that everyone encounters hardships and that it\u2019s entirely possible to succeed despite setbacks. Although you can\u2019t fix the situation, there may be something you can do to help the person through it. Are you good in the subject that he or she is struggling in? Perhaps you could casually offer some tips on how to improve. Do you have pretty good study skills? Maybe you can share some of those nuggets of wisdom with your friend. Keep in mind that your friend may not want your help. Instead of thinking in advance of how you will help, simply ask \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d and see what the person\u2019s response is. If he or she wants help from you, let them make a specific request. That way you don\u2019t put your foot in your mouth by coming off like you\u2019re superior. Give your loved one a much-needed self-esteem boost. It\u2019s normal for someone\u2019s self-esteem to take a hit after performing poorly in school. Take a moment to offer a sincere compliment on some other attribute. Remind the person what else he or she has going despite having a bad grade. You can say something like \u201cI know it sucks that you got an F in math. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to worry about that in English. You\u2019re the best student in that class!\u201d Just make sure the compliment is true and the person knows you\u2019re not just saying it to make them feel better. If your friend is upset over bad grades, the very best comfort you can offer is your presence. Just be there. Extend a shoulder for them, if they\u2019d like. It\u2019s not really your job to fix the situation or make it better in any way, really. It\u2019s up to your friend to deal with poor grades, but he or she will certainly appreciate you showing support and acknowledging that it\u2019s a sucky situation.\n", "improve": [3]}}

However, quality assessments of released LLMs generally lack references to previous research and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that the research community has used for systematic evaluation and monitoring of scientific progress for various languages and tasks. Several research initiatives have evaluated these large models\u2019 performance on standard NLP and speech processing tasks. The HELM project (Liang et al., 2022) assessed English LLMs across various metrics and scenarios. BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2023) introduced a large-scale evaluation with 214 tasks, including low-resource languages. GPT2.5 (Radford et al., 2019), ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), were recently evaluated by Bang et al. (2023); Ahuja et al. (2023); Hendy et al. (2023); Khondaker et al. (2023). Large speech models such as Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) and Universal Speech Model (USM) (Zhang et al., 2023) were also explored for speech recognition and translation tasks. Initiatives such as SUPERB (Yang et al., 2021) were introduced to support benchmarking tools and leaderboards for several speech-related tasks. Bubeck et al.

Their results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates a higher level of general intelligence compared to its predecessors. LAraBench study fulfills an important objective of assessing the LLMs capabilities for supporting Arabic language processing tasks, for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), at the same level of depth and breadth as for English tasks. Our evaluation involves 61 publicly available datasets and 98 test setups used to perform and evaluate language processing tasks in both MSA and dialectal Arabic across various genres (e.g., news articles, tweets, meetings, telephony, and broadcast content). Our evaluation focuses on assessing the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Jais-13bchat (Sengupta et al., 2023)2 and BLOOMZ (176B) for NLP tasks, and of Whisper (Large, 1.55B) and USM (2B) for Speech processing, in both zero and few-shot settings. We investigate: (i) can LLMs effectively perform Arabic NLP and Speech processing tasks without prior task-specific knowledge (zero-shot)? (ii) how does performance vary across tasks with different complexities in zero- and fewshot settings? (iii) how do LLMs compare to current SOTA models, and are open LLMs as effective as the commercially available (closed) models? Our investigation reveals unique insights about LLMs\u2019 performance on Arabic NLP and Speech tasks: A. Zero-shot Multi-task Performer. GPT-4 outperforms other models in majority of the NLP tasks (see Figure 1). However, a large performance gap between GPT-4 and SOTA models remains due to the higher quality SOTA models. For speech tasks, USM outperforms all the Whisper variants and performs comparably with SOTA. B. Few-shot and SOTA. GPT-4 reduces the performance gap with SOTA in the few-shot (only 3-shots) setting (see Figure 1). This significant performance gain is noticed for almost all tasks, particularly for more complex semantic and questionanswering tasks compared to syntactic and segmentation tasks. Similarly, Whisper models exhibit promising results in speech recognition with just 2 hours of speech examples in few-shot finetuning. Open models (BLOOMZ and Whisper) performed poorly w.r.t. to their commercially available counterparts. However, fine-tuning with more instruc2We benchmarked Jais model on seven datasets using a zero-shot setting. tions may help these open models to achieve closer performance to SOTA and other closed LLMs. C. MSA vs Dialect. The gaps in LLMs\u2019 performance between MSA and dialectal datasets (e.g., for machine translation (MT) and speech recognition task) are more pronounced, indicating ineffectiveness of LLMs for under-represented dialects. D. Hallucination and Data Contamination. GPT models, specially GPT-3.5, suffer from the hallucination problem. We noticed the model insert extra information (e.g., for MT task with Bible dataset) from its parametric memory. Benchmarking LLMs raises concerns about their exposure to existing datasets. In our study, we utilized datasets that were released after the cut-off date of GPT\u2019s training (September 2021). Moreover, we applied a prompt-based method with guided instructions (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023) on nine datasets using GPT-4, to determine if datasets are contaminated. Our experiments revealed that GPT-4 could not produce any examples from these datasets. To the best of our knowledge, LAraBench is the first comprehensive effort that includes commercial (close) and open source LLMs and evaluates zeroand few-shot settings for a wide range of Arabic NLP and Speech tasks. It is the first to include the evaluation of Whisper and USM models for Arabic ASR and the first to report benchmarks for a standard Arabic TTS generative model.

Arrange the time a day or two in advance to make sure that you have time to prepare. Right before your discussion, make sure to turn off the TV, radio, or anything else that could distract from your talk. Begin your presentation by telling your parents what type of bird you want and list some of the things you like about it. Talk about the positive qualities of this bird (e.g. that it is a lively and entertaining). Mention the reason why you think this bird would be a good addition to the family.  For instance, tell your parents that you want a pet cockatiel because cockatiels are intelligent, friendly, quieter than other birds, and family-friendly. To make sure you give a detailed presentation and don\u2019t forget anything, write down everything that you are telling your parents and read it out to them. If you wish, give them a booklet with all of your points and research listed clearly. Tell your parents exactly how much the bird you want will cost and where it is available. Contact local pet stores to see what birds they have available and what prices they are being sold for. If you can, visit the store to see which bird you like best and get pricing information in person. Show your parents that you have done a lot of research about the bird you want by telling them exactly what kind of indoor cage it will require. As a general rule, smaller birds like finches or canaries require a minimum of 1000 square centimeters in floor area, while larger birds like parrots need 15,000 square centimeters. Write down the specifications for the cage you need, and look into stores that sell cages like it. Look into a travel cage as well, for use in case of vet visits or emergencies. Outline the tasks that you will do regularly to care for the bird that you wish to get. For instance, note that you will feed it and change the lining of its cage daily (which is required for proper hygiene). Doing so may reassure your parents that they will not be the ones left to take care of the bird all the time. Research the type of bird you want, and then write a sample menu for what you would feed it in a given week to keep it healthy and satisfied. In general, birds are healthiest when fed high quality pellet food, with a side of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Take note that, contrary to popular belief, seeds are fattening and not as nutritious as other bird foods. Show that your bird\u2019s health and well-being will be important to you by writing down a list of local avian veterinarians. In addition, write down any walk-in or emergency veterinary clinics that treat birds. You should also look up a number for poison control, in the event that your bird ingests something potentially toxic. To find an avian veterinarian near you, visit the Association of Avian Veterinarian\u2019s website at http://www.aav.org/search/custom.asp?id=1803. Try to guess what arguments your parents will give for not wanting to get a bird and write them down. Come up with answers and solutions to these concerns beforehand so you are prepared. If you have a well-informed response to their concerns, you will prove that you have done a lot of research and thought things through.  For instance, if you think your parents will be worried about a bird chewing wires or getting caught in a ceiling fan, show them a plan for bird-proofing certain rooms in the house (i.e. hiding or covering wires, closing windows and doors).\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.25, "base": 0.25, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter2": 0.25, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bird\", 10, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"e.g.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"i.e.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(8, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"pet\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"bird\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"want\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1080, "ori_file_path": 1080, "source": "wle_502"}, "input_content": "Ask your parents to sit down with you for a discussion during a time when they won\u2019t be distracted (e.g. after supper, before the evening news).

After a long time spent on Earth, however, the iron metal in the meteorite will turn to rust, leaving the meteorite a rusty brown.  This rusting starts out as small red and orange spots on the surface of the meteorite that slowly expand to cover more and more of the rock. You may still be able to see the black crust even if part of it has begun to rust.  The meteorite may be black in color but with slight variations (e.g., steely bluish black). However, if the rock you\u2019ve found isn\u2019t at all close to black or brown in color, then it is not a meteorite. Contrary to what you might expect, most meteorites are not round. Instead, they are typically quite irregular, with sides of varying size and shape. Although some meteorites may develop a conical shape, most will not appear aerodynamic once they land.  Although irregular in shape, most meteorites will have edges that are rounded rather than sharp.  If the rock you\u2019ve found is relatively normal in shape, or is round like a ball, it may still be a meteorite. However, the vast majority of meteorites are irregular in shape. As rocks pass through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, their surfaces begin to melt and air pressure forces the molten material back, leaving a featureless, melt-like surface called a fusion crust. If your rock\u2019s surface looks like it has melted and shifted, it may be a meteorite.  A fusion crust will most likely be smooth and featureless, though it may also include ripple marks and \u201cdroplets\u201d where molten stone had moved and resolidified. If your rock does not have a fusion crust, it is most likely not a meteorite. The fusion crust may look like a black eggshell coating the rock.  Rocks in the desert will sometimes develop a shiny black exterior that looks similar to fusion crust. If you found your rock in a desert environment, consider whether its black surface might be desert varnish. Flow lines are small streaks on the fusion crust from when the crust was molten and was forced backwards. If your rock has a crust-like surface with small streak lines across it, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a meteorite. Flow lines may be small or not immediately apparent to the naked eye, as the lines can be broken or not completely straight. Use a magnifying glass and a discerning eye when looking for flow lines on the surface of a rock. Although the surface of a meteorite is generally featureless, it may also include shallow pits and deep cavities that resemble thumbprints. Look for these on your rock to determine both if it\u2019s a meteorite and what type of meteorite it is.  Iron meteorites are particularly susceptible to irregular melting and will have deeper, more defined cavities, whereas stony meteorites may have craters that are smooth like the rock\u2019s surface.  These indentations are technically known as \u201cregmaglypts,\u201d though most people who work with meteorites will suffice to call them \u201cthumbprints.\u201d Although craters and cavities on the surface may indicate that your rock is a meteorite, no meteorite has holes in its interior. Meteorites are dense pieces of solid rock; if the rock you\u2019ve found is porous or bubbly in appearance, it\u2019s unfortunately not a meteorite.  If the rock you\u2019ve found has holes in the surface, or appears \u201cbubbly\u201d as if it was once molten, it is definitely not a meteorite.  Slag from industrial processes is often confused for meteorites, although slag has a porous surface. Other commonly mistaken types of rock include lava rocks and black limestone rocks. If you\u2019re having trouble discerning between holes and regmaglypts, it may be useful to view side-by-side comparisons of these features online to learn how to spot the difference.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.33333333333333337, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": [], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1364, "ori_file_path": 1364, "source": "wle_786"}, "input_content": "If the rock you\u2019ve found is a freshly fallen meteorite, it will be black and shiny as a result of having burned through the atmosphere.

If your rock\u2019s surface looks like it has melted and shifted, it may be a meteorite.  A fusion crust will most likely be smooth and featureless, though it may also include ripple marks and \u201cdroplets\u201d where molten stone had moved and resolidified. If your rock does not have a fusion crust, it is most likely not a meteorite. The fusion crust may look like a black eggshell coating the rock.  Rocks in the desert will sometimes develop a shiny black exterior that looks similar to fusion crust. If you found your rock in a desert environment, consider whether its black surface might be desert varnish. Flow lines are small streaks on the fusion crust from when the crust was molten and was forced backwards. If your rock has a crust-like surface with small streak lines across it, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a meteorite. Flow lines may be small or not immediately apparent to the naked eye, as the lines can be broken or not completely straight. Use a magnifying glass and a discerning eye when looking for flow lines on the surface of a rock. Although the surface of a meteorite is generally featureless, it may also include shallow pits and deep cavities that resemble thumbprints. Look for these on your rock to determine both if it\u2019s a meteorite and what type of meteorite it is.  Iron meteorites are particularly susceptible to irregular melting and will have deeper, more defined cavities, whereas stony meteorites may have craters that are smooth like the rock\u2019s surface.  These indentations are technically known as \u201cregmaglypts,\u201d though most people who work with meteorites will suffice to call them \u201cthumbprints.\u201d Although craters and cavities on the surface may indicate that your rock is a meteorite, no meteorite has holes in its interior. Meteorites are dense pieces of solid rock; if the rock you\u2019ve found is porous or bubbly in appearance, it\u2019s unfortunately not a meteorite.  If the rock you\u2019ve found has holes in the surface, or appears \u201cbubbly\u201d as if it was once molten, it is definitely not a meteorite.  Slag from industrial processes is often confused for meteorites, although slag has a porous surface. Other commonly mistaken types of rock include lava rocks and black limestone rocks.

After a long time spent on Earth, however, the iron metal in the meteorite will turn to rust, leaving the meteorite a rusty brown.  This rusting starts out as small red and orange spots on the surface of the meteorite that slowly expand to cover more and more of the rock. You may still be able to see the black crust even if part of it has begun to rust.  The meteorite may be black in color but with slight variations (e.g., steely bluish black). However, if the rock you\u2019ve found isn\u2019t at all close to black or brown in color, then it is not a meteorite. Contrary to what you might expect, most meteorites are not round. Instead, they are typically quite irregular, with sides of varying size and shape. Although some meteorites may develop a conical shape, most will not appear aerodynamic once they land.

Conversely, for some people, not blinking and opening the eyes as wide as is comfortable actually discourages tears from forming by tensing the muscles in and around the eye area.  Only practice will tell you which group you fall into. Because your tear ducts stem from the side of your nose to an opening in the eyelid, pinching the bridge of your nose and the sides while clamping your eyes closed can block the tear ducts. (This works best if used before tears begin to flow.) Studies have shown that smiling has a positive impact on emotional health. It also positively impact the way others view you. What's more, the act of smiling counteracts the symptoms of crying, making it easier for you to prevent tears. One way to dial back intense, unpleasant emotions is to take a moment to splash cold water on your face.  Not only does it relax you, but it can boost your energy and make you more attentive. You can also drip cold water on your wrists and dab it behind you ears.  Major arteries run through these areas just below the skin surface and cooling them can have a calming effect on the whole body. Research has shown that green tea contains L-Theanine, which can promote relaxation and decrease tension while also increasing awareness and focus.  So the next time you find yourself overwhelmed, with tears welling up, treat yourself to a cup of green tea. Black tea also contains L-Theanine, but not as much. Laughter is an easy, inexpensive form of therapy that can improve your overall health and decrease feelings that lead to crying or depression. Find something that makes you laugh and give yourself some much needed relief. Crying occurs often as a product of prolonged tension.This process allows your body to relax tense muscles and calm your thinking.  It is also a cognitive activity because it teaches you to recognize how your body feels when you are upset and tense versus when you are relaxed and calm. Starting at your toes, begin tensing the muscle groups of your body one at a time for 30 second intervals, working your way slowly upward to the head. This activity also has the added benefit of relieving insomnia and restless sleep. Research suggests that feelings of helplessness and passivity are often at the root of episodes of crying.  To prevent crying, shift your body from passive to active.  This can be something as simple as getting up and walking around the room, or opening and closing your hands with a slight squeeze to engage your muscles and remind your body that your actions are voluntary and you are in control.. (If you find yourself causing bruising or other physical harm, it is recommended that you discontinue this method and attempt to use one or more of the other tactics.) Physical pain distracts your senses from the root of your emotional pain, making you less likely to cry.

The clothing should not show signs of wear and tear. They should also be free of wrinkles so that they look nicer. The best rule of thumb for selling used baby clothing is to look at it from the buyer's point of view and decide if it is in good enough shape to purchase. Another key aspect to selling baby clothes is how they are presented to the buyers. Tossing all of the baby clothes in boxes or containers does not make an appealing presentation.  At stores, the clothing is neatly folded and arranged on tables or hung on hangers, so the family should try to do something similar. If the clothes are folded and put on a table, they should be a bit spread out so that they are easier to look at. Of course, the neatly arranged clothes on a table are likely to get disrupted, but it is not difficult to tidy them up throughout the yard sale time. In order to simulate a store even more, it is also a great idea to have bags available.  After a purchase is made, the family can put the bought clothes in the bag so they can be more easily carried by the buyers. Yard sales work for many families, but they can also be a disappointment if the sale location is off the main path and no one stops to look at the items.  In order to help get potential customers, the family can post signs in the neighborhood or even put an advertisement in a local newspaper. It is very important to include the address, date, and time span for the sale so that people know where and when it is. If the location is on a small side street, it can be helpful to also list the name of the closest main street that connects to the side street. For a yard sale, the family determines the cost of the items they are selling, but often leave a bit of bargaining room for those customers that want to make a deal.  Prices can either be on signs or on tags that are gently attached to the clothing. One major concern with selling the outgrown baby clothes in a yard sale is the weather. Advertising has to be done in advance in order to give customers a chance to plan ahead to come to the yard sale, but the weather isn't known for certain very far in advance.

However, the sheer volume of CTRs (e.g., exceeding 400,000 and proliferating) presents a challenge for comprehensive literature assessment when developing treatments (Bastian et al., 2010). Natural Language Inference (NLI) (Bowman et al., 2015) emerges as a promising avenue for large-scale interpretation and retrieval of medical evidence bridging recent findings to facilitate personalized care (DeYoung et al., 2020; Sutton et al., 2020). The SemEval 2024 Task 2 on the Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials (NLI4CT) (Jullien et al., 2024) revolves around annotating statements extracted from breast cancer CTRs1 and determining the inference relation between these statements and corresponding sections of the CTRs, such as Eligibility criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse events. By systematically intervening in the statements, targeting numerical, vocabulary, syntax, and semantic reasoning, the task aims to investigate Large Language Models (LLM)s\u2019 consistency and faithful reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we experiment with Gemini Pro (Team et al., 2023), GPT-3.5 (Brown et al., 2020), Flan-T5 (Longpre et al., 2023) and several pre-trained language models (PLMs) trained on biomedical datasets, namely BioLinkBERT (Yasunaga et al., 2022), SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), ClinicalBERT (Huang et al., 2019). We conducted zero-shot evaluations of Gemini Pro and GPT-3.5, employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework (Lewis et al., 2020) integrating Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning (Yao et al., 2023) facilitating multiple reasoning paths. Our experiments involved applying various instruction templates to guide the generation process. These templates were refined through manual comparison of the labels within the training dataset against those generated by the models. The PLMs were fine-tuned on the provided training dataset, while the Flan-T5 model was assessed under zero-shot conditions. Gemini Pro emerged as the top-performing model among all the experimented models, achieving an F1 score of 0.69, with consistency and faithfulness scores of 0.71 and 0.90, respectively, on the official test dataset. Notably, a comparative analysis between GPT-3.5 and Gemini Pro revealed shortcomings in GPT-3.5\u2019s performance, particularly in instances requiring numerical reasoning.

If you want to find Monarch caterpillars, either plant milkweed in your yard, or explore overgrown land in your area to find plants that are already growing.  The exact appearance of milkweed will vary depending on the variety, but they typically feature a stalk with broad leaves. It\u2019s very easy to identify milkweed if it\u2019s flowering, since the flowers have a distinctive star shape. Also, if the stalk or leaves are damaged, the plant will secrete a milky fluid, which is where it gets the name \u201cmilkweed.\u201d  Milkweed grows in areas where the ground has been disturbed. For example, you might find it growing along a roadside, bike path, or railroad tracks, or you could spot some in a pasture, park, or overgrown garden. Before you head out to look for milkweed plants, do an online search for pictures of the plant, or check a plant identification guide. Once you\u2019ve located a milkweed plant, check it every day starting in the spring. Monarch eggs are yellow, and round, are about the size of a pencil tip, and are usually found on the underside of the leaf. There is typically only 1 egg on a leaf, and often a female monarch will only lay 1 egg on each milkweed plant.  Monarch eggs hatch within 4 or 5 days, so it helps to spot the eggs as early as possible. If you haven\u2019t checked the plant for a few days, you may spot Monarch caterpillars instead of their eggs. Newly-hatched caterpillars will be about the size of a grain of rice, with smooth bodies and faint black, yellow, and white stripes. Older caterpillars will have the same distinct stripes but will be larger, growing up to 1\u20131\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (2.5\u20133.8\u00a0cm) before they transform into a butterfly. To protect the fragile Monarch eggs or newly-hatched larvae, it\u2019s best to leave them on the leaf. Either snap the milkweed stalk with your hands or gently pluck off the leaf containing the egg, then carry it back to your home.  Taking the whole stalk will provide you with plenty of food for your hungry caterpillar, but if you like, you can just gather a few leaves. Remember to check the whole plant to make sure it\u2019s not hiding any other insects or their eggs. If you see anything that's not a monarch caterpillar or egg, either brush away the insect or remove the leaf that contains the egg. To keep the milkweed stalk fresh, wrap the end in wet paper towels, then in aluminum foil. You could also use foam floral tubes if you have access to florist supplies. Once you get the milkweed inside, sprinkle a few drops of water onto a paper towel, then place it in the bottom of a small container, like a glass jar or a food storage container. If you brought the entire stalk of milkweed, carefully snip off the leaf with the egg, then place the leaf egg-side-up into the container.  Cover the container with a lid made of mesh or one that has holes to allow air to circulate. The water on the paper towel will keep the milkweed leaf from drying out. If you found caterpillars that were already hatched, you can move them directly to their permanent enclosure, instead. When the larvae emerge from their eggs, they'll get their food and their water intake by eating the milkweed leaves they were attached to. Adding a few drops of water each day will keep the milkweed from drying out while you wait for the eggs to hatch. Keep doing this until the eggs hatch, which typically takes about 4 days. You can safely wait to move the larvae until they\u2019re about 4 or 5 days old, since they won\u2019t crawl until then. Once they\u2019re 4 or 5 days old, they should be about 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) long, and they\u2019ll be ready to go to their main enclosure. If a caterpillar is crawling on a leaf, you can pick up the whole leaf and move it to a new enclosure. If it's on the bottom or side of the container, gently pick it up with your fingers to move it.  By hatching the eggs in a small container, you\u2019ll be able to keep a close eye on their progress. Also, if you\u2019re raising multiple generations of caterpillars, having a separate container for hatching the eggs will help prevent the spread of illness, since you\u2019ll only be moving healthy caterpillars to the larger enclosure.  If you're worried about damaging the larvae when you move them, lightly moisten the bristles of an artist's paintbrush, then slide each caterpillar onto the brush to transfer it.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"milkweed\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(1, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"milkweed\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1559, "ori_file_path": 1559, "source": "wle_981"}, "input_content": "Monarch caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed plants, and female butterflies lay their eggs on the plants so their larvae will have plenty of food.

Older caterpillars will have the same distinct stripes but will be larger, growing up to 1\u20131\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (2.5\u20133.8\u00a0cm) before they transform into a butterfly. To protect the fragile Monarch eggs or newly-hatched larvae, it\u2019s best to leave them on the leaf. Either snap the milkweed stalk with your hands or gently pluck off the leaf containing the egg, then carry it back to your home.  Taking the whole stalk will provide you with plenty of food for your hungry caterpillar, but if you like, you can just gather a few leaves. Remember to check the whole plant to make sure it\u2019s not hiding any other insects or their eggs. If you see anything that's not a monarch caterpillar or egg, either brush away the insect or remove the leaf that contains the egg. To keep the milkweed stalk fresh, wrap the end in wet paper towels, then in aluminum foil. You could also use foam floral tubes if you have access to florist supplies. Once you get the milkweed inside, sprinkle a few drops of water onto a paper towel, then place it in the bottom of a small container, like a glass jar or a food storage container. If you brought the entire stalk of milkweed, carefully snip off the leaf with the egg, then place the leaf egg-side-up into the container.  Cover the container with a lid made of mesh or one that has holes to allow air to circulate. The water on the paper towel will keep the milkweed leaf from drying out. If you found caterpillars that were already hatched, you can move them directly to their permanent enclosure, instead. When the larvae emerge from their eggs, they'll get their food and their water intake by eating the milkweed leaves they were attached to. Adding a few drops of water each day will keep the milkweed from drying out while you wait for the eggs to hatch. Keep doing this until the eggs hatch, which typically takes about 4 days. You can safely wait to move the larvae until they\u2019re about 4 or 5 days old, since they won\u2019t crawl until then. Once they\u2019re 4 or 5 days old, they should be about 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) long, and they\u2019ll be ready to go to their main enclosure. If a caterpillar is crawling on a leaf, you can pick up the whole leaf and move it to a new enclosure. If it's on the bottom or side of the container, gently pick it up with your fingers to move it.  By hatching the eggs in a small container, you\u2019ll be able to keep a close eye on their progress. Also, if you\u2019re raising multiple generations of caterpillars, having a separate container for hatching the eggs will help prevent the spread of illness, since you\u2019ll only be moving healthy caterpillars to the larger enclosure.  If you're worried about damaging the larvae when you move them, lightly moisten the bristles of an artist's paintbrush, then slide each caterpillar onto the brush to transfer it.\n", "improve": [3]}}

Think about some of the basic types of obstacles and how you might instruct participants when they encounter them.  Having instructions can help prevent injury and make a fair obstacle course. Include specific instructions on how an obstacle is to be completed. For example, participants must go through a tunnel and not over it. A common element of an obstacle course is to feature obstacles that test a persons agility.  These obstacles will require a person to move quickly and accurately to successfully move past it.  Create a well rounded course by including obstacles that test agility.   Running around a series of cones, like a skier slaloming, can be a good test of agility. Try tying small threads with bells attached to them just off the ground.  Participants have to step around them without ringing the bells.  Hanging hula-hoops from a branch can create an obstacle that needs to be hopped or stepped through. Many obstacle courses contain obstacles that require the participants to leap over or around.  Including jumping obstacles can be a great way to make your obstacle course a fun challenge.  Review some of the following ideas to get you started when thinking about your jumping obstacles:  Try setting some targets, such as a hula hoop, on the ground to have people jump towards. Consider a section of the course that has to be done on a pogo stick or bounce ball. Create a high jump obstacle by placing something soft in the path like a hay bale. Doing a series of frog jumps can be a good test of jumping abilities. Balancing obstacles will test the fine movements of participants as they attempt the obstacle.  These obstacles are generally slower paced, requiring graceful and thoughtful motions from those undertaking the obstacle course.  A simple straight board can make a good balance beam. You can require people to stand on one leg for a certain amount of time. Participants might be required to balance a ball on their head for a few seconds. Although many obstacle courses are competitions between individuals, you may want to include obstacles that require teamwork.  Including teamwork can be a great way to get your participants working together to overcome the obstacle course.  Partners might have to throw and catch a ball a certain number of times. The three legged race is a good obstacle that requires team work. Having a \u201chuman wheelbarrow\u201d section of the course can be a good way to include teamwork. Beyond challenging participants agility, speed, and balance your obstacles should also test strength.  Many strength based obstacles will require that some amount of weight be moved or lifted either over a distance or a certain number of times.  You might have a section where people have to do a certain amount of push-ups before continuing. Placing a simple pull up bar or arm hang bar can test upper body strength. Running while carrying something heavy can be a test of full body strength.

If participants don't understand how to proceed when tackling an obstacle they may do so in an unfair or unsafe way.  Think about some of the basic types of obstacles and how you might instruct participants when they encounter them.  Having instructions can help prevent injury and make a fair obstacle course. Include specific instructions on how an obstacle is to be completed. For example, participants must go through a tunnel and not over it. A common element of an obstacle course is to feature obstacles that test a persons agility.  These obstacles will require a person to move quickly and accurately to successfully move past it.  Create a well rounded course by including obstacles that test agility.   Running around a series of cones, like a skier slaloming, can be a good test of agility. Try tying small threads with bells attached to them just off the ground.  Participants have to step around them without ringing the bells.  Hanging hula-hoops from a branch can create an obstacle that needs to be hopped or stepped through. Many obstacle courses contain obstacles that require the participants to leap over or around.  Including jumping obstacles can be a great way to make your obstacle course a fun challenge.  Review some of the following ideas to get you started when thinking about your jumping obstacles:  Try setting some targets, such as a hula hoop, on the ground to have people jump towards. Consider a section of the course that has to be done on a pogo stick or bounce ball. Create a high jump obstacle by placing something soft in the path like a hay bale. Doing a series of frog jumps can be a good test of jumping abilities. Balancing obstacles will test the fine movements of participants as they attempt the obstacle.  These obstacles are generally slower paced, requiring graceful and thoughtful motions from those undertaking the obstacle course.  A simple straight board can make a good balance beam. You can require people to stand on one leg for a certain amount of time. Participants might be required to balance a ball on their head for a few seconds. Although many obstacle courses are competitions between individuals, you may want to include obstacles that require teamwork.  Including teamwork can be a great way to get your participants working together to overcome the obstacle course.  Partners might have to throw and catch a ball a certain number of times. The three legged race is a good obstacle that requires team work. Having a \u201chuman wheelbarrow\u201d section of the course can be a good way to include teamwork. Beyond challenging participants agility, speed, and balance your obstacles should also test strength.  Many strength based obstacles will require that some amount of weight be moved or lifted either over a distance or a certain number of times.  You might have a section where people have to do a certain amount of push-ups before continuing. Placing a simple pull up bar or arm hang bar can test upper body strength. Running while carrying something heavy can be a test of full body strength. Crawling can engage the entire body.\n", "improve": [3]}}

You can\u2019t work to fix the problem unless you know what you are dealing with.  The most common reason for a student to drop out is either they have missed too many days already in the school year or they feel hopeless because they are beyond the point of fixing a failing grade. Both of these situations can be addressed, but the student may not understand this. Other reasons students consider dropping out may include being bullied, a teen pregnancy, depression problems with drugs/alcohol or social problems at school. When you probe to get information about why they are considering dropping out, you have to be prepared for whatever you find out. Instead of getting angry or yelling, offer your support. Ask how you can help.  Being supportive does not mean enabling their behavior. If dropping out seems like a good idea because they simply do not like the responsibility, your student needs to know that if he/she drops out you will expect rent and financial contributions to the household via a job. Some students consider dropping out simply to enjoy their \u201cfreedom\u201d by just staying home. This should not be an option; if they drop out they get a job like other adults do. Dropping out of school is an adult choice. Having a trusted adult they can talk to in order to solve the problem will go a long way to give them hope and a view towards the future.

In an extreme case you may even consider home schooling options, the opportunity to start college classes early or to finish school on-line. Exploring all the academic option will help you to find the best fit to finish school for your student. Children who have good relationships with their parents come to them with problems and listen to their advice.

With your doctor's permission, you can often start stretching in the hospital. Try to stretch at least once a day to get your body ready for exercise. Remember to relax and breathe through the stretches. Keep your joints slightly bent and never locked during stretching to prevent injuries. You should also avoid bouncing your muscles. Instead, stretch smoothly and hold the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat stretches three to four times. Stretching does not improve muscle strength or heart efficiency, but it does improve your flexibility, allow you to do different types of exercises more easily, improve your balance and will relieve muscle tension. Whether you were a marathon runner before the heart attack or a couch potato, your exercise program after a heart attack starts with a walking program. Do a walking warm up for three minutes. Then work up to a pace at which you are breathing heavier than when you\u2019re sitting, but you can still talk and carry on a conversation. Walk for approximately 5 minutes at this pace. Add about one or two minutes to your daily walk each day until you are walking 30 minutes every day.  Walk with a partner for the first several weeks and stay close to home in case you become uncomfortable or very out of breath. Carry a cell phone with you in case you need help from home or to call 911 in case of an emergency. Remember to cool down after your workout. Avoid strenuous activity during the four to six weeks after your heart attack. It takes your heart approximately six weeks to heal enough for moderate to heavy exercise even if you were in fairly good condition before your heart attack. Avoid things like: heavy lifting or pulling, vacuuming, scrubbing, sweeping, painting, running, mowing or sudden bursts of movement. You can start doing things like walking on a flat surface for a few minutes at a time, cooking, washing dishes, shopping, light gardening and light housework.  Increase your exercise time and intensity gradually without ever crossing over into anaerobic exercise. Expect that your leg and arm muscles may be sore in the hours and days following the start of a program. They shouldn't be sore or feel painful during the exercise. Just as if you were starting an exercise program before a heart attack, you\u2019ll want to increase your time and intensity gradually. This will reduce your potential for injury and keep you motivated. Don\u2019t start increasing the time or intensity until your physician has cleared you to do more than walking for 30 minutes. It can take up to 12 weeks to be comfortable walking 30 minutes briskly depending upon the amount of heart damage and your previous fitness level. Once you are comfortable walking briskly for 30 minutes once a day you can begin to incorporate other types of exercise such as biking, hiking, rowing, jogging or tennis. It's unlikely that your physician would recommend you start a strength training program directly out of the hospital. Instead, you should ask your physician about starting a strength training program.  You can use hand weights at home or a set of resistance bands that you stand on or anchor in a doorway. Resistance bands can be used for both arms and legs and will let you gradually increase the amount of resistance and energy you expend. Give your muscles time to recover in between sessions, so don't strength train more than three times a week and wait at least 48 hours in between each session. Strength training will also increase the likelihood you\u2019ll be able to return to your previous level of activities, such as mowing the lawn, playing with the grandchildren and bringing in the groceries. Strength training will reduce the potential that you\u2019ll suffer from more inactivity and muscle wasting. Do not hold your breath while you are lifting weights or moving against the resistance bands. This increases the pressure in your chest and places a greater workload on your heart. Once you've exercised, don't stay in a chair the rest of the day. Research has determined that although you may exercise for up to one hour a day, if you remain in your chair for the next eight hours working or watching television you will lose all the benefits of exercise. Instead, try breaking up your day by getting up and stretching or moving about every 30 minutes. Get up to drink a glass of water, use the bathroom, stretch, or walk around for five minutes. To encourage movement, you can also:  Walk around when you are on the phone talking, or at least stand instead of sitting. Put your glass of water across the room so you must get up every 30 minutes to drink.

With your doctor's permission, you can often start stretching in the hospital. Try to stretch at least once a day to get your body ready for exercise. Remember to relax and breathe through the stretches. Keep your joints slightly bent and never locked during stretching to prevent injuries. You should also avoid bouncing your muscles. Instead, stretch smoothly and hold the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat stretches three to four times. Stretching does not improve muscle strength or heart efficiency, but it does improve your flexibility, allow you to do different types of exercises more easily, improve your balance and will relieve muscle tension. Whether you were a marathon runner before the heart attack or a couch potato, your exercise program after a heart attack starts with a walking program. Do a walking warm up for three minutes. Then work up to a pace at which you are breathing heavier than when you\u2019re sitting, but you can still talk and carry on a conversation. Walk for approximately 5 minutes at this pace. Add about one or two minutes to your daily walk each day until you are walking 30 minutes every day.  Walk with a partner for the first several weeks and stay close to home in case you become uncomfortable or very out of breath. Carry a cell phone with you in case you need help from home or to call 911 in case of an emergency. Remember to cool down after your workout. Avoid strenuous activity during the four to six weeks after your heart attack. It takes your heart approximately six weeks to heal enough for moderate to heavy exercise even if you were in fairly good condition before your heart attack. Avoid things like: heavy lifting or pulling, vacuuming, scrubbing, sweeping, painting, running, mowing or sudden bursts of movement. You can start doing things like walking on a flat surface for a few minutes at a time, cooking, washing dishes, shopping, light gardening and light housework.  Increase your exercise time and intensity gradually without ever crossing over into anaerobic exercise. Expect that your leg and arm muscles may be sore in the hours and days following the start of a program. They shouldn't be sore or feel painful during the exercise. Just as if you were starting an exercise program before a heart attack, you\u2019ll want to increase your time and intensity gradually. This will reduce your potential for injury and keep you motivated. Don\u2019t start increasing the time or intensity until your physician has cleared you to do more than walking for 30 minutes. It can take up to 12 weeks to be comfortable walking 30 minutes briskly depending upon the amount of heart damage and your previous fitness level. Once you are comfortable walking briskly for 30 minutes once a day you can begin to incorporate other types of exercise such as biking, hiking, rowing, jogging or tennis. It's unlikely that your physician would recommend you start a strength training program directly out of the hospital. Instead, you should ask your physician about starting a strength training program.  You can use hand weights at home or a set of resistance bands that you stand on or anchor in a doorway. Resistance bands can be used for both arms and legs and will let you gradually increase the amount of resistance and energy you expend.

You can wash your car by hand using only a bucket, water, soap, and a few clean rags. The shippers will take precautions to keep your car safe, and so you won't need to have the car alarm turned on. Before the shippers pick up your car, either fully shut off the car alarm, or temporarily disable it so that you can easily turn it back on when you pick the car up. Refer to your car manual to find out how to disable the alarm. You may need to work through an electronic menu system particular to your car.

Since you\u2019re not driving the car to its destination, there's no need to have the car shipped with a full tank of gas. Shipping companies often prefer to ship cars with the gas tank close to empty. Gas is heavy, and a full tank of it may over-load the shipping truck. If the gas tank is low, between 1/8th to 1/4th of a tank, it will save quite a bit of weight. For example, secure or remove any loose parts or specialty items from your car such as ground effects, spoilers, or fog lights. These could become damaged or break off while the car ships, and the shipper's insurance may not cover this type of item.  If you have wide side mirrors, fold them back. Be sure to lower and remove/retract the antennae. Also remove any personal items from your car. The shipping company will most likely not insure that personal items left behind will still be inside the car when it's delivered. You may want to go as far as taking (and dating) pictures of the vehicle prior to shipping it. Then, compare these photographs with more photos you'll take after the vehicle arrives at its destination. These photos will show if the car was damaged while being shipped and will be valuable evidence to show the insurance company if you file for damages. Most shipping companies will provide you with a location that you\u2019ll bring your car to on the day it ships. The company will also specify a time at which you should bring your car by the pickup location. Bring your car to the location about 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Or, if your shipping company is picking up your car, have it in the street, ready to go by the pickup time. When dropping off your car, be sure to your car keys with the driver.

You may want to go as far as taking (and dating) pictures of the vehicle prior to shipping it. Then, compare these photographs with more photos you'll take after the vehicle arrives at its destination. These photos will show if the car was damaged while being shipped and will be valuable evidence to show the insurance company if you file for damages. Most shipping companies will provide you with a location that you\u2019ll bring your car to on the day it ships. The company will also specify a time at which you should bring your car by the pickup location. Bring your car to the location about 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Or, if your shipping company is picking up your car, have it in the street, ready to go by the pickup time. When dropping off your car, be sure to your car keys with the driver. Otherwise, they\u2019ll be unable to start your car and it move onto the truck. These 3 documents will verify your identity and prove that the car is registered in your name. If the registration and proof of insurance are not already in your glove box, make sure to put them somewhere in the car before you drop it off for shipment. The driver or a business representative from the shipping company may need to write down your ID number and your insurance policy number. Before the shipping company can transport your vehicle, they\u2019ll need you to fill out and sign some paperwork. If you\u2019re shipping your vehicle internationally, you may need to sign forms dealing with import laws in the country the car is going to. The company may ask you to review and sign documents including:  A shipping invoice. A certificate of origin certifying the country which the shipped items are coming from. Forms listing payments received and any outstanding financial balance. The shipping company will appreciate your thorough descriptions of any difficulties that they may have when trying to start, stop, or drive your vehicle on and off of the trailer. Print this information on a sheet of paper that you\u2019ll leave in the vehicle when it\u2019s shipped. Or, send a shipping company representative an email describing your car\u2019s problems or quirks. For example, let the shipping company know if the engine floods easily, if a certain gear doesn\u2019t work, or if the parking break is too weak to hold the car in position when it\u2019s parked on an incline.\n", "improve": [3]}}

Pick a neutral for the main part of your outfit, then add 1-2 other colors around it.  For instance, try a black suit with a pale pink shirt or a silver dress with a bright blue jacket thrown over it. When pairing neutrals like navy and olive with other colors, think about their hues. For instance, olive complements maroons and oranges, but it also does well with blues and golds because they're nearby on the color wheel. Pick out 2 complementary colors on the color wheel, and use that to build your outfit. If you choose orange and blue, for instance, you might pair a bright orange shirt with a dark pair of blue jeans. Another good way to use complementary colors to good effect is to pair 1 complementary color with a paler tint of its opposite color. For example, mix a purple dress with a pale yellow shawl. Try picking 2-3 colors that are right next to each other on the wheel and guide your outfit with those. These similar hues will make your outfit seem cohesive. For example, you might pair a bright yellow sundress with a pale orange scarf.  Another example of using analogous colors to good effect might be a scarlet red dress with gold jewelry and pink shoes. While you usually should avoid mixing warm and cool colors, you can occasionally break that rule if you find something that looks good together. For instance, with your bright yellow dress, you might find a pale green cardigan that looks smashing with it. A good place to start with a monochrome look is with the primary colors. Pick a single color to start your look, then choose shades and tints of that color to put together your outfit. For instance, try a navy pantsuit with a pale blue shirt and bright blue pumps. When you're creating a monochrome look, try to stay in the same spoke on the color wheel. That is, if you choose blue, make sure you're picking true blues, not purple-y blues. The primary colors red, yellow and, blue often look great with a solid block of color, such as black pants with a yellow top. Try wearing a bright red shirt with grey leggings or royal blue skirt with a flowing white top, for instance. If you want to go bolder, try pairing more than 1 primary color in an outfit, such as blue jeans, a bright red top, and a yellow purse. Usually, you can tell when 2 colors don't look quite right together by holding them up next to one another. However, you may not be able to guess before you see them together.

If it says \u201cdry clean only,\u201d take it to a dry cleaner to ensure that the piece isn\u2019t damaged. If the label only says \u201cdry clean\u201d then it means that dry cleaning is the preferred way to wash velvet, not the only way.  Take the velvet article to a dry cleaner if you have any doubts. This can save a cherished article of velvet clothing from irreparable damage.  Consider washing any velvet with a tag that says \u201cdry clean.\u201d This article may not be a pure velvet and can withstand hand-washing or even the gentle cycle of your machine. For example, crushed velvet and polyester velvets are usually fine to hand- or machine wash. The safest and most effective way to wash velvet is to dry clean it. You can choose to dry clean your velvet at home or take it to a professional dry cleaner.  Consider getting a commercially available home dry cleaning kit if you are worried about the cost of using a professional dry cleaner. Make sure to read the product\u2019s instructions before dry cleaning your velvet at home. Most products have a hotline that you can call if you have any questions. Take your velvet article to a professional dry cleaner. Remember that most dry cleaners have been trained to handle delicate fabrics like velvet. Ask your cleaner any questions you may have and make sure to point out problem spots. If your clothing item is crushed or polyester velvet, you can either throw it in the washing machine or wash it by hand in a sink or tub. Washing the article yourself can save money on dry cleaning and may be just as effective as a professional.  Make sure to read the label before you start. If you have any misgivings about washing the item yourself, err on the side of caution and dry clean it at home or through a professional. Avoid washing the item with hot water, which can shrink it and cause it to lose elasticity. Consider using a detergent for delicate fabrics or specifically for velvet. Set a washing machine to either the \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201chand wash\u201d cycle to ensure that the machine doesn\u2019t damage your clothing. Hand wash your velvet by filling a tub with lukewarm or cold water and a small amount of detergent. Swish your piece of velvet clothing through the sudsy water by using gentle movements of your hand. Do this until the item is clean. Avoid scrubbing or twisting the item, which can stretch or damage the fabric. When you\u2019re doing washing the item, empty the tub and refill it with cool water. Push the garment up and down until you don\u2019t see any more soap or residue. You can also wash a velvet garment by just addressing individual spots or stains. This can protect your entire garment from laundering and may save you money, too.  Mix one teaspoon delicate care laundry detergent with 2 cups cold water in a tub or sink. Dip a clean, soft white cloth into the mixture and wring it out well. Dab\u2014don\u2019t rub-- any stains with the white cloth until all of the stains are gone. Make sure to remoisten the cloth as needed. Once the stain is gone, rinse the white cloth with cold water and wring it out. Then dab the spot to remove soap and any lingering residue. Mix a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and dilute it with water. Gently dab the solution on the spot until it is gone. Be aware that this is a very potent combination that can damage your garment if you do not dilute the mixture or apply it lightly.  Consider using a dry cleaning solvent to spot clean stains. However, be aware that they often contain harsh chemicals that can quickly damage your velvet article if not used properly. If you only need to make your velvet garment fresh again, use a hand held steamer. This can remove wrinkles and make the fabric appear clean and lush again. Follow up steaming with a spritz of fabric freshening spray to make it smell nice.  Hold the steamer about 6 inches from the garment to prevent soaking it. Run the steamer from the outside hems toward the middle of the garment. Consider turning the garment inside out when steaming and spritzing it with fabric freshener. This can have the same effect as directly steaming and spritzing the garment. Try hanging the item in a steamy bathroom if you do not have a hand-held steamer. Putting a velvet garment inside of a steamy, hot shower without exposing it directly to the water stream is as effective as a steamer. No matter what, do not put your velvet clothing into a dryer. This can shrink the garment and ruin the fabric\u2019s luxurious texture.  Hang any item you\u2019ve machine washed and allow it to dry thoroughly. If necessary, use a steamer to move any wrinkles. Push out any excess water from a hand washed garment with gentle pressure. Make sure that you do not twist or wring the item. Then lay out the garment on a flat surface.

Make sure to read the product\u2019s instructions before dry cleaning your velvet at home. Most products have a hotline that you can call if you have any questions. Take your velvet article to a professional dry cleaner. Remember that most dry cleaners have been trained to handle delicate fabrics like velvet. Ask your cleaner any questions you may have and make sure to point out problem spots. If your clothing item is crushed or polyester velvet, you can either throw it in the washing machine or wash it by hand in a sink or tub. Washing the article yourself can save money on dry cleaning and may be just as effective as a professional.  Make sure to read the label before you start. If you have any misgivings about washing the item yourself, err on the side of caution and dry clean it at home or through a professional. Avoid washing the item with hot water, which can shrink it and cause it to lose elasticity. Consider using a detergent for delicate fabrics or specifically for velvet. Set a washing machine to either the \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201chand wash\u201d cycle to ensure that the machine doesn\u2019t damage your clothing. Hand wash your velvet by filling a tub with lukewarm or cold water and a small amount of detergent. Swish your piece of velvet clothing through the sudsy water by using gentle movements of your hand.

Dip a clean, soft white cloth into the mixture and wring it out well. Dab\u2014don\u2019t rub-- any stains with the white cloth until all of the stains are gone. Make sure to remoisten the cloth as needed. Once the stain is gone, rinse the white cloth with cold water and wring it out. Then dab the spot to remove soap and any lingering residue. Mix a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and dilute it with water. Gently dab the solution on the spot until it is gone. Be aware that this is a very potent combination that can damage your garment if you do not dilute the mixture or apply it lightly.  Consider using a dry cleaning solvent to spot clean stains. However, be aware that they often contain harsh chemicals that can quickly damage your velvet article if not used properly. If you only need to make your velvet garment fresh again, use a hand held steamer. This can remove wrinkles and make the fabric appear clean and lush again. Follow up steaming with a spritz of fabric freshening spray to make it smell nice.  Hold the steamer about 6 inches from the garment to prevent soaking it.

Decreasing your total daily calories will help you do that.  Decrease your total daily caloric intake by about 500 calories daily.  This will generally result in about 1 pound of weight loss per week.  Cutting out too many calories may result in slower weight loss and nutrition deficiencies since you're not able to eat the recommended amount of essential nutrients you need daily.  It's helpful to use a food journal or journaling app to help you count how many calories you currently eat daily.  Then subtract 500 calories to find a total to shoot for daily to help you lose weight. Both fruits and vegetables are very low calorie and very high in fiber, vitamins and minerals.  Making half your meals and snacks a fruit or vegetable can easily help you cut down on overall calorie intake.  It's typically recommended to consume about 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.  A serving of fruit is about 1/2 cup chopped or 1 small piece.  A serving of vegetables is 1 cup cooked veggies, or 2 cups of salad. Whole grains (grains that contain the bran, germ and endosperm) contain more fiber and other essential nutrients than refined grains.  When you choose to eat a grain-based food, choose 100% whole grain.  Choose whole grain foods like: 100% whole wheat pasta,  100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole grain oats, quinoa or barley. Refined carbohydrates (foods made with white flour or overly processed) offer very little in the way of nutritional benefits. Fiber also slows the digestive process, making you feel full for a longer period of time and giving your body a longer period of time to absorb nutrients. Lean protein is essential to all diets, but even more important for a weight loss diet. The amount of protein you need depends on a number of factors, including your activity level and weight.  Lean protein has been shown to keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to other nutrients like carbohydrates. Include a 3 \u2013\u00a04 oz serving of protein with 2 of your meals or snacks.  This serving size is similar to the size of an adult palm or a deck of cards.  Foods to try include: low-fat dairy, seafood, lean beef, poultry, eggs, legumes and tofu. Water is essential in keeping your bodily functions running properly. Moreover, hydrated skin is far less likely to sag or appear loose.  Aim to consume least eight 8-oz glasses (about 2 liters) of hydrating fluids daily.  Some people may need up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily.  This will depend on your weight, gender and activity level.  Water also helps control your appetite.  Thirst and dehydration can feel and seem like hunger, which could trigger you to eat when all you really need is a glass of water. Opt for water and unsweetened beverages over sugary drinks like juice, sweetened coffee drinks, and soda. Sweetened drinks are high in empty calories.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.33333333333333337, "sft": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.33333333333333337}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"lose weight\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"calories\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(14, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(200, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1667, "ori_file_path": 1667, "source": "wle_1089"}, "input_content": "No matter where you want to lose weight, you'll need to decrease your overall weight.

Despite their effectiveness, LLMs, often characterized as \u201cblack-box\u201d systems, present a substantial challenge in terms of explainability and transparency. This opacity can lead to unintended consequences, such as the generation of harmful or misleading content (Gehman et al., 2020), and the occurrence of model hallucinations (Weidinger et al., 2021). These issues underscore the urgency for improved explainability, not just for understanding, but for responsible and ethical application. Explainability in LLMs serves two critical functions. For end users, it fosters trust by clarifying the model\u2019s reasoning in a nontechnical manner, enhancing understanding of their capabilities and potential flaws (Zhao et al., 2023). For developers and researchers, it offers insights into unintended biases and areas of improvement, serving as a tool for improving the performance of the model in downstream tasks (Bastings et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b). However, the scale of LLMs poses unique challenges to explainability. Larger models with more parameters and extensive training data are harder to interpret. Traditional explanation methods such as SHAP values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) become less practical for these large-scale models (Zhao et al., 2023). Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of LLMspecific phenomena, including in-context learning (Halawi et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), along with addressing issues such as model hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023) and inherent biases (dev, 2023; An and Rudinger, 2023; Schick et al., 2021), is vital for ongoing refinement in model design. In this survey, we focus on explainability methods for pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs, often termed as base models.

This growth is a testament to technological advancement and the increasing reliance of businesses and organizations on digital platforms for various operations. A central aspect of this digital proliferation is the extensive use of technologies for personal data collection, primarily driven by the objective of enhancing targeted marketing strategies. The ability to collect, analyze, and utilize user data has become a cornerstone of modern commerce, offering businesses invaluable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. However, the increasing collection and utilization of personal data have raised significant privacy concerns. Users\u2019 privacy is at risk as their data becomes valuable in the digital marketplace. This concern has led to the emergence of regulatory bodies and the formulation of data protection legislation aimed at safeguarding user privacy. These             \fDavid Rodriguez et al. legislations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, impose stringent requirements on how organizations should handle personal data. Ensuring compliance with these legislations, however, poses a formidable challenge. The overgrowth of online services, compounded by globalization, makes it impractical, if not impossible, for regulators to manually assess each service\u2019s adherence to privacy laws. This situation is further exacerbated by the dynamic nature of online services, where data processing practices and the privacy policies disclosing them are subject to frequent changes [1]. In response to these challenges, automated-driven methods have been proposed for analyzing privacy policies at scale [2]. This approach holds the potential for research endeavors aimed at understanding and highlighting privacy concerns, and it also offers a practical tool for regulators to conduct mass evaluations of applications and services, thereby promoting a higher level of compliance with privacy regulations. The automated analysis of privacy policies has leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques [2]. Symbolic and statistical state-of-the-art NLP techniques are proposed to address this task, although each has drawbacks. Symbolic approaches rely on pre-defined rules, leading to lower performance when compared to statistical approaches due to the lack of adaptability to differences present in legal texts. Thus, state-of-the-art research has predominantly relied on statistical approaches such as machine learning (ML) techniques, and particularly supervised learning models, to train and evaluate models identifying privacy practice disclosures such as personal data collection or sharing [3]. These models require the use of manually annotated datasets [4, 5, 6], which are often expensive, time-consuming to create, and prone to errors [7]. Furthermore, building and training those models require advanced technical expertise, contributing to a higher barrier to entry. As a result, their practical application is mainly suitable for large-scale projects where the benefits can outweigh these significant costs. On the other hand, modern Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a significant advancement in the NLP domain, being able to understand and generate human-like text, making it particularly well-suited for parsing and analyzing the complex language present in privacy policies without needing annotated datasets. In this context, this paper proposes the application of LLMs for the effective and efficient extraction of privacy practices from privacy policies. In particular, we focus on ChatGPT, which relies on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. Our study identifies the optimal configuration of ChatGPT prompts, parameters, and models, integrating advanced techniques such as few-shot learning. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our proposed ChatGPT configuration with Llama 2 and other state-of-the-art techniques. Our findings reveal that our proposal competes with and even outperforms these traditional methods. Moreover, we discuss its advantages regarding lower upfront costs, reduced processing times, and greater ease of use. Thus, we propose LLM-based solutions and our specific ChatGPT configuration as a viable replacement for traditional NLP techniques in the task of automated privacy policy processing. Our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the application of GenAI in legal and regulatory contexts [8, 9, 10], suggesting a paradigm shift towards more efficient, cost-effective, and accessible tools for privacy policy analysis.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 2671, "ori_file_path": 2671, "source": "arxiv_593"}, "input_content": "The digital era has led to an unprecedented expansion of web and mobile applications and a myriad of online services.

This growth is a testament to technological advancement and the increasing reliance of businesses and organizations on digital platforms for various operations. A central aspect of this digital proliferation is the extensive use of technologies for personal data collection, primarily driven by the objective of enhancing targeted marketing strategies. The ability to collect, analyze, and utilize user data has become a cornerstone of modern commerce, offering businesses invaluable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. However, the increasing collection and utilization of personal data have raised significant privacy concerns. Users\u2019 privacy is at risk as their data becomes valuable in the digital marketplace. This concern has led to the emergence of regulatory bodies and the formulation of data protection legislation aimed at safeguarding user privacy. These             \fDavid Rodriguez et al. legislations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, impose stringent requirements on how organizations should handle personal data. Ensuring compliance with these legislations, however, poses a formidable challenge. The overgrowth of online services, compounded by globalization, makes it impractical, if not impossible, for regulators to manually assess each service\u2019s adherence to privacy laws. This situation is further exacerbated by the dynamic nature of online services, where data processing practices and the privacy policies disclosing them are subject to frequent changes [1]. In response to these challenges, automated-driven methods have been proposed for analyzing privacy policies at scale [2]. This approach holds the potential for research endeavors aimed at understanding and highlighting privacy concerns, and it also offers a practical tool for regulators to conduct mass evaluations of applications and services, thereby promoting a higher level of compliance with privacy regulations. The automated analysis of privacy policies has leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques [2]. Symbolic and statistical state-of-the-art NLP techniques are proposed to address this task, although each has drawbacks.

Incorporating the stair master as a form of cardio can help increase the size of your hips.  Studies have shown that the stair master recruits about 24% of your glutes and hip muscles. Use the stair master 1-2 times a week for at least 30 minutes per session. To make this exercise more challenging and target your hips and butt, lean forward when stepping and do not hold onto the side rails.  This forces your body to use your butt muscles more significantly. Also take large steps - almost as if you were taking two at a time.  This actives a large portion of those muscles. Another cardio machine that can help tone your butt, hips and increase the size of your hips is the elliptical.  It gives you the opportunity to really work those muscles.  The elliptical machine recruits about 36% of your butt and hip muscles.  This is slightly more than the stair master. Use the elliptical for at least 30 minutes.  However, to get a well rounded workout, try doing 15 minutes of the stair master plus 15 minutes on the elliptical. To help target your hip and butt muscles, really focus on pressing down your foot, heel first.  Also ease your hips backwards a bit, so that your butt is popping out a bit.  This position helps specifically target those muscles. Running is a great cardio exercise.  In general, it's a great way to target your butt and hips.  However, using a treadmill allows you to use the incline function making this machine a great way to increase your hip size.  Walking or jogging on the treadmill recruits the highest amount of your hip and butt muscles - almost 50%. Walk or jog on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes.  Again, doing a combination of multiple cardio exercises can help work your butt and hips in different ways giving a better overall workout. To really target those hips, increase the incline on your treadmill.  This places more stress on your glutes and hips and also give your bottom half more definition. Another option is to walk sideways on a treadmill. Set the treadmill on an incline and start at a slow pace. Cross your legs over one another to walk sideways. This will give your hips the tension they need to induce muscle growth. If you want to burn a lot of calories while toning your hips, consider taking a spin class.  It's a great exercise to help strengthen and tone your hips, butt and thighs.  Spin classes recruit many of the muscles around your hip and butt.  The up and down positioning and varying resistances help make this a great exercise to increase your hip size. To help really target those hips, sit farther back on the bike seat and really focus on pushing down hard on those pedals.  You may even want to increase the resistance. If you're in a standing position on your bike, really stick your butt out far behind you.  This position is another one that will require you to stabilize your body with your butt and hip muscles. Your exercise plan should include at least one day of rest per week, to prevent plateaus and give your body time to recover.

Stay calm at all times and remember it is okay to get hit with the ball, so go for every shot! It\u2019s easy to get discouraged by missing shots, so don't sweat it. Keep in mind how important your job is, and that all you can do is give it your best effort Understand that the goalie position is a very tough position. Accept the fact that you are going to get hit, kicked, and maybe even stepped on, but that it is all part of the game. Mentally preparing for the likelihood of physical injury will help you feel prepared for anything the game might throw at you, so you won't waste time thinking about the possibility of getting hurt and can focus on the game. Do not get scared and stand there waiting for your opponent to make a shot. If possible, attack and take control of the ball, this can help to startle them instead! You can scare the opponent by making your body looking bigger by moving up to the opponent. Or you can make a roar while the opponent is coming at you. The opponent will have a less chance of making a shot. But do not get discourage if you do. You will show your weakness and your lack of confidence will affect your game-play even worse, so keep your mind straight Being the goalie means you have the advantage of using your hands and arms. Don't be afraid to give it your all. Dive, lunge, and jump to block the ball if you have to. If your opponent successfully gets the ball around you, run and slide diagonally toward their right-hand side. If they try to kick it to the right, your feet will block it. If they kick it to the left, stretch your hands out to catch it. Try to keep your legs closer to your opponent than your face to avoid injury. Being fearless doesn't mean you purposefully jeopardize your own safety for the sake of the game. Never try to kick the ball past an approaching opponent, this leaves your goal more vulnerable. Always kick it away from them if possible. Make sure you have a teammate who is able to receive the ball before kicking or throwing it back into play. Penalty shots can be one of the most intimidating aspects of goalkeeping, mastering them will make you less fearful of them.

Recently, however, her health has been failing and she is in and out of the hospital every few weeks for one thing or another. She is very weak and needs constant attention and help. My uncle and his family are living with her to help take care of her and give her the attention she needs. As a child, I would spend at least one week of every summer break staying at her house to visit and we both always looked forward to it. So, in early June I decided to do that again, thinking it may be my last chance to do spend that much time with my Grandmother and to also help give my uncle and his family a bit of a break from taking care of her. The day before I was to travel, I was given the news that my Grandmother was again in the hospital with pneumonia and that she wasn't \"like herself.\" I decided to visit anyway. When I got there, it was late, but I made my way into her room and she was asleep so I sat in a chair that was in the corner and slept until morning. In the morning, I said, \"Hey! Grandma!\"But while her eyes were open and she pivoted them towards me, they were distant. She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it. But then, suddenly, she started to regain her faculties and started to be able to talk and think more clearly like how I had remembered her. On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing. She had returned to how I remembered her in mind and spirit and we were able to really have a nice last day together before I had left.

Take some time to work on bettering your communication. This includes practicing your active listening skills.  Show that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding. You can also indicate your interest by paraphrasing. For instance, \u201cI hear you saying that you feel I don\u2019t help out enough around the house.\u201d You need to have an open and honest conversation about your wife\u2019s behavior. During this conversation, try to find common ground. You might find that you are actually both frustrated by the same things. You could say, \u201cI agree that we\u2019re not really working together on household chores. How could we create a more fair division of labor? I\u2019m feeling really put upon lately.\u201d The nagging might be a serious problem for you. But remember, there are lots of things you love about your wife, too. Reconnect with each other by being affectionate.  Take time each day to hug your wife. Be affectionate by rubbing her shoulders while you watch TV. If you are constantly dealing with nagging, you\u2019ve probably asked your wife repeatedly to stop. She might seem to be listening and even agree to your requests. But it\u2019s important to realize that that is not the same as actually being heard. Being heard means that your wife is taking in what you are saying, understanding it, and acting on it.  If your wife continues this behavior, she\u2019s clearly not hearing what you are saying. Make your emotions clear. Try saying, \u201cI have explained to you that I feel hurt, angry, and frustrated. I feel that you are not hearing me, because you continue to nag me, even though it hurts. I need you to understand my point of view.\u201d Sometimes couples hit a rough patch. If your efforts at fixing the problem don\u2019t seem to be working, you might want to consider some outside help. Counseling can be a great way for couples to learn new ways to communicate.  Ask your wife if she is willing to attend counseling with you. That way, you can work on solving the problem together. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, you can go on your own. You can still get help processing your emotions. It is important that you get some kind of resolution. It is not fair for you to have to live with all of these negative emotions. If your wife does not changer her behavior, you need to keep revisiting the issue.  Make it clear that you are not going to let the matter drop. Try saying, \u201cI know we just talked about this last week, but I haven\u2019t seen any positive changes. I need you to realize how hurtful you are being.\u201d If your wife simply won\u2019t stop, you have every right to demand some sort of resolution. If you have tried to communicate and maybe even tried counseling, it might be time to make a firm demand.  Think about whether the nagging is a deal breaker for you. If it\u2019s not, you can keep trying to make your wife hear you. If you just can\u2019t take it anymore, make that clear. Try saying, \u201cI can\u2019t continue to live with this stress.

Our divorce was final in the early months of 2018. This was a very difficult time in my life, as we had been together for about nine years, she was a step mom to my two children, who adored her very much. My daughter, whose in her teens, had a very close relationship with her. I tried for months, to get her to work things out, but nothing that I tried or did, worked. I felt hopeless, utterly broken. I later found out, that the last year of our relationship she was seeing someone, and it further drove me into a downward spiral. But as they say, time heals all things. A few months ago, my ex reached out to me out of the blue. We had spoken before, briefly, but nothing of substance. Her texts through me for a loop, and for a moment, I felt like my prayers had been answered. She told me how she had missed me, my family, and thought about us a lot. After an exchange of texts for a few days, we met up, and it was the first time since our divorce, that I had seen her and it was like I was seeing her for the first time all over again.

I thought things were looking up, I felt great. We went out on a few dates and things felt good. However, she was moving about an hour away, taking a new job and buying a house. I told her again, how I felt about her and she told me she wasn't in the same place. Ultimately, this hurt me quite a bit, and I felt like I was right back to where I was. Why did she text me to begin with? Did she want to know that I'd still be here? Things stopped after that, and we exchanged texts only occasionally, until she moved. I told her good luck with everything and to let me know if she ever needed anything.

Come up with a schedule so you can have adequate time to study for the test. If the material is easier, you may not need as long as you will if the material is more difficult. Allowing yourself adequate time to study will help you do better. One of the best ways to pass a test is to study the information every day. Cramming for the test at the last minute is not a good practice and can lead to failure. Instead, spend 30-60 minutes every day studying the material you went over in class that day.  If you don't want to study every day, spend the week or two before the exam studying every day. This gives you time to revisit concepts you don't quite understand and allows you time to absorb the information. If you don't understand something, studying beforehand gives you enough time to ask the teacher about it in class. Look at previous tests you have taken in the class. What things did the teacher mark wrong? What kind of things is she/he looking for in answers? Figuring this out can help you study better and improve your answers. Also look at the types of questions your teacher asks. Do they focus mostly on broad concepts or specific examples? This can help you study more effectively.  Ask your teacher for sample tests. Some teachers and professors will provide sample tests for students. If you are taking a standardized test, it is extremely important to take sample tests to get an idea of how the test will be structured. Look at previous homework assignments, too. Many times, teachers will use homework questions on the test, or write questions in a similar way. Instead of studying the same way every night, change how you study. Spend one night reading the textbook, one night learning terms and definitions, one night studying with flashcards, and one night taking practice tests. While studying, go through your textbook and your class notes. Look for the most important concepts. This may include things that are brought up again and again, concepts that are explained in detail, or things your teacher told you was important. Listen closely to your teacher when they lecture. They could give hints about what material will show up on the test. Make a note of this in your notes in case you forget. If you are struggling with the material, go to a tutoring session. This might be from your teacher or professor, or maybe the school tutoring services. You may also ask a classmate who understands the material to help you. Though you will be reviewing all of your notes and the chapters, you should also make yourself a review sheet. This sheet includes all the major terms, concepts, and ideas that will be on the test. Think of it like the highlights of the material. Having it on this separate sheet makes it easily reviewable and might help you remember it better. If the teacher gives you a study guide, make sure that you complete it. This is a great way to review the material. Many times, teachers will pull questions directly from the study guide or reword questions from the study guide. Study guides also help you focus your studying so you study the correct material. Gather a few classmates from your class to study together. Quiz each other, come up with possible test questions, and use each other's notes to fill in gaps in your own notes.

The text  classification  task  are  in  relevance  with  several  domains  such  as  intention  classification,  topic  classification,  sen-  timent analysis, etc. (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong,  2019;  Risch  and  Krestel,  2019;  Li  et  al.,  2020;  Heo  et al., 2021). Since the advent of pre-trained language  models (PLMs) such as Bidirectional encoder represen-  tations from transformers (BERT), Transformer-based  deep learning models have exhibited excellent perfor-  mance for text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et  al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen  et al., 2020).  However,  Transforemer-based  deep  learning  models  may yield underfitting because the size of the model can  be too extensive compared to the size of the training data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019).  In  this  regard,  some  studies  have  reported that the performance can be improved in vari-  ous tasks by artificially increasing the size of the data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019;  Brown  et  al.,  2020).  In  data-driven  machine learning, collecting sufficient amount of high-  quality  data  is  definitely  an  important  process  for  an  adequate level of model learning, but since such collec-  tion processes are not always viable, many studies tackle  this  issue  from the perspective of augmentation  using  pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019;  Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie  et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).  Two kinds of strategies are mainly adopted for natural  language data augmentation. The first is to collect data  using human resources, and the other is to create and  modify  data  mechanically  or  semi-automatically.  The  former guarantees data quality, but collecting and pre-  processing large-scale data manually is extremely time-  consuming  and  costly.  Therefore,  various  automation  strategies were proposed to overcome such limitation. In  representative approaches, data is augmented by using  a generation model or modifying a part of the text (Yu  et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al.,  2020).  As one of the studies using generation models, Yu et al.  (2018) proposed a back-translation method using both  direction of machine translation systems. Here, the data is  augmented  by  translating  an  English  sentence  into  French  and  then  translating  it  back  to  English  again  through a French-English translation model. However,  since semantic discrepancy can occur in the round-trip-  translation to other languages, the augmentation of nat-  ural  and  syntactically  plausible  sentences  is  often  not  guaranteed.  In the approach using text modification, data similar to  the original text is augmented by using strategies such  as replacing a specific word with a synonym, inserting  a random  word, changing the position of two random  words in a sentence, or deleting a random word (Wei and  Zou, 2019). Other studies investigated the effect of giv-  ing synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and  hypernym, and using semantic text exchange  (Feng et  al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, using a thesaurus  such as WordNet or a part-of-speech tagger usually re-  quires considerable amount of time and budget.  To attack the above limitations, we propose a data aug-            \fFigure 1: Architecture according to the proposed methods: (a) DAG (b) DAM (c) DAGAM  mentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation  model and character order change (COC) strategy. Our  methodology consists of  three steps (Figure 1). The first  is to augment data using a generation model on raw text,  which we define as data augmentation with generation  (DAG). The second is to augment data  using COC, a  strategy that corrupts some words appearing in raw text,  and  we define this as data  augmentation  with  modifi-  cation  (DAM).  Finally,  we  combine  the  two  methods  and  call  it  as  data  augmentation  with  generation  and  modification (DAGAM).  Our methodology is a simple and easy strategy to auto-  matically augment natural language data. We perform  data  augmentation  on  six  benchmark  datasets  in  text  classification task.

Since the advent of pre-trained language  models (PLMs) such as Bidirectional encoder represen-  tations from transformers (BERT), Transformer-based  deep learning models have exhibited excellent perfor-  mance for text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et  al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen  et al., 2020).  However,  Transforemer-based  deep  learning  models  may yield underfitting because the size of the model can  be too extensive compared to the size of the training data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019).  In  this  regard,  some  studies  have  reported that the performance can be improved in vari-  ous tasks by artificially increasing the size of the data  (Liu  et  al.,  2019;  Brown  et  al.,  2020).  In  data-driven  machine learning, collecting sufficient amount of high-  quality  data  is  definitely  an  important  process  for  an  adequate level of model learning, but since such collec-  tion processes are not always viable, many studies tackle  this  issue  from the perspective of augmentation  using  pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019;  Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie  et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).  Two kinds of strategies are mainly adopted for natural  language data augmentation. The first is to collect data  using human resources, and the other is to create and  modify  data  mechanically  or  semi-automatically.  The  former guarantees data quality, but collecting and pre-  processing large-scale data manually is extremely time-  consuming  and  costly.  Therefore,  various  automation  strategies were proposed to overcome such limitation. In  representative approaches, data is augmented by using  a generation model or modifying a part of the text (Yu  et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al.,  2020).  As one of the studies using generation models, Yu et al.  (2018) proposed a back-translation method using both  direction of machine translation systems. Here, the data is  augmented  by  translating  an  English  sentence  into  French  and  then  translating  it  back  to  English  again  through a French-English translation model. However,  since semantic discrepancy can occur in the round-trip-  translation to other languages, the augmentation of nat-  ural  and  syntactically  plausible  sentences  is  often  not  guaranteed.  In the approach using text modification, data similar to  the original text is augmented by using strategies such  as replacing a specific word with a synonym, inserting  a random  word, changing the position of two random  words in a sentence, or deleting a random word (Wei and  Zou, 2019). Other studies investigated the effect of giv-  ing synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and  hypernym, and using semantic text exchange  (Feng et  al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020).

Implicitly, a human can also infer that this \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d might be a replica1 of the original one in Paris, 1 The small Eiffel Tower in Paris, Arkansas, United States: eiffel-tower-park France. Concretely, the process of geospatially grounded language understanding involves core tasks such as recognizing geospatial concepts being described, inferring the identities of those concepts, and reasoning about their spatially qualified relations. These tasks are essential for applications that involve the use of place names and their spatial relations, such as social media message analysis (Hu et al., 2022), emergency response (Gritta et al., 2018b), natural disaster analysis (Wang et al., 2020), and geographic information retrieval (Wallgr\u00fcn et al., 2018). Pretrained language models (PLMs; Devlin et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2020) have seen broad adaptation across various domains such as biology (Lee et al., 2020), healthcare (Alsentzer et al., 2019), law (Chalkidis et al., 2020; Douka et al., 2021), software engineering (Tabassum et al., 2020), and social media (R\u00f6ttger and Pierrehumbert, 2021; Guo et al., 2021). These models benefit from in-domain corpora (e.g., PubMed for the biomedical domain) to learn domain-specific terms and concepts. Similarly, a geospatially grounded language model requires training with geo-corpora. The geo-corpora should cover worldwide geo-entity names and their variations, geographical locations, and spatial relations to other geo-entities. Although some geo-corpora are available, e.g., LGL (Lieberman et al., 2010) and SpatialML (Mani et al., 2010), the sizes of the datasets are relatively small. In contrast, Wikipedia stores many articles describing places worldwide and can serve as comprehensive geo-corpora for geospatially grounded language understanding. However, training with Wikipedia only solves partial challenges in geospatial grounding, as it only provides the linguistic context of a geo-entity with sentences describing history, demographics, climate, etc. The information about the geospatial neighbors of a geoentity is still missing.

(See \u00a72.3) scale geographical databases (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata) can provide extensive amounts of geo-entity locations and geospatial relations, enriching the information sourced from Wikipedia. Additionally, the geolocations from OpenStreetMap can help connecting the learned geo-entity representations to physical locations on the Earth. To address these challenges, we propose GEOLM, a language model specifically designed to support geospatially grounded natural language understanding. Our model aims to enhance the comprehension of places, types, and spatial relations in natural language. We use Wikipedia, Wikidata, and OSM together to create geospatially grounded training samples using geo-entity names as anchors. GEOLM verbalizes the Wikidata relations into natural language and aligns the linguistic context in Wikipedia and Wikidata with the geospatial context in OSM. Since existing language models do not take geocoordinates as input, GEOLM further incorporates a spatial coordinate embedding module to learn the distance and directional relations between geo-entities. During inference, our model can take either natural language or geographical subregion (i.e., a set of nearby geo-entities) as input and make inferences relying on the aligned linguistic-geospatial information. We employ two training strategies: contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018) between natural language corpus and linearized geographic data, and masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2019) with a concatenation of these two modalities.

For example, \u201cI visited Paris in Arkansas to see the smaller Eiffel Tower\u201d, a human can easily recognize the toponyms \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d, \u201cParis\u201d, \u201cArkansas\u201d, and the spatial relation \u201cin\u201d. Implicitly, a human can also infer that this \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d might be a replica1 of the original one in Paris, 1 The small Eiffel Tower in Paris, Arkansas, United States: eiffel-tower-park France. Concretely, the process of geospatially grounded language understanding involves core tasks such as recognizing geospatial concepts being described, inferring the identities of those concepts, and reasoning about their spatially qualified relations. These tasks are essential for applications that involve the use of place names and their spatial relations, such as social media message analysis (Hu et al., 2022), emergency response (Gritta et al., 2018b), natural disaster analysis (Wang et al., 2020), and geographic information retrieval (Wallgr\u00fcn et al., 2018). Pretrained language models (PLMs; Devlin et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2020) have seen broad adaptation across various domains such as biology (Lee et al., 2020), healthcare (Alsentzer et al., 2019), law (Chalkidis et al., 2020; Douka et al., 2021), software engineering (Tabassum et al., 2020), and social media (R\u00f6ttger and Pierrehumbert, 2021; Guo et al., 2021). These models benefit from in-domain corpora (e.g., PubMed for the biomedical domain) to learn domain-specific terms and concepts. Similarly, a geospatially grounded language model requires training with geo-corpora. The geo-corpora should cover worldwide geo-entity names and their variations, geographical locations, and spatial relations to other geo-entities. Although some geo-corpora are available, e.g., LGL (Lieberman et al., 2010) and SpatialML (Mani et al., 2010), the sizes of the datasets are relatively small. In contrast, Wikipedia stores many articles describing places worldwide and can serve as comprehensive geo-corpora for geospatially grounded language understanding. However, training with Wikipedia only solves partial challenges in geospatial grounding, as it only provides the linguistic context of a geo-entity with sentences describing history, demographics, climate, etc. The information about the geospatial neighbors of a geoentity is still missing. On the other hand, large22 t c O2 ] L C . s c [ v74.12 : v i X r a             \fFigure 1: Outline of GEOLM. Wikipedia and Wikidata form the NL corpora, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) form the pseudo-sentence corpora (Details in \u00a72.2). GEOLM takes the NL and pseudo-sentence corpora as input, then pretrain with MLM and contrastive loss using geo-entities as anchors. (See \u00a72.3) scale geographical databases (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata) can provide extensive amounts of geo-entity locations and geospatial relations, enriching the information sourced from Wikipedia. Additionally, the geolocations from OpenStreetMap can help connecting the learned geo-entity representations to physical locations on the Earth. To address these challenges, we propose GEOLM, a language model specifically designed to support geospatially grounded natural language understanding. Our model aims to enhance the comprehension of places, types, and spatial relations in natural language. We use Wikipedia, Wikidata, and OSM together to create geospatially grounded training samples using geo-entity names as anchors. GEOLM verbalizes the Wikidata relations into natural language and aligns the linguistic context in Wikipedia and Wikidata with the geospatial context in OSM. Since existing language models do not take geocoordinates as input, GEOLM further incorporates a spatial coordinate embedding module to learn the distance and directional relations between geo-entities.

Use a mild soap and warm water to wash your hands before touching the blister site. Wash your hands for 15-20 seconds. This will help prevent the spread of germs, which could cause an infection in the blister area. Don\u2019t scrub the blister; this could tear the skin further. Do not use alcohol, iodine, or hydrogen peroxide, as these can irritate the exposed skin. Let it air dry, if possible, or blot gently with a towel. Don\u2019t rub the blister area with a towel, as this could tear the skin. The skin flap that formed the top of the blister may eventually come off, but will still help protect the raw skin underneath while it heals.  If possible, leave it intact, and smooth it down over the raw skin underneath.  If the blister has torn, or if there is dirt under the skin flap, you may need to trim it away to prevent infection and keep it from ripping further and damaging healthy skin. First, wash the area thoroughly. Then, disinfect a pair of small scissors (nail or first aid scissors work best for this) using rubbing alcohol.

It's important that you address bullying immediately. Children do not always open up about bullying, but there are some signs you can watch for:  Sudden bed-wetting Headaches Stomach aches Sleep issues Skin problems Dizziness Abdominal pain If your child has been dealing with a mean girl, it\u2019s important to help them sort through their emotions. Empathize with your child to help them feel heard. Validate their feelings by saying something like, \u201cWow, it was mean of Sophie to take your phone and text your crush to tell him that you like him. No wonder you\u2019re feeling frustrated and embarrassed. I\u2019d feel that way too.\u201d Show that you care and are willing to listen by asking your child about their challenges with the mean girl. This may make them more comfortable with coming to you when they\u2019re struggling to handle tiffs with mean girls in the future. Asking questions should also help them learn how to fully express what they\u2019re feeling and why they\u2019re feeling it. For example, if your child says \u201cI don\u2019t like Jenny,\u201d then you might ask, \u201cWhy not? What did she do that you didn\u2019t like?\u201d Once your child is in tune with their emotions, start a dialogue about what to do in the situation. Even if your child says they want to hit the mean girl or call her names back, validate their thoughts and suggestions. Then guide them towards a healthier solution.  For example, you might say, \u201cI understand why you\u2019re feeling hurt, and why you want to hurt her back. But what other ways do you think you could respond to her mean behavior?\u201d Don\u2019t just tell your child what to do. Letting them find solutions on their own is much more empowering and will help them feel heard, understood, and supported. If your child is willingly spending time with the mean girl, they may get pressured to be mean to others also. Try to explain to your child the importance of prioritizing kindness over popularity, as doing this may lead to fewer regrets and will also surround them with people that bring them happiness.

Place about 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter into a glass bowl. Place the bowl on top of the oven so the butter will warm and melt over the heat from the oven.  Use a glass or metal bowl for the butter, as this will conduct heat better and allow the butter to melt. Also, a plastic bowl might melt from the heat of the oven. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pot on the stove if your oven top doesn't get hot enough to melt it. Position a large sifter over a large mixing bowl. Measure the sugar, self-rising flour, and baking powder, and pour them into the large sifter. Tap the side of the sifter with your hand to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. This will remove lumps and help incorporate the three ingredients. To make your own self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625 g) of all-purpose flour, 7\u00bd teaspoons (30 g) of baking powder, and 1\u00bc teaspoons (7.5 g) of salt. Add the shortening to the bowl with the dry ingredients. With your fingers, rub the shortening into the flour. Continue mixing the ingredients together in this way until the dough takes on the texture of large crumbs. For a richer and flakier biscuit, you can use lard instead of vegetable shortening. With your hand, make a well in the center of the dough. Pour the cold buttermilk and water into the well. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop as soon as the dough starts to come together. The biscuit dough will be sticky, but resist the urge to keep stirring. Overmixing will develop the gluten and make for dense and chewy biscuits. Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop or flat surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. Flatten the dough into a circle with your hands. Fold the left side of the dough into the center, and then the right side of the dough on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball.  Flatten out the dough with your hands and repeat these same folding steps a second time.  Folding the dough in this way will fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing the dough. Avoid kneading, which can also develop the gluten. Roll the dough out with the rolling pin. Continue rolling until you have a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick circle. Make sure the dough is an even thickness, otherwise your biscuits will be different sizes. Add more flour to the rolling pin and counter to prevent sticking. Use a floured 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch out as many biscuits as possible. When you can't get any more biscuits, collect the dough scraps. Shape them into a ball and roll out the leftover dough. Cut out as many biscuits as you can. Repeat until there's no longer enough dough for more biscuits. Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Position them side by side so they're all just touching. Take your pastry brush and brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter that's been warming on the oven. Brushing the tops with butter will add a bit of a salty kick to the biscuits, and help them become a nice golden brown when they bake. Transfer the biscuits to the oven and bake them for 10 to 15 minutes. The biscuits are ready when they turn a light golden brown color. When they're done, remove them from the oven. Set the baking sheet aside and let the biscuits cool for a few minutes. When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Set them aside until they're cool enough to eat, about 30 minutes. Serve the biscuits plain, buttered, with jam or cream, or with cheese, meat, gravy, or any other topping you like.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.2222222222222222, "sft": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(200, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"self-rising flour\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 9, 13], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"butter\", 3, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"biscuits\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"butter\", 3, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"oven\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(10, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"butter\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1659, "ori_file_path": 1659, "source": "wle_1081"}, "input_content": "Turn your oven on to 450 F (232 C) and let it preheat while you prepare the biscuits.

However, putting yourself out there and being brave is part of the process of finding a boyfriend. Even if it's outside your comfort zone, ask a guy you're interested in out on a date.  It's okay if it takes you a few days to get up the nerve to ask someone out. This is normal, especially if you're new to dating. You can spend a few days talking to friends. If you have a friend who has a boyfriend or a girlfriend, ask this person for advice. You can ask someone out by bringing up mutual interests. For example, maybe you've both talked about a love of horror films. You could ask the guy if he'd be interested in seeing the new horror film coming to your local theater on Friday. You can ask someone out in a fairly casual manner. Try saying something like, \"Would you be interested in getting coffee with me after school some time?\" If you want to make sure the guy knows it's a date, you can add something like, \"Just the two of us.\" If you feel comfortable, you can flat out saying, \"Would you like to go on a coffee date with me this weekend?\" A guy may appreciate this frankness. Once you've met a few potential boyfriends, you can begin going on dates. When going into a date, set out with a positive attitude.  Stay calm going into a date. Do not worry about something going wrong. Instead, go in with the expectation that you're going to have fun. If it helps, you can make a mental list of conversation topics. This may ease your worry about running out of things to talk about, making the date easier. If you're nervous, you may inadvertently engage in behavior that can put off your date. For example, you may rip up a piece of bread from the bread basket instead of eating it. Trying to be positive can help you put out your best self, allowing the date to run smoothly. It can take awhile to find someone you click with. Therefore, make dating a priority. Try to go out on dates regularly. You may have a lot of bad dates, or so-so dates, before you find a guy that's right for you.  Be prepared to meet someone everywhere you go. Dress in a flattering fashion when you go out. Introduce yourself to guys who seem interesting. However, make sure to be safe. If you're outside of school, be careful who you converse with and be sure to travel with friends.  If you get asked out, take a chance. Even if you feel lukewarm with someone, your feelings may change on a date. You should also be brave and ask a guy out if you're interested. He may say \"No,\" but you'll never know if you don't make the effort. Many people want the companionship of a romance in high school. However, keep in mind you should be yourself. Do not give up aspects of your personality in order to win male affection. For example, if you worry a guy won't be interested in a nerdy girl, don't quit the science team. Pursuing your interest in science is more important for your longterm goals and you do not want to date someone who does not like you for you. A lot of attraction comes down to confidence. On a date, wear something that makes you feel attractive. If you feel confident and beautiful going into a date, you're more likely to come off that way. This can help the date go smoothly.

However, putting yourself out there and being brave is part of the process of finding a boyfriend. Even if it's outside your comfort zone, ask a guy you're interested in out on a date.  It's okay if it takes you a few days to get up the nerve to ask someone out. This is normal, especially if you're new to dating. You can spend a few days talking to friends. If you have a friend who has a boyfriend or a girlfriend, ask this person for advice. You can ask someone out by bringing up mutual interests. For example, maybe you've both talked about a love of horror films. You could ask the guy if he'd be interested in seeing the new horror film coming to your local theater on Friday. You can ask someone out in a fairly casual manner. Try saying something like, \"Would you be interested in getting coffee with me after school some time?\" If you want to make sure the guy knows it's a date, you can add something like, \"Just the two of us.\" If you feel comfortable, you can flat out saying, \"Would you like to go on a coffee date with me this weekend?\" A guy may appreciate this frankness. Once you've met a few potential boyfriends, you can begin going on dates. When going into a date, set out with a positive attitude.  Stay calm going into a date. Do not worry about something going wrong. Instead, go in with the expectation that you're going to have fun. If it helps, you can make a mental list of conversation topics. This may ease your worry about running out of things to talk about, making the date easier. If you're nervous, you may inadvertently engage in behavior that can put off your date. For example, you may rip up a piece of bread from the bread basket instead of eating it. Trying to be positive can help you put out your best self, allowing the date to run smoothly. It can take awhile to find someone you click with. Therefore, make dating a priority. Try to go out on dates regularly. You may have a lot of bad dates, or so-so dates, before you find a guy that's right for you.  Be prepared to meet someone everywhere you go. Dress in a flattering fashion when you go out. Introduce yourself to guys who seem interesting. However, make sure to be safe. If you're outside of school, be careful who you converse with and be sure to travel with friends.  If you get asked out, take a chance. Even if you feel lukewarm with someone, your feelings may change on a date. You should also be brave and ask a guy out if you're interested. He may say \"No,\" but you'll never know if you don't make the effort. Many people want the companionship of a romance in high school. However, keep in mind you should be yourself. Do not give up aspects of your personality in order to win male affection. For example, if you worry a guy won't be interested in a nerdy girl, don't quit the science team. Pursuing your interest in science is more important for your longterm goals and you do not want to date someone who does not like you for you. A lot of attraction comes down to confidence. On a date, wear something that makes you feel attractive. If you feel confident and beautiful going into a date, you're more likely to come off that way. This can help the date go smoothly.

Girls are often taught that they don't deserve respect, so you'll stand out from a lot of other guys.  Make sure that you have respect for yourself, too. This is about confidence. When you talk to or approach a girl, don't base your happiness on whether she's going to be interested in you. When you make it seem like you're desperate. Politely engage her in conversation and if she doesn't seem interested, back off. Be respectful to other people when you're around her (this ties in with treating people well). Avoid degrading women, whether it's by telling a rape joke (just don't), calling other guys \"pussies\" or using words like \"that bitch\" to talk about your ex-girlfriend. You'll come across as disrespectful and immature. A lot of guys mix up being confident with being arrogant and awful. They say that women only want horrible guys who treat them poorly. The thing about this type of guy is that he exudes confidence. It tends to be the confidence rather than the crappy behavior that girls are attracted to. Make it seem like you're actually interested in what she has to say. Instead of jumping right in with something about yourself, follow up with another question about what she just said. Girls, like anyone else, like to think that people are interested in their thoughts and opinions.  For example: you might ask her about her job and when she tells you she's working as a barista, ask her how she likes it, what's her favorite part about the job, what's her least favorite part. Obviously make sure that you listen to what she says. Don't just be formulating your next question, or it'll seem like you're interrogating her without caring about the answers. Don\u2019t get too personal too quickly. If you've only just met the girl, don't jump right in asking about her relationship with her family, or whether she has any deep dark secrets (although asking this as a joke might be okay depending on the girl). if the two of you end up dating, there'll be time for that later. You don't have to have a big shit-eating grin when you're hanging out with her, but it's a good idea to make your interactions fun. She'll remember that being around you was fun and kind of charged (flirting is good for that).  Rather than a big open smile, consider having a kind of half-smile. This is often more attractive to girls than full-on grinning. Make her laugh. Tell funny stories. Real ones are the best ones, especially ones where you come off as human. It shows that you can laugh at yourself. For example: you might tell her about the time you tried to scare your dad when he was coming out of the gym locker room, only to scare a completely random person. Be careful with humor, because not everyone has the same type of humor. Make sure that you're gauging your reaction. Is she laughing hard at what you're saying, or only laughing politely. Avoid harmful humor, as well, such as racist or sexist jokes. Flirting can be a bit hit or miss, but it's a great way to create a fun, light atmosphere. It can also get a bit charged and leave her wanting more. Make sure you go by each individual girl's reaction, because every girl is different in what she likes and dislikes.  Tease her gently. Don't be mean about what you say, but gently poke fun at her. For example: tell her that you can out-dance her on the dance. If she is a better dancer, pretend that you are, instead. Eye contact is an extremely important part of flirting. Keep eye contact with the girl that you're interested in, across the bar, while you're in conversation. It'll build a real charge of energy between the two of you.

It is doubly important if you need to write an essay on the book later. You should highlight or underline important passages, and provide a brief note to the side reminding you why it is important (\"symbolism,\" \"character shift,\" \"repeated metaphor,\" etc.). On paper, you should note bigger moments and shifts -- keeping track of character changes, overarching themes, and passages or moments you don't quite understand yet.  Take notes during class discussion, marking important pages and quotes that you may have missed. You can go overboard with notes. You want your notes to be a guideline for your writing when you finish the book. If the whole book is underlined you won't get a lot of useful information. Knowing literary vocabulary is the best way to get your point across when writing or talking about a book. It also helps you understand the novel as you're reading, giving a name to the myriad techniques and moments that you encounter so that you can take better notes.   Theme: The overarching ideas, morals, or thoughts of the novel. Can be as simple as \"good beats evil\" and as complex as \"capitalism is destroying the modern family.\"  Metaphor: Making two dissimilar things seem similar. \"She is a rose\" doesn't literally mean the woman is a flower, it means she is beautiful, delicate, and a little barbed. A \"simile\" is when the metaphor uses the words \"like\" or \"as,\" ie. \"She is like a rose / She is pretty as a rose.\"  Motif: A repeated idea, image, or flavor in a book. If a book frequently uses sailing and ocean metaphors, for example, it could be said to have a \"nautical motif.\"  Allusion: A reference to another work, either directly or indirectly. For example, any character that dies and is raised from the dead (A Tale of Two Cities, Harry Potter,) is frequently considered a \"biblical allusion\" to Jesus Christ.  Symbolism: When an object in the book stands for the idea of something else. Symbolism is everywhere, sometimes unintentionally, because humans think in terms of symbols. For example, in Of Mice and Men, the rabbit farm comes to symbolize Lenny's dreams of financial security and safety. A symbol comes to represent a much larger idea than it initially appears. How exactly is the story told? Is there humor, or is it mostly serious? Are the sentences long and difficult or short and speedy? You need to move past the basics of \"what happened\" and onto \"why it happened.\" Do you think the author was influenced by other writers, artists, or current events? If so, how do they use fiction to really explore those influences? There are no right answers to these questions, but you need to ask them to get the most out of the novel. You cannot only worry about plot when reading, as plot is just one of the many pieces that make up a novel. Some teachers encourage reading summaries before starting the book. This helps you pay more attention to characters, themes, and structure, since you know how the plot ends up. Novels work on two levels. The first level is \"function,\" and it concerns what the novel is trying to say (plot, theme, setting, etc.). The second part, \"form,\" is how it is being said (perspective, structure, metaphor, etc.). While good readers will note each side, excellent readers will note how the two of them come together. How does form reinforce function?  David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest is all about the nature of entertainment, debating (in part) if one must work for entertainment. Accordingly, half the novel is written in footnotes, making the reader work by flipping back and forth, even within sentences and other footnotes. Even less serious books must merge form and function to be successful. Dracula, tells its horrible story as a series of letters and first-hand documents instead of a narrator. This allows Bram Stoker to slowly ratchet up the horror and gives the reader a sense that this really happened somewhere in England. As long as you cite the findings of other authors, one of the best ways to expand your knowledge of a book is to read into the world around it.

A large portion of existing multilingual systems has focused on downstream NLP tasks that critically depend on upstream linguistic features, ranging from basic information such as token and sentence boundaries for raw text to more sophisticated structures such as part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency trees of sentences (called fundamental NLP tasks). As such, building effective multilingual systems/pipelines for fundamental upstream NLP tasks to produce such information has the potentials to transform multilingual downstream systems. There have been several NLP toolkits that concerns multilingualism for fundamental NLP tasks, featuring spaCy1, UDify (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), Flair (Akbik et al., 2019), CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), UDPipe (Straka, 2018), and Stanza (Qi et al., 2020). However, these toolkits have their own limitations. spaCy is designed to focus on speed, thus it needs to sacrifice the performance. UDify and Flair cannot process raw text as they depend on external tokenizers. CoreNLP supports raw text, but it does not offer state-ofthe-art performance. UDPipe and Stanza are the recent toolkits that leverage word embeddings, i.e., word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017), to deliver current state-ofthe-art performance for many languages. However, Stanza and UDPipe\u2019s pipelines for different languages are trained separately and do not share any component, especially the embedding layers that account for most of the model size. This makes their memory usage grow aggressively as pipelines for more languages are simultaneously needed and loaded into the memory (e.g., for language learning apps). Most importantly, none of such toolkits have explored contextualized embeddings from pretrained transformer-based language models that have the potentials to significantly improve the performance of the NLP tasks, as demonstrated in many prior works (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b; Conneau et al., 2020). In this paper, we introduce Trankit, a multilingual Transformer-based NLP Toolkit that over            \fFigure 1: Overall architecture of Trankit. A single multilingual pretrained transformer is shared across three components (pointed by the red arrows) of the pipeline for different languages. comes such limitations. Our toolkit can process raw text for fundamental NLP tasks, supporting 56 languages with 90 pre-trained pipelines on 90 treebanks of the Universal Dependency v2.5 (Zeman et al., 2019). By utilizing the state-of-the-art multilingual pretrained transformer XLM-Roberta (Conneau et al., 2020), Trankit advances state-of-theart performance for sentence segmentation, partof-speech (POS) tagging, morphological feature tagging, and dependency parsing while achieving competitive or better performance for tokenization, multi-word token expansion, and lemmatization over the 90 treebanks. It also obtains competitive or better performance for named entity recognition (NER) on 11 public datasets. Unlike previous work, our token and sentence splitter is wordpiece-based instead of characterbased to better exploit contextual information, which are beneficial in many languages. Considering the following sentence: \u201cJohn Donovan from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah.\u201d As such, Trankit correctly recognizes this as a single sentence while character-based sentence splitters of Stanza and UDPipe are easily fooled by the exclamation mark \u201c!\u201d, treating it as two separate sentences. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully build a wordpiece-based token and sentence splitter that works well for 56 languages. Figure 1 presents the overall architecture of Trankit pipeline that features three novel transformer-based components for: (i) the joint token and sentence splitter, (ii) the joint model for POS tagging, morphological tagging, dependency parsing, and (iii) the named entity recognizer. One potential concern for our use of a large pretrained transformer model (i.e., XML-Roberta) in Trankit involves GPU memory where different transformer-based components in the pipeline for one or multiple languages must be simultaneously loaded into the memory to serve multilingual tasks. This could extensively consume the memory if different versions of the large pre-trained transformer (finetuned for each component) are employed in the pipeline. As such, we introduce a novel plugand-play mechanism with Adapters to address this memory issue. Adapters are small networks injected inside all layers of the pretrained transformer model that have shown their effectiveness as a lightweight alternative for the traditional finetuning of pretrained transformers (Houlsby et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020a,b). In Trankit, a set of adapters (for transfomer layers) and task-specific weights (for final predictions) are created for each transformer-based component for each language while only one single large multilingual pretrained transformer is shared across components and languages. Adapters allow us to learn language-specific features for tasks. During training, the shared pretrained transformer is fixed while only the adapters and task-specific weights are updated.

That thought quickly went out the window as went deeper into the woods into unfamiliar territory that I did not know about. What I thought was the right way back seemed to lead to more confusion with trees galore, and streams surrounding us. \"This does not seem right at all. Where are we?\" I kept saying to myself mentally, and occasionally to the two furry friends I had right next to me. The only difference this time is they were panting and breathing heavy. Their movements were slowed, at this point I was getting nervous.. I did not know how long we were in the woods, wandering around with me trying to use my intuition and internal sense of direction. Starting to become fearful, I received a sign that I never thought was possible. In the trees next to me where \"P\"'s or \"9\"'s made of felt. They were hanging off random tree branches and it seemed so out of place. I immediately thought \"Maybe this is a sign from God and the angels about how to get home?\" I thought to myself that this must mean I have to go back to the 9'oclock direction, aka to the left. Half an hour of walking later (or so it seemed) and with my dogs nearing the end span of their endurance with their movements very slowed and heavy breathing, there was hope! We were nearing familiar territory getting closer to our home! \"Almost there!\" I kept telling my dogs and myself. Ralphie and KC were exhausted! I was fearful, but filled with hope. We cleared through the woods and finally reached our destination -- home sweet home!

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals (Deska et al., 2020). The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997). Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models\u2014specifically, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a)\u2014 in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content. Our findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees. Following our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, i.e., explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GP models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models.

Go out and do things that will enhance your life rather than just waiting for some prince to come.   Be like Princess Zhao of Pingyang. This princess didn\u2019t start life as a princess. She made herself one! She lived in China, a really long time ago and when her father decided he wanted to take control of China she didn\u2019t wait for him, but instead joined in the battle, raising her own army and helping her father. She took control of her own destiny and you should do the same. Though you might not have the title of princess, you still have people to protect. We are all, across the whole world, the same people but many are treated as less and are abused. Fight for their freedom, because that is what a real princess would do! Be like Rani Lakshmibai. Princess Lakshmibai, who was a queen as the wife of a king, was an Indian princess who fought for freedom for her people from the British. She saw her people being abused and treated as less than human and her son, who should have been king, stripped of power and a future. Instead of leaving the battle to the men, she fought for her people and their freedom. You should do the same. Don\u2019t let anyone define you. Do the things that make you and that you enjoy. The world will tell you what are girl things and what are boy things, or they'll tell you that something is only for a certain nationality; those things don't matter. Don't listen to those people. Just be the person that you are. Be like Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana. This princess of Thailand studies fashion and is just a typical girl...who plays sports! She doesn\u2019t let \u201cfemininity\u201d keep her from doing things that are usually considered for boys. Reach for the stars, no matter what people tell you. Want more for your life and pursue those dreams. Don't just take the same job as your parents because that's what they want you to do. Don't just listen when people say you have to take a girl's job. Pursue your dreams to find your happiness. Be like Princess Sikhanyiso Dlamini. This princess of Swaziland, Africa doesn\u2019t let the rules of her culture define her. She fights against many of the outdated restrictions and pursues her dreams and the things she wants for herself. You should do the same. Find causes you believe in and fight however you can. You can volunteer or hold a fundraiser. You can also help by donating toys or clothes that you don't need or use very often. Tell your parents that you want to help people; they will help you find ways to contribute to the world. Be like Princess Diana. Princess Diana was the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry. Though she died very young, she worked very hard during her lifetime to make the world a better place. She worked for causes like fighting the AIDS epidemic and also worked to help people that others didn\u2019t think were worth helping, like drug addicts and homeless people. Sometimes life gets really hard, for you and for others. Times get tough and it makes people really sad. When this happens you should try to inspire hope, even when things seem hopeless. Stay optimistic and always work for the best outcome, even in the toughest of times. Be like Queen Elizabeth. She\u2019s the queen of Britain now, but Elizabeth was just a princess during World War II. At that time, the terror of war was at the forefront of children\u2019s minds all across Britain. Elizabeth brought hope to all of them by speaking on the radio and working for the war effort. We are all humans, so we deserve equal rights and opportunities. If you see people being treated unfairly, speak up, whether it's in your household or half-way across the world. When enough voices speak up, real change can happen and people's lives can be made better. Be like Princess Ameera Al-Taweel. A princess of Saudi Arabia, Ameera is an icon of equal rights for women in her country and across the Middle East. She uses her power to try to improve conditions for other women who have not been given the opportunities that she has. Never be afraid to be smart. If you see boys that don't like your brains, then they're bad guys, not Prince Charmings. Learn about things because learning is fun! You'll get to do so many more interesting things; the smarter you are, the easier it will be for YOU to save the world. Study hard in school and never be afraid to use your brains!

In general, all these models are initially pre-trained on massive data by unsupervised learning. Furthermore, such models regularly necessitate additional training for two primary scenarios: 1) continual pre-training on new data as the pool of available pre-training data continuously expands (Gupta *The corresponding  Figure 1: Insights into neuron sparsity in large language models to accelerate training. Left: standard linear layer. Right: the linear layer after pruning relatively less important neurons. By omitting computations related to some less important neurons, training on the right side proceeds faster compared to the left side, while maintaining similar performance. et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2023). 2) supervised fine-tuing (SFT) on labeled data to enhance the capacity of LLMs to follow human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023; Ansell et al., 2024). In contrast to initial pre-training, the additional training demands relatively less time and computational resources. Regrettably, it remains somewhat challenging to afford, primarily attributable to the substantial parameter count (Zhao et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2023). Fortunately, numerous practitioners (Zhao et al., 2024a) are dedicating efforts to saving such additional training costs. However, they mainly focus on the Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods (Ansell et al., 2024; Lialin et al., 2023), which is not commonly employed in the aforementioned continual pre-training (Cui et al., 2023) scenario. Hence, it is imperative to explore novel acceleration methods suitable for both additional training scenes simultaneously. In this paper, our objective is to leverage the structural sparsity (Li et al., 2023b) inherent in pre-trained LLMs to expedite their additional training scenarios. In detail, researchers (Zhang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2023) have observed that the SlowerFasterInputactivationsParametersOutputactivationsNeuronImportance            \factivated (important) neurons1 exhibit sparsity in each forward iteration. Intuitively, we can speed up by omitting the calculation of inactive (unimportant) neurons. As depicted in Figure 1, suppose a neuron corresponds to a particular column of the weight matrix in a linear layer. In each training iteration, a compact and efficient neuron importance assessment module (right part) would evaluate the activation status of neurons in advance. By discarding those inactive neurons (columns in the weight matrix), training speed is enhanced. Aside from the enhancement in computational speed, disregarding the computation of inactive neurons also poses the following three additional challenges: 1) determining the method of neurons to discard, 2) assessing whether omitting neurons harms the model performance, and 3) evaluating the effectiveness of the approach in real additional training scenarios of LLMs. For the first challenge, we borrowed and extended several famous neuron importance evaluation metrics (Liu et al., 2023; Han et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2023) within the context of transformer pruning, and unimportant neurons are dropped. Extensive experiments (\u00a7 3.1) on TinyLlama-1.1B (Zhang et al., 2024) help us determine (\u00a7 2.2) 1) using maxip (a neuron importance metric) to assess neuron importance, 2) adopting sampling (versus top-k) neuron selection strategy, and 3) introducing a ladder omission rate scheduler. For the latter two, we separately conduct experiments over Llama-2 (7B and 13B) in both standard and sparsity-accelerated manners for both continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning scenarios (\u00a7 3.2). Evaluation results on several benchmarks show that SAT achieves comparable sometimes even better performance compared to normal training. Moreover, it can obtain about 45% throughput improvement for continual pre-training and 38% speedup in elapsed time for supervised fine-tuning (\u00a7 3.3).

Start setting your alarm to go off at least ten minutes earlier than normal. This way you can do a thorough job without feeling rushed (and potentially botching the job!). There are a couple of household ingredients that you can potentially use as a homemade substitute, but only use those as a last resort. For the best results, go with a product that was specifically designed to do the job without damaging your car in any way. Always stock up on some professionally-made de-icer before winter arrives.  De-icer can be found online, at auto parts stores, and the automotive sections at stores like Walmart and Target. Be sure to keep one can of de-icer in your car just in case it ices over somewhere other than home. Give your windshield and other windows a generous spray of your de-icer. Start at the top and then work your way down to the bottom. This way the de-icer will start running down the windows, which means it will cover more ice without you having to waste more product. Definitely use an ice scraper for this, and not some other tool. Again, you want to protect your windows from damage, so use a tool that\u2019s meant for this specific job. Apply plenty of pressure with each stroke, and scrape as far as you can reach in one long, continuous motion. Don\u2019t chip away over one tiny area, because this could scratch the glass underneath. Use the scraper\u2019s brush end (or a separate brush if it doesn\u2019t have one) to clear the loose ice off the window.  If the ice is being stubborn, spray it with more de-icer to loosen it up instead of hacking away at it. If your reach is short, choose a scraper with a nice long handle to extend it further. Once you\u2019ve cleared the driver\u2019s side, you may feel the urge to just leave the passenger-side of your windshield and all the other windows as they are if you\u2019re in a rush. Fight that urge and take the time to remove all the ice. Keep in mind that local laws may require you to do this. Even if they don\u2019t, take the time anyway. Don\u2019t limit your field of vision when driving. Now that all the ice has been cleared from the windshield, make sure the wipers haven\u2019t frozen to them. Spray the wipers with de-icer if necessary so you can raise them. Then spray some de-icer into a cloth and rub it over the wipers\u2019 blades. Set the wipers back down into place. When you start the car, turn them on to make sure they function normally.

Key to this is recognising long and short vowel sounds. In Latin these variations are shown by the diacritic marks above the letters a, e, i, o, and u. Short vowels are indicated like this: \u0103, \u0115, \u012d, \u014f, \u016d. Long vowels are indicated like this: \u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b.  These diacritical marks are not part of the spelling of the word, they just indicate long and short vowels for pronunciation. If you were writing Latin you wouldn\u2019t include these marks. To say \u201clove\u201d in Latin you need to concentrate on pronouncing the long vowels correctly. \u0101: as in the English father, not the [\u00e6] in fat, or [\u0259] in apart. \u0113: as in the English they, but longer. Not the [ei] as \"ey\" in they, or [\u0259] in apart, or [i:] in ecology. \u012b: as in the English sheep. Not as [ai]. \u014d: as in the Italian \u00f3 in amore. \u016b: as in English root. Not as [ju:] you, or French \"u\", German \"\u00fc\". \u201d The infinitive of the Latin verb \u201cto love\u201d is \u201cam\u0101re.\u201d This is the basis upon which you can conjugate the verb to find its other forms. Latin grammar can be quite tricky, with many different conjugations having a big impact on the word. Here are some of the main conjugations for the present tense to get you started:  First person singular: \u201cam\u014d.\u201d Second person singular: \u201cam\u0101s.\u201d Third person singular: \u201camat.\u201d First person plural: \u201cam\u0101mus.\u201d Second person plural: \u201cam\u0101tis.\u201d Third person plural: \u201camant.\u201d There are six tenses in Latin, and three of these (imperfect, perfect and pluperfect) concerns things that happened in the past. You can learn to say the verb \u201clove\u201d in these three past tenses. The imperfect tense describes actions continuing in the past. The perfect tense describes actions completed in the past. The pluperfect is used to describe something that happened before other actions in the past. Here is how you say \u201clove\u201d in the first person singular \u2013 second person singular \u2013 third person singular \u2013 first person plural in these tenses.

The future perfect is used to describe things which will be finished sometime in the future, whereas the future tense is used to describe actions taking place in the future. Here is how you say \u201clove\u201d in the first person singular \u2013 second person singular \u2013 third person singular \u2013 first person plural in these future tenses.

The \u201cvoices\u201d are active and passive.  If you want to study the grammar for Latin verbs in more detail, you will have to spend some time getting on top of all these variations. The variations in verbs is at the heart of what makes Latin the language it is. To get to grips with Latin stylistics you will have to study verbal modifications. \u201d Love is not only a verb of course, it is also a noun. It is a masculine noun, and the nominative singular version is \u201camor\u201d in Latin. As with the verbs, the noun has a number of variations that change depending on the case of the verb, and whether it is singular or plural. Here are the forms for the nominative \u2013 genitive \u2013 dative \u2013 accusative \u2013 ablative \u2013 and vocative:  Singular: \u201camor\u201d \u2013 \u201camoris\u201d \u2013 \u201camori\u201d \u2013 \u201camorem\u201d \u2013 amore\u201d \u2013 \u201camor.\u201d Plural: \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camorum\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores.\u201d\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"love\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"amor\", 2, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"am\u0101re\", 2, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "# Evaluate overall text quality", "text_eval()"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Latin\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"to love\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1773, "ori_file_path": 1773, "source": "wle_1195"}, "input_content": "If you want to say love in Latin you need to get to grips with pronunciation in Latin.

Here are the forms for the nominative \u2013 genitive \u2013 dative \u2013 accusative \u2013 ablative \u2013 and vocative:  Singular: \u201camor\u201d \u2013 \u201camoris\u201d \u2013 \u201camori\u201d \u2013 \u201camorem\u201d \u2013 amore\u201d \u2013 \u201camor.\u201d Plural: \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camorum\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores.\u201d\n", "final_instruction": "Polish this text:\n\n", "content": "If you want to say love in Latin you need to get to grips with pronunciation in Latin. Key to this is recognising long and short vowel sounds. In Latin these variations are shown by the diacritic marks above the letters a, e, i, o, and u. Short vowels are indicated like this: \u0103, \u0115, \u012d, \u014f, \u016d. Long vowels are indicated like this: \u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b.  These diacritical marks are not part of the spelling of the word, they just indicate long and short vowels for pronunciation. If you were writing Latin you wouldn\u2019t include these marks. To say \u201clove\u201d in Latin you need to concentrate on pronouncing the long vowels correctly. \u0101: as in the English father, not the [\u00e6] in fat, or [\u0259] in apart. \u0113: as in the English they, but longer. Not the [ei] as \"ey\" in they, or [\u0259] in apart, or [i:] in ecology. \u012b: as in the English sheep. Not as [ai]. \u014d: as in the Italian \u00f3 in amore. \u016b: as in English root. Not as [ju:] you, or French \"u\", German \"\u00fc\". \u201d The infinitive of the Latin verb \u201cto love\u201d is \u201cam\u0101re.\u201d This is the basis upon which you can conjugate the verb to find its other forms. Latin grammar can be quite tricky, with many different conjugations having a big impact on the word. Here are some of the main conjugations for the present tense to get you started:  First person singular: \u201cam\u014d.\u201d Second person singular: \u201cam\u0101s.\u201d Third person singular: \u201camat.\u201d First person plural: \u201cam\u0101mus.\u201d Second person plural: \u201cam\u0101tis.\u201d Third person plural: \u201camant.\u201d There are six tenses in Latin, and three of these (imperfect, perfect and pluperfect) concerns things that happened in the past. You can learn to say the verb \u201clove\u201d in these three past tenses. The imperfect tense describes actions continuing in the past. The perfect tense describes actions completed in the past. The pluperfect is used to describe something that happened before other actions in the past. Here is how you say \u201clove\u201d in the first person singular \u2013 second person singular \u2013 third person singular \u2013 first person plural in these tenses.  Imperfect: \u201cam\u0101bam\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101b\u0101s\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101bat\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101b\u0101mus.\u201d Perfect: \u201cam\u0101v\u012b\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101vist\u012b\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101vit\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101vimus.\u201d Pluperfect: \u201cam\u0101veram\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101ver\u0101s\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101verat\u201d \u2013 amaveramus.\u201d Latin has two tenses for things happening in the future, the future tense and the future perfect tense. The future perfect is used to describe things which will be finished sometime in the future, whereas the future tense is used to describe actions taking place in the future. Here is how you say \u201clove\u201d in the first person singular \u2013 second person singular \u2013 third person singular \u2013 first person plural in these future tenses.  Future: \u201cam\u0101b\u014d\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101bis\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101bit\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101bimus.\u201d Future Perfect: \u201cam\u0101ver\u014d\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101veris\u201d \u2013 \u201cam\u0101verit\u201d \u2013 \u201camaverimus.\u201d With Latin\u2019s fairly complex system of grammar, there are still a great many other variations and conjugations of the verb \u201cto love.\u201d As well the six tenses, and the three persons (first (I), second (you) and third (he/she/it)), Latin verbs also have four \u201cmoods\u201d and two \u201cvoices.\u201d The \u201cmoods\u201d are indicative, infinitive, subjunctive and imperative. The \u201cvoices\u201d are active and passive.  If you want to study the grammar for Latin verbs in more detail, you will have to spend some time getting on top of all these variations. The variations in verbs is at the heart of what makes Latin the language it is. To get to grips with Latin stylistics you will have to study verbal modifications. \u201d Love is not only a verb of course, it is also a noun. It is a masculine noun, and the nominative singular version is \u201camor\u201d in Latin. As with the verbs, the noun has a number of variations that change depending on the case of the verb, and whether it is singular or plural. Here are the forms for the nominative \u2013 genitive \u2013 dative \u2013 accusative \u2013 ablative \u2013 and vocative:  Singular: \u201camor\u201d \u2013 \u201camoris\u201d \u2013 \u201camori\u201d \u2013 \u201camorem\u201d \u2013 amore\u201d \u2013 \u201camor.\u201d Plural: \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camorum\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores\u201d \u2013 \u201camoribus\u201d \u2013 \u201camores.\u201d\n", "improve": [3]}}

Don\u2019t assume your body has the same skin type as your face either.  Sometimes the skin on your body is drier or more acne prone than the skin on your face, and determining the distinct skin type that your body is currently is important. As with face lotions, you want to look for body lotions that include the best ingredients for moisturizing your skin type.  This is why it\u2019s especially important to first determine your body skin type, since assuming it is the same as your face could mean applying ingredients that could damage the skin or cause breakouts.  Some ingredients that are great for each skin type are:  Normal skin: Look for thicker lotions or moisturizing creams that include ingredients like vitamin C to help manage antioxidant damage and vitamin E to satiate thirsty skin.  Licorice as an ingredient will also help reduce any pigmentation damage. Oily skin: Use lightweight, non-greasy formulas, especially ones that are fast absorbing or contain witch hazel, which is a great natural ingredient for reducing excess oil production and body acne by unclogging pores.  Avoid thick, greasy products or ones that contain alcohol or petrolatum. Dry skin: Look for thick cream-based lotions or healing ointments, especially ones that contain shea butter or coconut oil, two intensely moisturizing ingredients that repair the skin\u2019s moisture barrier.   Avoid products that contain alcohol, which will dry out the skin further. Sensitive skin: Look for products that contain soothing ingredients like Echinacea to sooth the skin and avocado oil, which contains fatty acids and tons of vitamin B to moisturize the skin and regulate cell function.  Avoid products that contain chemicals, dyes, or perfumes. Combination skin:  Look for oil-free formulas containing panthenol, zinc oxide, and lycopene.  Avoid thick creams and water-based gels, which will be too heavy or drying for the combination areas. Taking into consideration the consistency of the lotion and the directions on the product, pump or squeeze a suitable amount of lotion into your hands.  You don\u2019t want to pump lotion for your entire body into your hands all at once; you want to focus on one area of your body at a time.  Rub your hands together to warm up the lotion and then apply it to your body.  Gently press the lotion into your skin with slow sweeping motions, focusing your application on areas that are particularly dry, like the knees and elbows. Before you exit the steamy bathroom or put on clothes, give the lotion about 5 minutes to sink into your skin.  The humidity will keep your pores open, which will allow the lotion to sink in faster and hydrate your skin better.  Putting clothes on or wrapping a towel around yourself too soon will wipe away the lotion you just applied, and you will lose all of the moisturizing benefits.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.2222222222222222, "sft": 0.25, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"ingredients\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(12, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"to\", 8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 5, 7], \"change\")", "word_count_check(150, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"skin\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1496, "ori_file_path": 1496, "source": "wle_918"}, "input_content": "Just like with your face, you want to use a lotion that is designed for your particular skin type.

Use a clear subject line, such as \"Inquiry About Graduate Program\" or \"Questions From Potential Graduate Student.\" You can also include the specific research area you want to work in in the subject line. For instance, you could write \"Inquiry into Graduate Work on Classical Music Theory.\" It is important to be formal when emailing a professor that you want to work with. Since you haven't met yet and you are hoping for a future relationship with this person, this is your chance to make a good first impression. Remember to use complete sentences and proper grammar. Also avoid using slang or informal language.

You can even include the name of a previous professor that you worked with studying this subject, especially if that professor will be writing you a letter of recommendation. In order to get a reply from the professor, you should ask specific questions that you would like answered. This ensures that the professor can easily draft a response letter to you and that your email is just the beginning of correspondence with the professor.  Do not ask questions that you can find the answers to online. This will be viewed as a waste of the professor's time.

That doesn\u2019t mean you have to choose a floor length option, though - a midi dress or skirt, which usually hits at mid-calf, can be a stylish option.  Tea length dresses and skirts, which are usually slightly longer than midi styles but not floor length, are also a good option for winter weddings. If you\u2019re not sure about wearing a midi or tea length dress or skirt, consider wearing a high-low style. They\u2019re usually longer in the back and shorter in the front, so you\u2019ll get some added warmth while not committing to a longer length all the way around. If you want to wear a shorter dress that ends at the knees or above, your legs may be a little cold at the ceremony and reception. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to ditch the dress -- just swap your bare legs or sheer hosiery for a pair of opaque tights that will help keep you a little warmer.  Err on the side of caution by choosing tights in a neutral color such as black or gray. Wearing a color that coordinates with your dress can sometimes like a little too costume-y. Depending on what type of dress or skirt that you\u2019re wearing, you may want to opt for a textured pair of tights. For example, you can complement a simple sheath dress with a pair of tights with a lacy texture. If you\u2019re wearing a dress with a bold pattern or texture, it\u2019s best to wear smooth tights. It may not seem traditional, but pants can actually be an elegant option for a winter wedding. Just opt for a tailored pair that have an elegant look, and pair them with a statement top.  For a winter wedding, pants in a dark color, such as black, are an ideal option. However, you can also go for a sophisticated, stylish look by choosing a pair in winter white or cream. If you\u2019re wearing pants to a winter wedding, wear them with a bold sequin top or elegant satin blouse to ensure that you look dressy enough. In addition to pants, you can wear an elegant tailored jumpsuit to a winter wedding. If you have an ideal dress to wear to a winter wedding but you\u2019re worried that you\u2019ll be cold in its short sleeves, layer a blazer over it. A sophisticated velvet or brocade blazer can keep you warm and add style to your look. If you\u2019re wearing a simple, solid colored dress, consider pairing it with a blazer in floral pattern that features rich jewel tones to give your outfit some more flair. At a winter wedding, you may have to deal with icy sidewalks or snowy parking lots -- which can be difficult to navigate in stiletto heels. Instead of skyscraper pumps, opt for shoes that are easier to walk in, such as velvet wedges or peep toe kitten heels.  Ballet flats that are embellished with rhinestones or covered in satin are also a good option for winter weddings.

For example, the names of English songs and movies are often directly embedded in Chinese responses. A straightforward way to build a bilingual TTS system is by collecting speech data from bilingual speakers. [1] proposed a shared hidden Markov model (HMM)-based bilingual TTS system, using a Mandarin-English corpus recorded by a bilingual speaker. [2] presented a TTS system using a speaker and language factorized deep neural network(DNN) with a corpus of three bilingual speakers. However, mixed-lingual corpora are scarce while a large number of monolingual corpora are easily accessible. Another way is to leverage monolingual speech data from different speakers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. [5] proposes a polyglot synthesis method adapting the shared HMM states to the target speaker, trained on monolingual corpora. [6] proposes to factorize speaker and language based on an HMM-based parametric TTS system. [7] utilizes a combined phonetic space in two languages to build a codeswitched TTS system based on HMM. [8] maps the senones between two monolingual corpora in two languages with a speakerindependent DNN ASR output based on HMM TTS. End-to-end TTS systems also extend to multilingual tasks using monolingual speech[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. [13] used Unicode bytes as a uni\ufb01ed new language representation for multilingual TTS. 125 hours of speech were used and their system can read codeswitching text, despite the problem of speaker inconsistency when cross-language. [14] trained with designed loss terms preserving the speaker\u2019s identity in multiple languages based on the VoiceLoop architecture [17]. The trained speech is recorded by 410 monolingual speakers speech from English, Spanish and German. [15] used an adversarial loss term to disentangle speaker identity from the speech content, which trained with 550 hours of speech from 92 monolingual speakers. Limited by corpus size, [16] proposed tone embedding and tone classi\ufb01er for tone preservation to generate utterances in a proper prosodic accent of the target language. Generally, each speaker speaks only one language, leading to speaker and language characteristics being highly correlated. Using only monolingual corpora for bilingual or multilingual TTS easily leads to heavy accent carry-over in synthesized speech or inconsistent voice between languages. Actually, bilingual corpus helps deal with the problem. [18] trained a TTS system transforming speaker embedding between languages from a bilingual speaker to other monolingual speakers for a high degree of naturalness. In this paper, we expect to utilize scarce bilingual corpora to acquire more standard spoken English from a monolingual speaker, which is highly correlated with phonology learning. For example, in mixed-lingual utterances, the pronunciation of English by a non-native speaker, like Chinese, is strongly in\ufb02uenced by their native language and is most often different from the standard English pronunciation[19]. Mandarin derives pronunciation directly from the spellings of the word with different tones, which have a high grapheme-to-phoneme(g2p) correlation. In contrast, English is an alphabetic and highly non-phonemic language. In Consequence, native phonemic language speakers, whose pronunciation is in\ufb02uenced by the spelling of the word, often pronounce English words differently from standard English speakers[20]. In mixed-lingual utterances, these speakers, despite quali\ufb01ed bilingual speakers, generally replace some English phonemes with the closest phoneme in their native language, resulting in mispronunciation and differences in phonology like articulation change and intonation variation[21]. Given these challenges, building a state-of-the-art bilingual TTS system requires special designs handling the English differences in phonology between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances. In this paper, our contributions include: (1) introducing phonology embedding to capture the English differences between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances; (2) proposing embedding mask to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and phonology embedding for focusing on expression between different phonology of English; (3) designing embedding strength modulator(ESM) to capture the dynamic information of language and phonology, which helps to generate more standard spoken English speech; (4) experiments showing that static and dynamic components in ESM can control different attributes of phonology. Phonology decomposition and control can make a contribution to more standard spoken English expression and better performance in different scenarios.             \fFig. 1.

[2] presented a TTS system using a speaker and language factorized deep neural network(DNN) with a corpus of three bilingual speakers. However, mixed-lingual corpora are scarce while a large number of monolingual corpora are easily accessible. Another way is to leverage monolingual speech data from different speakers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. [5] proposes a polyglot synthesis method adapting the shared HMM states to the target speaker, trained on monolingual corpora. [6] proposes to factorize speaker and language based on an HMM-based parametric TTS system. [7] utilizes a combined phonetic space in two languages to build a codeswitched TTS system based on HMM. [8] maps the senones between two monolingual corpora in two languages with a speakerindependent DNN ASR output based on HMM TTS. End-to-end TTS systems also extend to multilingual tasks using monolingual speech[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. [13] used Unicode bytes as a uni\ufb01ed new language representation for multilingual TTS. 125 hours of speech were used and their system can read codeswitching text, despite the problem of speaker inconsistency when cross-language. [14] trained with designed loss terms preserving the speaker\u2019s identity in multiple languages based on the VoiceLoop architecture [17]. The trained speech is recorded by 410 monolingual speakers speech from English, Spanish and German. [15] used an adversarial loss term to disentangle speaker identity from the speech content, which trained with 550 hours of speech from 92 monolingual speakers. Limited by corpus size, [16] proposed tone embedding and tone classi\ufb01er for tone preservation to generate utterances in a proper prosodic accent of the target language. Generally, each speaker speaks only one language, leading to speaker and language characteristics being highly correlated. Using only monolingual corpora for bilingual or multilingual TTS easily leads to heavy accent carry-over in synthesized speech or inconsistent voice between languages. Actually, bilingual corpus helps deal with the problem. [18] trained a TTS system transforming speaker embedding between languages from a bilingual speaker to other monolingual speakers for a high degree of naturalness. In this paper, we expect to utilize scarce bilingual corpora to acquire more standard spoken English from a monolingual speaker, which is highly correlated with phonology learning. For example, in mixed-lingual utterances, the pronunciation of English by a non-native speaker, like Chinese, is strongly in\ufb02uenced by their native language and is most often different from the standard English pronunciation[19]. Mandarin derives pronunciation directly from the spellings of the word with different tones, which have a high grapheme-to-phoneme(g2p) correlation. In contrast, English is an alphabetic and highly non-phonemic language. In Consequence, native phonemic language speakers, whose pronunciation is in\ufb02uenced by the spelling of the word, often pronounce English words differently from standard English speakers[20]. In mixed-lingual utterances, these speakers, despite quali\ufb01ed bilingual speakers, generally replace some English phonemes with the closest phoneme in their native language, resulting in mispronunciation and differences in phonology like articulation change and intonation variation[21]. Given these challenges, building a state-of-the-art bilingual TTS system requires special designs handling the English differences in phonology between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances. In this paper, our contributions include: (1) introducing phonology embedding to capture the English differences between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances; (2) proposing embedding mask to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and phonology embedding for focusing on expression between different phonology of English; (3) designing embedding strength modulator(ESM) to capture the dynamic information of language and phonology, which helps to generate more standard spoken English speech; (4) experiments showing that static and dynamic components in ESM can control different attributes of phonology. Phonology decomposition and control can make a contribution to more standard spoken English expression and better performance in different scenarios.             \fFig. 1.

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We compare various multilingual prompting strategies in NLP tasks, finding that translation remains a strong baseline even for LLMs. Our study also identifies factors that affect performance in multilingual tasks. \u2022 We broaden our multilingual evaluation to encompass actual user queries and LLMs that are not primarily centered on English, thereby addressing the limitations of previous works. \u2022 Our study reveals the shortcomings of current multilingual evaluations, underscoring the need for more comprehensive assessments that broaden the range of benchmarks and diversify the types of LLMs considered.", "improve": [3]}}

When our son, Jackson, started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately.  He had difficulty sitting still during circle time and couldn't keep his hands and feet to himself.

This pattern of behavior followed him to elementary school where the classes were larger and the interruptions and misbehavior had bigger implications.  My husband and I had always recognized that Jackson had difficulties keeping himself occupied at home.  We eventually stopped attending church because his disruptiveness during the service was embarrassing. He'd crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and would often yawn loudly during sermons.

This burgeoning search paradigm casts the information-seeking process into multi-turn dialogues with conversational agents. The latter are designed to facilitate exploring and gradually narrowing down the search scope to relevant information items (Aliannejadi et al., 2021; Schneider et al., 2023). A fundamental aspect of these agents is their ability to access data stored in knowledge bases with an inherent semantic structure, such as relational databases or knowledge graphs. Hence, a key challenge lies in bridging the gap between natural language utterances, where users express their information needs, and corresponding formal representations, such as logical forms or executable queries. In the \ufb01eld of natural language processing (NLP), the task of semantic parsing focuses on this problem by deriving machine-readable meaning representations given linguistic inputs. Convera b c d sational question answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs is a specialized facet of conversational search that revolves around responding to user queries in a dialogue given an underlying knowledge graph. Through semantic parsing mechanisms, dialogue utterances are transformed into executable queries to retrieve answer triples from a graph. Semantic parsing regarding question answering has been extensively studied over numerous years, with approaches ranging from rule-based to supervised neural networkbased techniques. With the advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), the \ufb01eld of NLP has witnessed a shift in methodologies. Unlike conventional supervised learning approaches that rely on annotated datasets, LLMs are trained in a self-supervised manner, predicting tokens within vast amounts of unlabeled data. Combined with scaling up model size and training corpora, this approach has demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities of LLMs and their prowess in multi-task learning (Radford et al., 2019). Given a carefully de\ufb01ned input prompt, LLMs have the advantage of prompt-based learning, or in-context learning, which allows them to perform a range of generative tasks like, for instance, question answering, machine translation, or semantic parsing (Liu et al.,             \f2023). Owing to their contextual language understanding and versatile language generation capabilities, LLMs have experienced rapid adoption in applications related to conversational search, such as personal voice assistants, web browsers, or enterprise chatbots. There has been a growing interest in optimizing LLMs for conversational interactions using instruction \ufb01ne-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (OpenAI, 2022). Although LLMs offer tremendous potential, it is crucial to acknowledge their inherent limitations, such as the risk of hallucinating or omitting information and a lack of accountability in high-risk scenarios, with limited transparency of the information sources from which they derive their outputs (Ji et al., 2023). Therefore, it becomes imperative to ground their generated outputs in veri\ufb01able facts contained in knowledge bases, which can be facilitated through semantic parsing. The goal of our study lies in investigating how LLMs perform in semantic parsing of dialogues for CQA over knowledge graphs. To answer the stated question, we systematically compare generated outputs from LLMs of varying sizes and training objectives, with a primary focus on models optimized for conversational interaction. Based on an extensive benchmark dataset, we evaluate the models\u2019 performance in the generation of SPARQL queries from dialogues about knowledge graph facts and discuss insights about their individual capabilities as well as limitations. Our contributions include a benchmark study evaluating four LLMs, utilizing both automatic metrics and human evaluation to identify eight common error types in generated graph queries, and a detailed discussion of prompting and \ufb01ne-tuning strategies aimed at improving model performance.

A fundamental aspect of these agents is their ability to access data stored in knowledge bases with an inherent semantic structure, such as relational databases or knowledge graphs. Hence, a key challenge lies in bridging the gap between natural language utterances, where users express their information needs, and corresponding formal representations, such as logical forms or executable queries. In the \ufb01eld of natural language processing (NLP), the task of semantic parsing focuses on this problem by deriving machine-readable meaning representations given linguistic inputs. Convera b c d sational question answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs is a specialized facet of conversational search that revolves around responding to user queries in a dialogue given an underlying knowledge graph. Through semantic parsing mechanisms, dialogue utterances are transformed into executable queries to retrieve answer triples from a graph. Semantic parsing regarding question answering has been extensively studied over numerous years, with approaches ranging from rule-based to supervised neural networkbased techniques. With the advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), the \ufb01eld of NLP has witnessed a shift in methodologies. Unlike conventional supervised learning approaches that rely on annotated datasets, LLMs are trained in a self-supervised manner, predicting tokens within vast amounts of unlabeled data. Combined with scaling up model size and training corpora, this approach has demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities of LLMs and their prowess in multi-task learning (Radford et al., 2019). Given a carefully de\ufb01ned input prompt, LLMs have the advantage of prompt-based learning, or in-context learning, which allows them to perform a range of generative tasks like, for instance, question answering, machine translation, or semantic parsing (Liu et al.,             \f2023). Owing to their contextual language understanding and versatile language generation capabilities, LLMs have experienced rapid adoption in applications related to conversational search, such as personal voice assistants, web browsers, or enterprise chatbots. There has been a growing interest in optimizing LLMs for conversational interactions using instruction \ufb01ne-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (OpenAI, 2022). Although LLMs offer tremendous potential, it is crucial to acknowledge their inherent limitations, such as the risk of hallucinating or omitting information and a lack of accountability in high-risk scenarios, with limited transparency of the information sources from which they derive their outputs (Ji et al., 2023). Therefore, it becomes imperative to ground their generated outputs in veri\ufb01able facts contained in knowledge bases, which can be facilitated through semantic parsing. The goal of our study lies in investigating how LLMs perform in semantic parsing of dialogues for CQA over knowledge graphs. To answer the stated question, we systematically compare generated outputs from LLMs of varying sizes and training objectives, with a primary focus on models optimized for conversational interaction. Based on an extensive benchmark dataset, we evaluate the models\u2019 performance in the generation of SPARQL queries from dialogues about knowledge graph facts and discuss insights about their individual capabilities as well as limitations. Our contributions include a benchmark study evaluating four LLMs, utilizing both automatic metrics and human evaluation to identify eight common error types in generated graph queries, and a detailed discussion of prompting and \ufb01ne-tuning strategies aimed at improving model performance. To ensure full reproducibility of our experiments, we have established a GitHub repository encompassing all model scripts, datasets, and evaluation outputs.1", "improve": [3]}}

Cloth measuring tapes are soft and flexible tools you can find in sewing kits and craft stores. Most measuring tapes go up to 5 five or so. Most big box stores and drug stores will also carry sewing kits.  You can also print a tape measure off the internet. You can find these with a simple search online. You simply cut them apart, align the edges, and then glue or tape them together. Of course, you need to be careful with this type of tape measure, as it can rip easily. However, don't try to use card stock, as that can be too stiff to get a good measurement. Don't use metal measuring tapes. Metal measuring tapes, the kind you use for do-it-yourself improvement projects, are not good for taking measurements of your body. They aren't flexible enough, so they won't give you an accurate measurement. Wrap it around your backside, being careful to make sure it doesn't twist. Pull the tape around to the other end from the other hip. Make sure you are getting it around your rear end at the same time. You can also start out holding both ends and step over the tape so it's on your backside. This movement can help if you have trouble wrapping it around the back. Now that you've got it wrapped around, check to make sure you've got it right in the mirror. The tape should be parallel to the floor all around, and it shouldn't be twisted at all. Make sure it looks even. You'll need to shift around to check out the back side of the tape. Turn to the side so you can see. When measuring, the tape should be snug around your hips. However, it shouldn't be cutting off circulation. It should be tight enough that you can only fit a finger underneath it, no more. You can look down to find out your measurement. You measurement is where the end of the tape meets a number as the tape measure comes around. You may need to look in the mirror to read the number more easily. Now that you've figured out what your hip measurement is, write it down so you can save it for later. You'll also need other measurements to make clothing, such as your bust, hip, thighs, waist, and inseam, depending on what you're making.  Like your hips, you measure your thigh at the thickest part of your leg. The inseam is the inside of your leg from your crotch to where you want your pants to fall. If you have a pair of pants that are the length, you can measure the inseam on them instead of your body. When you make clothing, you don't make it to your exact measurements because then it would be skin-tight, which would mean it would be difficult to move. Therefore, you must add a few inches to make it more wearable.  You add inches for two reasons. One, as already stated, is to make the clothing more wearable. However, you might also add inches to create a design. For instance, if you want a really flowing, poofy skirt, you might add more inches at the hip than for an a-line skirt. How much the cloth gives also affects how many inches you add. That is, if it is especially stretchy, you probably don't need to add as many inches. Most patterns will help you determine how many inches to add. However, if you are doing it yourself, you should add 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10\u00a0cm), depending on how tight or loose you want your clothing. Also, if you're a bit curvier, you may want to add more inches to allow for better movement.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo": 0.25, "simpo_iter2": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"do-it-yourself improvement projects\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"skin-tight\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"you\", 8, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"do-it-yourself improvement projects\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"measurement\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"tape\", 5, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"hip\", 2, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1794, "ori_file_path": 1794, "source": "wle_1216"}, "input_content": "Hold one end on one hip.

The text representations learned by LLMs transform text into a high-dimensional semantic space (Mikolov et al., 2013). In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals, e.g., EEG, fMRI signals, have been widely acknowledged to be able to represent a snapshot of cognitive representations of language in human brains (Xu et al., 2016). Such signals record human brain activities during the cognitive processing of language and play a key role in revealing the internal workings of human language cognition (Friederici, 2011).

Answering these questions might facilitate us to interpret LLMs from the perspective of cognitive science. Previous studies have explored the assessment of consistency between representations learned by pre-trained language models and cognitive processing signals (Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Hollenstein et al., 2019a; Abnar et al., 2019). Along this research line, recent studies compare human neuroimaging data with representations learned 43 pre-trained language models that are smaller than 1B-sized LLMs, revealing that language models with stronger predictive abilities for the next word exhibit greater alignment with the human brain (Schrimpf et al., 2021). However, current LLMs have scaled up their model size by hundreds of times (e.g. LLaMa3-400B+ (Meta, 2024)), and been strengthened by alignment training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). These factors contribute significantly to the enhanced capabilities of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023b). Nevertheless, it is yet to be tested whether the latest LLMs with scales of 7B and above maintain consistency with human cognitive data. Additionally, the impact of pre-training data size, alignment training, prompts, and other training strategies on LLM-brain similarity has not been investigated. This paper aims to assess the extent to which LLMs mirror cognitive language processing activity and subsequently analyze the impacts of different factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training) on such LLM-brain alignment. Specifically, we adopt functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals as human cognitive language processing signals, and RSA (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), widely used in neuroscience (Connolly et al., 2012; Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017), to compute similarity scores between LLM representations and human cognitive language processing signals. The framework for LLM-brain similarity computation is illustrated in Figure 1. Our experiments comprise 23 open-source LLMs, trained with various pre-training data size, scaling and training strategies (i.e., pre-training, SFT, RLHF), to investigate the impact of these factors on LLM-brain similarity. We further analyze the impact of prompts on the human intention understanding abilities of LLMs and the consistency between LLM sentiment and human sentiment.

Answering these questions might facilitate us to interpret LLMs from the perspective of cognitive science. Previous studies have explored the assessment of consistency between representations learned by pre-trained language models and cognitive processing signals (Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Hollenstein et al., 2019a; Abnar et al., 2019). Along this research line, recent studies compare human neuroimaging data with representations learned 43 pre-trained language models that are smaller than 1B-sized LLMs, revealing that language models with stronger predictive abilities for the next word exhibit greater alignment with the human brain (Schrimpf et al., 2021). However, current LLMs have scaled up their model size by hundreds of times (e.g. LLaMa3-400B+ (Meta, 2024)), and been strengthened by alignment training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). These factors contribute significantly to the enhanced capabilities of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023b). Nevertheless, it is yet to be tested whether the latest LLMs with scales of 7B and above maintain consistency with human cognitive data. Additionally, the impact of pre-training data size, alignment training, prompts, and other training strategies on LLM-brain similarity has not been investigated. This paper aims to assess the extent to which LLMs mirror cognitive language processing activity and subsequently analyze the impacts of different factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training) on such LLM-brain alignment. Specifically, we adopt functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals as human cognitive language processing signals, and RSA (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), widely used in neuroscience (Connolly et al., 2012; Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017), to compute similarity scores between LLM representations and human cognitive language processing signals. The framework for LLM-brain similarity computation is illustrated in Figure 1. Our experiments comprise 23 open-source LLMs, trained with various pre-training data size, scaling and training strategies (i.e., pre-training, SFT, RLHF), to investigate the impact of these factors on LLM-brain similarity. We further analyze the impact of prompts on the human intention understanding abilities of LLMs and the consistency between LLM sentiment and human sentiment. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between the capability of LLM evaluations and LLM-brain similarity. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. \u2022 We employ human cognitive language processing signals to assess the resemblance between LLMs and human cognition. By analyzing the similarity of 23 LLMs to human cognitive language processing, we investigate the impact of various factors, such as pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training and prompts, on the LLM-brain similarity. \u2022 We find that the explicit-prompts result in a higher LLM-brain similarity compared to noprompts, indicating that explicit prompts can enhance the alignment of LLMs with human intentions.

Many of such algorithms learn black-box mappings between input and output. If the overall performance is satisfactory, these learned mappings are assumed to be correct and are used in real-life applications. It is hard to quantify how con\ufb01dent a certain mapping is with respect to different inputs. These de\ufb01ciencies cause many AI safety and social bias issues with the most notable example being failures of auto-piloting systems. We need systems that can not only learn accurate mappings, but also quantify con\ufb01dence levels or uncertainties of their predictions. With uncertainty information available, many issues mentioned above can be effectively handled. There are many situations where uncertainties arise when applying machine learning models. First, we are uncertain about whether the structure choice and model parameters can best describe the data distribution. This is referred to as model uncertainty, also known as epistemic uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) (Buntine and Weigend 1991; Denker and Lecun 1991; MacKay 1992; 1995; Neal 2012) is one approach to quantify uncertainty associated with model parameters. BNNs represent all model weights as probability distributions over possible values instead of \ufb01xed scalars. In this setting, learned mapping of a BNN model must be robust under different samples of weights. We can easily quantify model uncertainties with BNNs by, for example, sampling weights and forward inputs through the network multiple times. Quantifying model uncertainty using a BNN learns potentially better representations and predictions due to the ensemble natural of BNNs. It is also showed in (Blundell et al. 2015) that it is bene\ufb01cial for exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) problems such as contextual bandits. Another situation where uncertainty arises is when collected data is noisy. This is often the case when we rely on observations and measurements to obtain the data. Even when the observations and measurements are precise, noises might exist within the data generation process. Such uncertainties are referred to as data uncertainties in this paper and is also called aleatoric uncertainty (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen 2009). Depending on whether the uncertainty is input independent, data uncertainty is further divided into homoscedastic uncertainty and heteroscedastic uncertainty. Homoscedastic uncertainty is the same across the input space which can be caused by systematic observation noise. Heteroscedastic uncertainty, on the contrary, is dependent on the input. For example, when predicting the sentiment of a Yelp review, single-word review \u201cgood\u201d is possible to have 3, 4 or 5-star ratings while a lengthened review with strong positive emotion phrases is de\ufb01nitely a 5-star rating. In the rest of the paper, we also refer to heteroscedastic uncertainty as input-dependent data uncertainty. Recently, there are increasing number of studies investigating the effects of quantifying uncertainties in different applications (Kendall, Badrinarayanan, and Cipolla 2015; Gal and Ghahramani 2016b; Kendall and Gal 2017; Zhu and Laptev 2017). In this paper, we focus on exploring the bene\ufb01ts of quantifying both model and data uncertainties in the context of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Speci\ufb01cally, we study the effects of quantifying model uncertainty and input-dependent data uncertainty in sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that there is a potential performance increase when including both uncertainties in the model. We also analyze the characteristics of the quanti\ufb01ed uncertainties.

Recently, there are increasing number of studies investigating the effects of quantifying uncertainties in different applications (Kendall, Badrinarayanan, and Cipolla 2015; Gal and Ghahramani 2016b; Kendall and Gal 2017; Zhu and Laptev 2017). In this paper, we focus on exploring the bene\ufb01ts of quantifying both model and data uncertainties in the context of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Speci\ufb01cally, we study the effects of quantifying model uncertainty and input-dependent data uncertainty in sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that there is a potential performance increase when including both uncertainties in the model. We also analyze the characteristics of the quanti\ufb01ed uncertainties.

For example, LLMs have shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks (Dong et al., 2023). Although LLMs have been widely adopted, a prominent issue is that they produce hallucinations in certain situations (Ye et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023). In other words, 1We will release the code upon publication. they generate information that sounds plausible but is nonfactual, thereby limiting their applicability in the real world. To mitigate hallucinations, researchers have resorted to grounding statements in responses generated by LLMs to supported evidence, either by providing rationales or by adding citations to the statements (Li et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). Recent works have utilized external knowledge sources such as retrieved documents and knowledge graphs for attribution (Shuster et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023c). Generally, these works are divided into two types: 1) the model generates an answer with citations based on the retrieved documents (Li et al., 2023b); 2) an answer is first generated, then modified again to add attribution references by retrieving with query and initial answer (Gao et al., 2023a). However, these works focus mainly on the retrieval stage (Ye et al., 2023b) and the evaluation process (Yue et al., 2023). Considering the selection of the model\u2019s desired responses and behavior from its very broad knowledge and capabilities, it is more necessary to optimize the generation process, not only reducing the hallucination of the original answer but also avoiding the hallucination of the attribution process. On the other hand, fine-tuning LLMs after pre-training can also significantly improve performance for users\u2019 downstream tasks. First, given positive examples of correct behavior, supervised fine-tuning can be performed using standard likelihood-based training. Secondly, given positive and negative examples (binary feedback or pairwise feedback), methods such as unlikelihood training on negative examples (Welleck et al., 2020) or RLHF-PPO (Ziegler et al., 2019) can be used for learning. However, these methods usually suffer from expensive data collection process, reward model training, sparse reward and text degeneration problems, making them difficult to use in practical applications (Azar et al., 2023). In this paper, inspired by the citation mecha            \fnisms in human scholarly writing (Brooks, 1986; Teplitskiy et al., 2022), we address these challenges by conceptualizing the attribution task for LLMs as preference learning and proposing an Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework, as shown in Figure 1. Initially, we assemble a curated dataset comprising 6,330 examples sourced and refined from existing datasets for posttraining. This step makes the LLMs know the basic format and requirements of attribution. Considering the substantial cost and extremely timeconsuming of preference pair annotations, we thus introduce an automated approach to generate attribution preference data, yielding 95,263 pairs. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human process of citation and direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023), we propose a progressive preference optimization method with experience replay bypassing the need for explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. We conduct the extensive experiment on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5). The experiment results demonstrate that APO surpasses compared baselines across all datasets with improved citation F1 along with higher response quality. Our contributions are summarized as follows: \u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply preference learning for attribution tasks.

For example, LLMs have shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks (Dong et al., 2023). Although LLMs have been widely adopted, a prominent issue is that they produce hallucinations in certain situations (Ye et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023). In other words, 1We will release the code upon publication. they generate information that sounds plausible but is nonfactual, thereby limiting their applicability in the real world. To mitigate hallucinations, researchers have resorted to grounding statements in responses generated by LLMs to supported evidence, either by providing rationales or by adding citations to the statements (Li et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). Recent works have utilized external knowledge sources such as retrieved documents and knowledge graphs for attribution (Shuster et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023c). Generally, these works are divided into two types: 1) the model generates an answer with citations based on the retrieved documents (Li et al., 2023b); 2) an answer is first generated, then modified again to add attribution references by retrieving with query and initial answer (Gao et al., 2023a). However, these works focus mainly on the retrieval stage (Ye et al., 2023b) and the evaluation process (Yue et al., 2023). Considering the selection of the model\u2019s desired responses and behavior from its very broad knowledge and capabilities, it is more necessary to optimize the generation process, not only reducing the hallucination of the original answer but also avoiding the hallucination of the attribution process. On the other hand, fine-tuning LLMs after pre-training can also significantly improve performance for users\u2019 downstream tasks. First, given positive examples of correct behavior, supervised fine-tuning can be performed using standard likelihood-based training. Secondly, given positive and negative examples (binary feedback or pairwise feedback), methods such as unlikelihood training on negative examples (Welleck et al., 2020) or RLHF-PPO (Ziegler et al., 2019) can be used for learning. However, these methods usually suffer from expensive data collection process, reward model training, sparse reward and text degeneration problems, making them difficult to use in practical applications (Azar et al., 2023). In this paper, inspired by the citation mecha            \fnisms in human scholarly writing (Brooks, 1986; Teplitskiy et al., 2022), we address these challenges by conceptualizing the attribution task for LLMs as preference learning and proposing an Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework, as shown in Figure 1. Initially, we assemble a curated dataset comprising 6,330 examples sourced and refined from existing datasets for posttraining. This step makes the LLMs know the basic format and requirements of attribution. Considering the substantial cost and extremely timeconsuming of preference pair annotations, we thus introduce an automated approach to generate attribution preference data, yielding 95,263 pairs. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human process of citation and direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023), we propose a progressive preference optimization method with experience replay bypassing the need for explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. We conduct the extensive experiment on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5). The experiment results demonstrate that APO surpasses compared baselines across all datasets with improved citation F1 along with higher response quality.

This detox can take anywhere from 5-14 days, and is most suitable for people with very severe alcoholism and withdrawal symptoms, such as delirium tremens. You can recover in a calming facility, letting you escape from the pressures of day-to-day life.  Some people can detox well in a facility, but have trouble when they return home. Having the support of family and friends can make this transition a little easier. Inpatient detox can also be quite expensive. Ask your insurance if they offer coverage, or inquire at the center to see if there\u2019s a payment plan that allows you to pay the fee over a few months. You must see a doctor before heading to an inpatient detox facility. They will be able to determine whether it\u2019s the right course of action for your recovery. Outpatient detox treatment will require you to spend some time at a detox clinic everyday for anywhere from several days to 2 weeks. You won\u2019t have to stay overnight at the facility, but your medications and recovery progress will be closely supervised by the professionals there. Outpatient detox offers the benefit of being able to live at home and have more freedom, as well as being less expensive than inpatient detox.  However, outpatient detox also makes it easier to relapse and start drinking again. This is particularly hard if you have a difficult home life, or if another family member is an alcoholic.  Outpatient detox is only suitable for those with mild to moderate symptoms of alcoholism, who haven\u2019t been drinking heavily or for a very long time. You must see a doctor before heading to an outpatient detox facility. They will be able to determine whether it\u2019s the right course of action for your recovery. If you are chemically dependent on alcohol, quitting or cutting back can be very challenging. Fortunately, there are medications available that can make the process easier. Talk to your doctor about trying one of these commonly prescribed medications:  Disulfiram (Antabuse) discourages drinking by interacting with alcohol to produce unpleasant physical reactions like nausea and headaches. However, this drug can also be addictive and should only be taken with very close doctor supervision. Naltrexone (Revia) prevents you from feeling the pleasant \u201cbuzz\u201d that alcohol normally produces. Naltrexone also comes in an injected version called Vivitrol. Acamprosate (Campral) reduces alcohol cravings. Delirium tremens are similar to alcohol withdrawal shakes, but they affect your whole body and are much more severe. If you experience severe whole-body tremors after you stop drinking, along with other symptoms such as hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, and seizures, seek medical attention immediately. You may need blood drawn to see if liver damage is to blame. If you find yourself in the position of dealing with someone else experiencing delirium, it can be difficult to know what to do. Read up on how to care for someone with delirium so you know what to do. Cirrhosis of the liver occurs when scar tissue builds up on the liver and makes it difficult for it to function. Severe cirrhosis is life-threatening, but when caught in the early stages, liver damage can be treated and limited (though not cured). If you notice any symptoms, see a doctor right away. Symptoms include:  Fatigue Easy bleeding and bruising Yellow discoloration in your skin and eyes Spidery blood vessels Swelling in your legs Redness on your palms Behavioral therapy, or addiction counseling, can help you develop healthy coping strategies and attainable goals as you work toward quitting or cutting back your alcohol use. This type of therapy can also help you uncover and work through underlying issues that may be contributing to your drinking habits. Ask your doctor to recommend a therapist who specializes in addiction or substance abuse. . Getting support from others who understand what you are going through is an important component of dealing with alcohol dependency. People in your support group can provide sympathy and friendship, and can also help hold you accountable or offer assistance if you find yourself in crisis or struggling with setbacks. Ask your doctor to recommend group therapy or peer-led support groups in your area. Do some research to see what groups are available, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Your family and friends can play a key role in helping you successfully recover from alcohol abuse. Let the people closest to you know that you are working to quit or cut back on your alcohol use. Ask them to respect your decision, and to help you by not drinking around you or putting pressure on you to drink in social situations. Identify a few close friends or family members that you can call on for support if you are in a bad place or struggling with the temptation to drink.

These types of approach are generative in nature, in so far as they aim to estimate a model of the document generation process. Often these generative document models are simple unigram mixture models that incorporate information from the background collection as well as information from a speci\ufb01c document. Thus, the main challenge is one of parameter estimation and consequently various smoothing approaches have been studied [12] that aim to better estimate the parameters of the document models given a collection of documents. In information retrieval, once the document models have been estimated, documents can be ranked by the likelihood of their document model generating the query (i.e. the query-likelihood approach [10]). Recently, document language models that exhibit a self-reinforcing property, via a multivariate P\u00b4olya process, have been shown to signi\ufb01cantly increase retrieval e\ufb00ectiveness [5]. This approach captures word burstiness in a documentspeci\ufb01c way. In this paper, we take this approach further and outline a more general process for statistical document modelling, one which encompasses a number of existing document language models as well as a number of novel variants.             \fIn Section 2, we outline a general model of document generation in terms of an urn scheme which crucially models the dynamics of document generation using a matrix M. Section 3 discusses speci\ufb01c instantiations of M, ones which lead to determining di\ufb00erent generative distributions. Section 4 outlines how the new general model is used for document retrieval. Section 5 outlines our experimental set-up. The results of a number of experiments are reported in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude with a discussion and outline some future work. 2 Generalised P\u00b4olya Let u0 be an urn initially containing |u0| balls in total where each ball is one of v distinct colours. Starting at time i = 0, a ball is drawn with replacement from the urn and a number of additional balls (possibly of di\ufb00erent colours) are added1 to the urn according to a replacement matrix M. Each row of this matrix determines the number of additional balls of each colour to add to the urn and the row is selected according to the colour of the ball drawn from the urn. Therefore, the dynamical nature of this random process is de\ufb01ned by this v2 matrix M. Now, if d = {ti} is a sequence of observations indexed from i = 0 to i = |d|\u22121 drawn from the urn, then the state of the urn can be describe as a recurrent process as follows: ui+1 = ui + eti \u00b7 M (1) where eti is a standard basis vector (a.k.a a one-hot vector2). At a particular time i and for an observation ti, the process essentially selects row ti of the matrix M and then combines it with the ith state of the urn ui. This imbues the urn with a reinforcing property, and in speci\ufb01c cases results in the traditional P\u00b4olya urn scheme. The generalised P\u00b4olya process is thus de\ufb01ned by both the replacement matrix M and the initial parameters u0 and so the likelihood of seeing a speci\ufb01c sample d can be written as p(d|u0, M). One can interpret u0 as completely de\ufb01ning the probability of seeing a particular coloured ball on the \ufb01rst draw, and can interpret M as de\ufb01ning the dynamics of the urn. These types of model are well-suited to modelling natural language where di\ufb00erent coloured balls represent di\ufb00erent word-types [7] and where the number of balls of each colour in the urn is proportional to the probability of generating a speci\ufb01c word.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.4, "base": 0.18181818181818182, "sft": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter2": 0.25, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_presence_check(\"document\", \"keep\")", "keyword_presence_check(\"language\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"document\", 5, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"language\", 3, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"information retrieval\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"document\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"language\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 4], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 2561, "ori_file_path": 2561, "source": "arxiv_483"}, "input_content": "Document language modelling is a crucial component in statistical approaches to information retrieval [10, 8, 12].

These types of approach are generative in nature, in so far as they aim to estimate a model of the document generation process. Often these generative document models are simple unigram mixture models that incorporate information from the background collection as well as information from a speci\ufb01c document. Thus, the main challenge is one of parameter estimation and consequently various smoothing approaches have been studied [12] that aim to better estimate the parameters of the document models given a collection of documents. In information retrieval, once the document models have been estimated, documents can be ranked by the likelihood of their document model generating the query (i.e. the query-likelihood approach [10]). Recently, document language models that exhibit a self-reinforcing property, via a multivariate P\u00b4olya process, have been shown to signi\ufb01cantly increase retrieval e\ufb00ectiveness [5]. This approach captures word burstiness in a documentspeci\ufb01c way. In this paper, we take this approach further and outline a more general process for statistical document modelling, one which encompasses a number of existing document language models as well as a number of novel variants.             \fIn Section 2, we outline a general model of document generation in terms of an urn scheme which crucially models the dynamics of document generation using a matrix M. Section 3 discusses speci\ufb01c instantiations of M, ones which lead to determining di\ufb00erent generative distributions. Section 4 outlines how the new general model is used for document retrieval. Section 5 outlines our experimental set-up. The results of a number of experiments are reported in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude with a discussion and outline some future work. 2 Generalised P\u00b4olya Let u0 be an urn initially containing |u0| balls in total where each ball is one of v distinct colours. Starting at time i = 0, a ball is drawn with replacement from the urn and a number of additional balls (possibly of di\ufb00erent colours) are added1 to the urn according to a replacement matrix M. Each row of this matrix determines the number of additional balls of each colour to add to the urn and the row is selected according to the colour of the ball drawn from the urn. Therefore, the dynamical nature of this random process is de\ufb01ned by this v2 matrix M. Now, if d = {ti} is a sequence of observations indexed from i = 0 to i = |d|\u22121 drawn from the urn, then the state of the urn can be describe as a recurrent process as follows: ui+1 = ui + eti \u00b7 M (1) where eti is a standard basis vector (a.k.a a one-hot vector2). At a particular time i and for an observation ti, the process essentially selects row ti of the matrix M and then combines it with the ith state of the urn ui. This imbues the urn with a reinforcing property, and in speci\ufb01c cases results in the traditional P\u00b4olya urn scheme. The generalised P\u00b4olya process is thus de\ufb01ned by both the replacement matrix M and the initial parameters u0 and so the likelihood of seeing a speci\ufb01c sample d can be written as p(d|u0, M). One can interpret u0 as completely de\ufb01ning the probability of seeing a particular coloured ball on the \ufb01rst draw, and can interpret M as de\ufb01ning the dynamics of the urn. These types of model are well-suited to modelling natural language where di\ufb00erent coloured balls represent di\ufb00erent word-types [7] and where the number of balls of each colour in the urn is proportional to the probability of generating a speci\ufb01c word.", "improve": [3]}}

The machine converts the information from the reflected sound waves into a picture. This does not hurt and is not dangerous for you. The doctor may use gel on your skin to make a better connection between your body and the ultrasound device. The procedure will last a few minutes. A computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scanner uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of your internal organs. You may be given a contrast material to make the organs show up better on the x-ray images. This can be done by having you swallow a liquid or by injecting it into a vein. While the scan is occurring you will lie on a table that will move you into the scanner. You may hear noises coming from the machine. The doctor will communicate with you through an intercom. The procedure may last about half an hour and will not hurt.  A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. An MRI machine uses magnets and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of your body. Because this test uses magnets, it is important that you tell the doctor if you have any metal or electronic implants in your body. This could include heart valves, a pacemaker, a heart defibrillator, shrapnel, bullet fragments, or a prosthetic joint. Your doctor may also give you a contrast material to make your kidneys show up better on the pictures. While the scan is being performed, you will lie on a table that moves into the scanner.

Generative AI covers a wide range of applications, the most typical of which is large language models (LLMs) [1]. A famous example is the GPT series [2], which has made noteworthy advancements in this domain [3]. The GPT series models represent typical examples of large-scale language models. Scholars have observed that as the parameter count of GPT language models grows, their natural language understanding capabilities become increasingly powerful. For instance, GPT-3 boasts 170 billion parameters [4]. This natural language understanding capability holds significant promise in both business and society and offers considerable potential in various domains [5]. The ability of natural language understanding is the most limiting factor in the field of question-answering (QA) systems. The QA systems are utilized in open-world scenarios, which often result in issues of questions and answers (QA) mismatching problems due to linguistic diversity [6]. The open-world scenario for the QA system usually means the training set is typically unable to encompass all possible user question inputs. The different expressions of the questions from users and the linguistic diversity usually lead to an unseen class problem [7], and this problem will further cause the QA mismatching problem and undermine the QA matching accuracy. Specifically, the negative impact caused by the unseen classes will be a disaster in the field of QA tasks with a fixed knowledge base, so-called Knowledge-based Question and Answer (KBQA) [8], as the mismatching problems will not just hurt the accuracy but might directly lead to the task failure. With the rapid development of large-scale knowledge bases, the open-domain Knowledge-based Question and Answer (KBQA) has emerged. KBQA system is to understand natural language questions and answers based on external knowledge [9]. The field of KBQA has gained significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. The open-source knowledge bases have enabled KBQAs to provide accurate answers across various domains. For example, the broad knowledge graph called Knowledge Vault (KV) [10] was integrated into Google\u2019s search engine for practical purposes and resulted in significant improvement in the user experience of the search engines. The basic idea of the KBQA is to find a mapping from the natural language question of users to the answers in the knowledge base.

When you introduce yourself, tell them how many years you've been working in your field and what you have achieved there. Then they'll know you know your stuff. Tell them how long you've been teaching your course. If you've been teaching the same course twenty times, let them know, so they have a sense that you've created the best course possible. If you're new to the classroom, however, don't let your students know so they don't see you as a pushover. Once the introductions are out of the way, it's important to let your students understand your expectations so they can meet them.  Have a well-organized syllabus that shows them exactly what to expect from every day of the course. Answer any questions they have after you go over it, so you can clear up any confusion. Whether you're teaching children or adults, it's important to have a clear code of conduct, which shows not only your expectations, but the punishments if your students fail to meet them. Common code of conduct rules include showing mutual respect and avoiding disruptive behavior, such as using texting, talking on the phone, or whispering in the back of the classroom. Whether you're giving a quiz or a final exam, it's important to make sure the assignment is fair and useful for your students. They will be better students after all of your hard work, and will thank you for being an understanding teacher and classroom leader.  Have a study guide. Before an exam, tell your students what they can expect to be on it so they don't have any surprises on the day of the test. Provide sample problems. Give your students practice problems so their skills are sharp on the day of the test. To be a good classroom leader, you have to find new ways to introduce boring old material to your students. If you don't mix things up, your students will get bored and distracted and may even lose respect for you.  Bring current events into class discussion. Even if you're not teaching a history class, you can find a way to bring up current events, whether it's something related to the government or sports, and tie them into your material. This will make your students feel that your discussion is relevant to the real world. Have unique activities that get your students moving and thinking. Allow your students to create their own paragraphs, board work, skits, or any other activity that may help them understand an old concept in a new way.

Tilt the clinometer until you can look through the straw or paper tube and see the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a building. You can use this method to measure the angle between you and the top of that object, or the object's height. Keep the clinometer steady in that position, until the dangling string becomes still. Calculate the angle between the midpoint of the protractor (90\u00ba), and the point where the string crosses the rim by subtracting one from the other. For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is 90\u201360=30\u00ba. If the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150-90=60\u00ba.  The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba since 90\u00ba is straight up in the sky. The answer will always be positive (greater than 0\u00ba). If you subtract the larger number from the smaller and get a negative number, just cross out the minus sign to get the right answer. For example, if you calculate that 60-90=-30\u00ba, the actual angle of elevation is +30\u00ba. The tangent of an angle is defined as the side of a right triangle opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the triangle is formed by three points: you, the base of the object, and the top of the object. The \"opposite\" side from this angle is the height of the object, and the adjacent side is the distance between you and the object's base.  You can use a scientific or graphing calculator, an online tangent calculator, or a chart listing tangents for various angles. To calculate the tangent on a calculator, press TAN and enter the angle you found. If the answer is below 0 or above 1, set your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again. If you want to find out how tall the object is, you'll need to know how far away you are from its base. Measure using a tape measure. If you don't have one, count the number of ordinary steps it takes to get to the object, then measure the length of one step once you find a ruler. The total distance is the length of one step multiplied by the number of steps you took.  Some protractors have rulers marked along the straight edge. Remember, the tangent of your angle is (object's height) / (distance between you and the object). Multiply the tangent by the distance you measured, and you'll be left with just the object's height!   For example, if the angle of elevation was 35\u00ba, and your distance from the object was 45 units, the object's height equals 45 x tangent(35\u00ba), or 31.5 units. Add your own height at eye level to your answer, since that's how far your clinometer was above the ground.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.5, "base": 0.19999999999999998, "sft": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.25}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"measure\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"clinometer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(5, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"tangent\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"clinometer\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5], \"change\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 5, 10], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1070, "ori_file_path": 1070, "source": "wle_492"}, "input_content": "Hold the clinometer so the curved rim of the protractor is facing downward.

When the water level is too high, water will constantly drain into the overflow tube. Be sure to fix this problem as soon as possible to prevent water from spilling out onto the floor causing major water damage if the toilet gets clogged.  With the water running and the tank full, look at the overflow tube. This is an open tube in the middle of the tank that connects the tank and the toilet bowl. Check to see if water keeps draining into the tube. If that\u2019s happening, you can adjust the water level by lowering the float. Water comes into a toilet tank via a fill valve. The fill valve has a float on it that rises or lowers with the water level. The float height is what tells the fill valve to shut off when the tank is full. Therefore, you can lower the water level in the tank by adjusting the height of the float. There are 2 main types of floats:  A float ball fill valve will have a long arm attached to the fill valve, and at the end of the arm there will be a rubber ball-shaped float. Shake the float ball to determine if there is water inside it. If so, replace it. A float cup fill valve will have a small circular cylinder wrapped around the body of the fill valve. The cylinder, or float cup, slides up and down on the fill valve shaft, and its height determines the water level. On top of the fill valve, there will be a screw attaching the float arm to the fill valve. When you turn this screw, you can adjust the height of the float. With a screwdriver, turn the screw a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float.  Flush the toilet and let the water in the tank refill. Check the water level. Ideally, the water level should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8\u00a0cm) below the top of the overflow tube. Continue adjusting the screw by quarter turns until the water level is right. The float on a float cup fill valve is adjusted in much the same way. There will be an adjustment screw on the top of the fill valve. When you turn this screw, it will adjust the height of the float. Turn the screw a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float.  Flush and refill the toilet tank. Check the water level. Make another quarter-turn adjustment if necessary until the water level in the tank is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8\u00a0cm) below the top of the overflow tube. The refill tube is a tube attached to the fill valve that fills the tank with water after it\u2019s been flushed. This tube should always be above the water line, otherwise it can lead to intermittent running. When the tank is full, make sure the tube isn't in the water. To correct a fill tube that dips into the water, simply trim enough of the tube so that it sits above the water line.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.25, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.25, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"float\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 5, 10], \"change\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 1537, "ori_file_path": 1537, "source": "wle_959"}, "input_content": "When flapper trouble isn't the cause of a running toilet, the next most common cause is the water level.

Choose your length. There are a few different lengths of blank cassette tape commonly available. The best lengths for making a mixtape are 60 minutes (30 on each side) or 90 minutes (45 on each side). Avoid 120 minute cassettes, as their sound quality is considerably lower. Once you've settled on a track list list (get some ideas below), stack your recorded music so that you can work your way through the stack from top to bottom as you make the mixtape. This will help keep you from losing track of the project as you record. If you are able to get lengths for each track, do so. This will help you organize your songs around the break that comes halfway through the tape. If your music collection is primarily digital but you would still like to make an old-fashioned cassette mixtape, all is not lost. Burn the songs you want to use onto blank CDs using your computer's optical recording drive, and then record to the tape from the CDs. Be sure that you burn a music disc and not a data disc, since data discs won't work with every kind of stereo. Alternatively, if you have a way to run your MP3 player's audio through your stereo, you can record directly from it onto the tape. Be aware that sound quality will typically take a hit if you use this method, compared to the CD method. There are cords that should be able to do this for most cassette players. If you can, use an integrated setup. Most stereo and hi-fi systems manufactured over the last few decades have a cassette recorder built into one of their integrated tape decks. Look for the tape deck with an extra button, which usually has a red dot on it. Let the tape play for a few seconds, until the sound changes to a smooth hiss, and then stop it. Put the first album you are copying a song from into the appropriate player on the stereo or hi-fi.  For CDs, pause the playback and skip tracks until you reach the track you want. For other cassettes, fast-forward to the song, and then stop or pause the tape. For LPs, leave the dust cover up and wait for a moment. Push the \u201crecord\u201d button on the recorder deck (this will push the \u201cplay\u201d button down automatically as well), and then start playing the song you picked. Pushing \u201crecord\u201d first ensures that none of the song gets clipped off at the start. If you're recording from an LP, drop the needle just before the song you want to record, and once the record reaches the silent space between tracks, push \u201crecord\u201d on the tape deck. Stay close to the stereo and push the \u201cstop\u201d button on the recorded deck as soon as your song is finished. This will stop the recording. You can then stop the first album and switch it out for the next song on your mixtape list. When your cassette reaches the end of the first side, it's time to flip it over and continue on the back. Listen to your mixtape through to make sure everything recorded correctly. If a song didn't come out right, record of that part of the tape until you are satisfied. Unless you carefully budgeted your time, it's likely that you'll end up with part of a song at the end of the first side. You can erase songs from your mixtape by recording over them while no music is playing.

However, these benchmarks feature mainly SAE, often neglecting nonstandard dialects such as AAVE *Lead Author \u2020Senior Author (Blodgett et al., 2020; Weidinger et al., 2021; Sap et al., 2019; Deas et al., 2023). This oversight results in biased and inequitable NLP systems that do not adequately serve a significant portion of speakers. The advent of LLMs such as GPT-4 has driven advances in NLU tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across various applications (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2024; Bubeck et al., 2023). Despite these advancements, LLMs exhibit persistent biases against nonstandard dialects, including AAVE, particularly in tasks involving natural language generation and toxicity detection (Zhou et al., 2021). These biases highlight the need for comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate model performance in different dialects, ensuring fair and reliable language technologies for all users (Gehrmann et al., 2021). Benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE have contributed significantly to the evaluation of NLP models, yet they focus mainly on SAE, neglecting crucial dialectal variations (Wang et al., 2019, 2020). Although VALUE has sought to bridge this gap by using deterministic linguistic transformations to assess model performance in AAVE, these transformations are often contextspecific and difficult to generalize, limiting their broader applicability (Ziems et al., 2022, 2023). To address these limitations, we introduce AAVENUE, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance across dialects, with a particular focus on AAVE. Our goal is to promote inclusivity and equity in NLP tools by providing a more comprehensive assessment of dialectal fairness. Our contributions are as follows: 1.

The type and amount will vary according to your pet\u2019s age, weight, and activity level, so be sure to consult the packaging for the correct serving sizes.  A dog\u2019s digestion will be healthiest if you give them a consistent diet. If you do change your dog\u2019s food, introduce the new kind gradually by mixing it in with the old at first. Keep in mind that how much you feed your dog is almost as important as what you feed them. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Since you want to feed your dog a set amount, it\u2019s best to control their feeding times rather than letting them graze throughout the day. Establish meal times once or twice a day to give your dog a sense of routine. Monitor your dog\u2019s treats. It\u2019s always wonderful to reward your canine companions with treats, but be sure that you\u2019re adjusting their normal food intake accordingly. If you feed your dog a bone, reduce the amount of kibble they\u2019ll get for dinner. Hydration is critical for your dog\u2019s nutrition, digestion, and joint health. It\u2019s also critical for the regulation of their body temperature. Your dog should always have a dish of fresh, clean water available, even at night.  If you go on car trips or outings, take water with you for your dog. Be sure to clean your dog\u2019s food bowl and water dish regularly to prevent mold, dirt, and bacteria from building up. Regularly brush your dog\u2019s teeth and give them canine dental products, like hard biscuits and dental chews to improve their oral hygiene. Toys that allow them to chew, like rope or nylon bones, will also help keep their teeth clean and gums healthy.   Brush your dog\u2019s teeth daily. This will prevent bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. You can lift their lips to expose their teeth and brush them as would your own. To be the most effective, use an angled brush that\u2019s specially designed for dogs. Always stick to toothpaste made for canines since the fluoride found in most human toothpastes is poisonous to dogs. It\u2019s your job to monitor your pet\u2019s food intake and feed them an appropriate amount for their size and ideal weight. While it may seem cruel to deny your dog the food that they\u2019re begging for, letting your dog get obese is more cruel since it compromises their health and well-being. If your dog is overweight, ask your vet to recommend a diet to help get them get back to an appropriate weight. Canines have very different nutritional needs than humans, so stick to feeding them dog food to ensure they\u2019re getting a healthy and well-balanced diet. They also have different medical needs, so never assume that the remedies that work for us will work for them.  Be aware that many of our common food items are poisonous or even lethal to dogs, like raisins, grapes, mushrooms, onions, macadamia nuts, caffeine, chocolate (especially dark chocolate and baking chocolate), alcoholic beverages, dairy products such as milk, and citrus fruits such as oranges.  Only give your dog medicines that have been explicitly prescribed or approved by a vet. Many human drugs\u2014over-the-counter or prescription\u2014can kill your dog. For instance, aspirin may be given to a dog if your vet tells you it is alright and tells you the proper dosage. But acetaminophen and ibuprofen are highly poisonous for your pooch. Have a canine first aid kit on hand to address your dog\u2019s medical needs. You can either buy one or put one together yourself. Make sure it includes basic supplies like a pet first-aid book, self-cling bandages, gauze pads, an antibacterial ointment or antiseptic wipes, disposable gloves, scissors, and tweezers. Having an established veterinarian-owner-patient relationship with regular check-ups will help ensure that your dog is as healthy as possible and up-to-date with their vaccinations and parasite control.  When searching for a vet, be sure to choose one that is nearby to where you live and has good online reviews. Go to your vet regularly to minimize your dog\u2019s risk of contracting and spreading dangerous diseases (like rabies or kennel cough) or parasites (like fleas and heartworm). Your vet will keep records to remind you when preventative treatments need to be administered. How often you should visit the vet will depend on the health and age of your dog. Puppies will need several appointments in their first year, but a normal, healthy adult dog can generally get by with an annual check-up. Senior dogs who are pushing ten years of age should probably go in at least twice a year.  Your vet can also help you decide when it\u2019s time to let go. When your pet is stuck in a cycle of incurable suffering due to sickness or old age, the best thing you can do for them is to seek your vet\u2019s help to end your pet's life humanely. Responsible dog owners will control their pet\u2019s reproduction. Neuter or spay your dog as soon as your vet recommends doing so to prevent unwanted litters adding to the numbers in shelters as well as adolescent behavior problems that arise from sex hormones. Alternative options are available, too, such as Vasectomy, Neutering, Tubal Ligation and Ovary-Sparing Spay (OSS). While harder to come by, they come with less long term health risks than spaying and neutering. Spaying and neutering comes with many associated health risks such as different types of cancers, orthopedic disorders and cardiac hemangiosarcoma.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.4, "sft": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": [], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"dog\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"dog\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 7, 13], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"food\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo": [], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 921, "ori_file_path": 921, "source": "wle_343"}, "input_content": "Get recommendations from your vet or breeder as to which foods work best for your dog\u2019s breed.

It's gonna tell you what's practical and what's acceptable and just dare you not to listen. Don't! Do you want to move to New York, be a go-go dancer, and eat only Ramen noodles for the rest of your life? If so, go for it. Those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter, after all. Find a passion. Everyone is better with a passion. And stick to it! If the world mocks you for it, you're in the wrong group of people. You're at your best when you're happiest. Seek your passions, regardless of what others think, do, or say. Being selfish the right way is an art. It is the ability to discern when what's best for you is still what's best for the situation at hand. It's knowing when your desire of something isn't really justified versus when it means being content with your life. If you refuse to let your friend pick the movie you go to, you're being controlling and selfish. If you don't go to her dance recital because you picked up another shift at work to pay the electric bill, you're being logical. Know the difference. This isn't just with others -- this is with you, too. There will be times in your life when you can be selfish and times when you straight up shouldn't be. Do you really want to move in with this guy you met online who lives on the coast of Australia? Or should you take that opportunity to work with the Habitat for Humanity who's offering you a hefty scholarship for college? Sometimes what's best for you isn't what you want -- but will be what you want down the line. Sometimes it's best to just shut out the world for a moment and have some well-deserved me time. Sometimes it's the only remedy! Take a bit of time each day -- whether it's at home, work, or on a run -- to just do you. Destressing is important for all your daily activities. You're just improving your productivity! Try meditation, yoga, or simply go for a walk. If that's not an option, take 10 minutes at your desk to daydream. The downtime will energize you for the rest of your obligations and give you much needed focus. Humility is practically shoved down our throats, isn't it? Someone offers you a compliment and you're taught to say, \"Aww, no, it wasn't that good. Plus, so many other people helped me.\" Don't do it! Relish it. Accept it. You've earned it! We all need to give ourselves a pat on the back once in a while. And if others do it for us, great! Those people want to compliment us -- let them! They wouldn't go out of their way if they didn't want to. Friends are getting together for pizza and beer on Thursday night when you promised yourself you'd go the gym, but they're depending on your place for the large screen TV? Too bad. You have plans that you don't feel like breaking. They can do their thing elsewhere. You have calories to burn! It's fine to be an inconvenience.

My hubs is not the type to go above and beyond for things, but he is thoughtful. So when he said we could go to my favourite restaurant, Hamirs, and go and see a movie, I was excited to do so! I had not been to Hamir's in so long, and I know my hubs isn't the biggest Indian food fan, so I thought it was so sweet that he would want to go there anyway, even though it's not his favourite. When we went to Hamirs, I noticed there were gorgeous sheets in these beautiful Indian prints hanging over the front windows. Usually the windows are really open and you can see inside. When we walked in, I was completely overwhelmed to see about a dozen of my friends and close co-workers! I was so surprised! When I was hugging everyone and screaming and smiling and 'yay'ing' over it, I noticed in the corner, my best friend from HS, waiting for me!! I couldn't believe it! She had come all the way from Massachusetts to see me! I started crying and she started crying, and we had such a moment! I had not seen her for about 3-4 years. The food was absolutely amazing and the conversation and just ambiance was so perfect! Hamir made my favourite dish, which is the chicken tandoori! The dinner and my friends showing up was a big enough gift, but I also received so many awesome gifts! Lots of Starbucks and Sephora gift cards! My best friend got me a Kate Spade wallet. My mom and sister got me a new pair of headphones. My husband went above and beyond for this one, it was crazy. I couldn't believe he went to all this, and behind my back without me knowing. Somehow, he was able to reach out to everyone. When I asked him how he did it, he said he found our addresses/email list that I keep on excel on our computer, and he was able to contact everyone via the email addresses I had in there. I was super bummed because I didnt take any photos but luckily, so many of my friends came through! When I got on facebook and IG the next day, there were so many tagged photos. It was awesome to see the different people in my life all in one space. My work friends, my new friends my old friends, and my family.

Traditional NER models are limited to a predefined set of entity types. Expanding the number of entity types can be beneficial for many applications but may involve labeling additional datasets. The emergence of Large Language Models, like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), has introduced a new era for open-type NER by enabling the identification of any types of entity types only by natural language instruction. This shift signifies a significant departure from the inflexibility observed in traditional models. However, powerful LLMs typically consist of billions of parameters and thus require substantial computing resources. Although it is possible to access some LLMs via APIs (OpenAI, 2023), using them at scale can incur high costs. Recently, researchers have explored the finetuning of open source language models such as Figure 1: BiLM for Open NER. Previous models, such as UniNER (Zhou et al., 2023) (Fig. a), approach the task of open type NER by prompting LLMs with natural language instructions (using a multi-turn dialogue style). Our proposed GLiNER utilizes small bidirectional LMs and treats the NER task as matching entity types with textual spans in a latent space.

Additionally, GoLLIE (Sainz et al., 2023) was introduced as an extension of InstructUIE work by by finetuning a CodeLLaMa (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) using detailed annotation guidelines, resulting in significant performance improvements.

GLiNER employs a BiLM and takes as input entity type prompts and a sentence/text. Each entity is separated by a learned token [ENT]. The BiLM outputs representations for each token. Entity embeddings are passed into a FeedForward Network, while input word representations are passed into a span representation layer to compute embeddings for each span. Finally, we compute a matching score between entity representations and span representations (using dot product and sigmoid activation). For instance, in the figure, the span representation of (0, 1), corresponding to \"Alain Farley,\" has a high matching score with the entity embeddings of \"Person\". datasets. Their approach enables the replication and even surpassing of the original capability of ChatGPT when evaluated in zero-shot on several NER datasets. While these works have achieved remarkable results, they present certain limitations we seek to address: They use autoregressive language models, which can be slow due to tokenby-token generation; Moreover, they employ large models with several billion parameters, limiting their deployment in compute-limited scenarios. Furthurmore, as NER is treated as a text generation problem, the generation of entities is done in several decoding steps, and there is no way to perform the prediction of multiple entity types in parallel. In our work, we propose a model that addresses the above-mentioned problems. Instead of relying on large autoregressive models, we utilize smallerscale Bidirectional Language Models (BiLM), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or deBERTa (He et al., 2021). The core concept of our model involves treating the task of Open NER as matching entity type embeddings to textual span representations in latent space, rather than as a generation task. This approach naturally solves the scalability issues of autoregressive models and allows for bidirectional context processing, which enables richer representations. When trained on the dataset released by (Zhou et al., 2023), which comprises texts from numerous domains and thousands of entity types, our model demonstrates impressive zero-shot performance.

Finally, we compute a matching score between entity representations and span representations (using dot product and sigmoid activation). For instance, in the figure, the span representation of (0, 1), corresponding to \"Alain Farley,\" has a high matching score with the entity embeddings of \"Person\". datasets. Their approach enables the replication and even surpassing of the original capability of ChatGPT when evaluated in zero-shot on several NER datasets. While these works have achieved remarkable results, they present certain limitations we seek to address: They use autoregressive language models, which can be slow due to tokenby-token generation; Moreover, they employ large models with several billion parameters, limiting their deployment in compute-limited scenarios. Furthurmore, as NER is treated as a text generation problem, the generation of entities is done in several decoding steps, and there is no way to perform the prediction of multiple entity types in parallel. In our work, we propose a model that addresses the above-mentioned problems. Instead of relying on large autoregressive models, we utilize smallerscale Bidirectional Language Models (BiLM), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or deBERTa (He et al., 2021). The core concept of our model involves treating the task of Open NER as matching entity type embeddings to textual span representations in latent space, rather than as a generation task. This approach naturally solves the scalability issues of autoregressive models and allows for bidirectional context processing, which enables richer representations. When trained on the dataset released by (Zhou et al., 2023), which comprises texts from numerous domains and thousands of entity types, our model demonstrates impressive zero-shot performance. More specifilcally, it outperforms both ChatGPT and fine-tuned LLMs on zero-shot NER datasets (Table 1). Our model\u2019s robustness is further evident in its ability to handle languages not even encountered during training. Specifically, our model surpasses ChatGPT in 8 of 10 languages (Table 3) that were not included in its training data.", "improve": [3]}}

Fine-tuning Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) for specific downstream tasks has become an essential step in real-world implementations (Alt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). In general, achieving significant performance gains in fine-tuning PLMs necessitates the availability of task-specific data for finetuning (Zhou and Chen, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). However, obtaining high-quality labeled datasets for this purpose poses significant challenges due to the expensive, complex, and labor-intensive nature of the annotation process (Yu et al., 2019; Bae et al., 2022). For example, large-scale datasets, often derived from web-crawling (Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) or crowd-sourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2021), frequently suffer from the presence of noisy labels. Zhen Tan Arizona State University Jundong Li University of Virginia Figure 1: The average confidence of clean and noisy samples during fine-tuning BERT on datasets 20Ng and AGNews with 20% noisy labels. Prior research (Arpit et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021c; Wang et al., 2023a) has shown that PLMs are prone to overfitting and generally deliver subpar performance when fine-tuned on datasets containing label noise. Since fine-tuning involves incorporating supervision information to enhance performance on downstream tasks, the presence of noisy labels will mislead the training process and significantly impede the efficacy of PLMs (Zhu et al., 2022). Therefore, there is an immediate need to design effective algorithms for fine-tuning PLMs in the presence of noisy labels. In the context of learning from noisy labels, an intuitive approach is to separate clean samples from the noisy ones in the training set for model training (Han et al., 2018). For the remaining noisy samples, a prevalent strategy is to pseudo-label them based on model predictions to reduce the adverse impact of noise (Berthelot et al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2020). However, it remains challenging when applying this paradigm to PLMs. This is because PLMs, equipped with prior knowledge encoded in a large size of parameters, tend to easily memorize noisy samples early on during the fine-tuning process. As illustrated in Figure 1, PLMs exhibit similar prediction confidences for both clean and noisy samples, which will result in two challenges \u0000\u0014\u0000\u0015\u0000\u0016\u0000\u0017\u0000\u0018\u0000\u0019\u0000\u001a\u0000\u001b\u0000\u001c\u0000(\u0000S\u0000R\u0000F\u0000K\u0000\u0013\u0000\u0011\u0000\u0015\u0000\u0013\u0000\u0011\u0000\u0017\u0000\u0013\u0000\u0011\u0000\u0019\u0000\u0013\u0000\u0011\u0000\u001b\u0000&\u0000R\u0000Q\u0000I\u0000L\u0000G\u0000H\u0000Q\u0000F\u0000H\u0000&\u0000O\u0000H\u0000D\u0000Q\u0000\u0010\u0000\u0015\u0000\u0013\u00001\u0000J\u00001\u0000R\u0000L\u0000V\u0000\\\u0000\u0010\u0000\u0015\u0000\u0013\u00001\u0000J\u0000&\u0000O\u0000H\u0000D\u0000Q\u0000\u0010\u0000$\u0000*\u00001\u0000H\u0000Z\u0000V\u00001\u0000R\u0000L\u0000V\u0000\\\u0000\u0010\u0000$\u0000*\u00001\u0000H\u0000Z\u0000V            \fwhen utilizing existing methods: (1) Existing approaches often rely on confidences generated by models trained on potentially noisy samples (Li et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2022). However, as shown in Figure 1, it is challenging to accurately distinguish clean and noisy samples solely based on confidences. (2) Existing methods are susceptible to erroneous information during pseudo-labeling, as they directly utilize model predictions as pseudolabels, which can be detrimental when the predictions are inaccurate. PLMs, being capable of easily remembering noisy samples, further exacerbate the risk of capturing and amplifying erroneous information during pseudo-labeling. For example, in the 20Ng dataset (Lang, 1995), when an \"autos\" sample is assigned a wrong label \"hardware\", PLMs can easily memorize the erroneous information and thus cannot infer the correct labels in predictions, resulting in incorrect pseudo-labeling. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LAFT, that harnesses the power of Large LAnguage Models (LLMs) for Fine-Tuning PLMs. We leverage LLMs trained on extensive corpora and fine-tuned with human instructions, such as GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023), to obtain external guidance in the form of confidence values. Our approach addresses the first challenge of separating reliable samples by utilizing LLMgenerated confidences for each class of all training samples. By comparing these confidences with the assigned labels (i.e., the given noisy labels) of training samples, we categorize them into three disjoint subsets: the Easy Clean (EC) Set, the Hard Clean (HC) Set, and the True Noisy (TN) Set. Regarding the second challenge, we propose a novel method to incorporate LLM-generated confidence scores as robust supervision information for all samples to ensure that PLMs learn useful information from them. As LLM-generated confidences are not affected by label noise, they can provide potentially relevant labels that are useful even if they are not entirely accurate. In summary, our contributions are as follows: \u2022 We are the first to explore the potential of leveraging supervision information (i.e., confidence scores) generated by LLMs to tackle the noisy label problem in fine-tuning PLMs. \u2022 We propose a novel framework LAFT that can effectively separate clean and noisy samples and learn from noisy labels, based on the LLMsgenerated confidences. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our framework in fine-tuning PLMs with noisy labels.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": [], "tool_scores": {"base": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.2222222222222222, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()"]}}, "other_info": {"input_info": {"ori_sent_id": 2601, "ori_file_path": 2601, "source": "arxiv_523"}, "input_content": "In recent years, the development of language models has significantly expanded the applications within the field of natural language processing (NLP). Fine-tuning Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) for specific downstream tasks has become an essential step in real-world implementations (Alt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). In general, achieving significant performance gains in fine-tuning PLMs necessitates the availability of task-specific data for finetuning (Zhou and Chen, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). However, obtaining high-quality labeled datasets for this purpose poses significant challenges due to the expensive, complex, and labor-intensive nature of the annotation process (Yu et al., 2019; Bae et al., 2022). For example, large-scale datasets, often derived from web-crawling (Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) or crowd-sourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2021), frequently suffer from the presence of noisy labels.

Prior research (Arpit et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021c; Wang et al., 2023a) has shown that PLMs are prone to overfitting and generally deliver subpar performance when fine-tuned on datasets containing label noise. Since fine-tuning involves incorporating supervision information to enhance performance on downstream tasks, the presence of noisy labels will mislead the training process and significantly impede the efficacy of PLMs (Zhu et al., 2022). Therefore, there is an immediate need to design effective algorithms for fine-tuning PLMs in the presence of noisy labels. In the context of learning from noisy labels, an intuitive approach is to separate clean samples from the noisy ones in the training set for model training (Han et al., 2018). For the remaining noisy samples, a prevalent strategy is to pseudo-label them based on model predictions to reduce the adverse impact of noise (Berthelot et al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2020). However, it remains challenging when applying this paradigm to PLMs. This is because PLMs, equipped with prior knowledge encoded in a large size of parameters, tend to easily memorize noisy samples early on during the fine-tuning process.

Think carefully about the questions you choose, and don\u2019t ask anything you\u2019d really rather not know. Don't try to uncover deep, hurtful secrets, and beware of asking too many questions about his previous relationships. You could end up with hurt feelings, or you could dig up painful memories he'd rather forget about. Maybe there\u2019s something you\u2019ve always been curious about, but it never seemed like the right time to bring it up. Truth or Dare is the perfect excuse to get the answer to whatever\u2019s been nagging at you!  If you\u2019ve always wanted to know why he has a tattoo of a lion on his shoulder or why his nickname is \u201cTurbinado,\u201d now\u2019s the time to ask! Other questions might include something like, \u201cWhat did you think of me when we first met?\u201d or \u201cDid you know that I liked you before we ever started talking?\u201d Sometimes guys can be a little reluctant to talk about themselves as a kid, thinking it might make them seem less \u201cmanly.\u201d Show him that you care about all of the experiences that shaped him into who he is by asking questions about his childhood!  You could ask something like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite childhood memory?\u201d Get even more specific by asking, \u201cWhat was the best birthday you ever had?\u201d or \u201cWhat was your favorite toy when you were little?\u201d Talking about the future doesn\u2019t always have to mean planning your relationship together. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how he pictures himself in 5, 10, or 20 years, ask him!  For instance, you might say something like, \u201cIf you could have any job in the whole world, what would it be?\u201d You could also ask, \u201cWhere are 4 places you want to travel to some day?\u201d Give him the chance to compliment you by asking him what he sees in you! You can ask him specifically what qualities he likes, or what physical features he loves, or you could leave it open-ended. For example, you could say, \u201cWhat\u2019s something you love about me?\u201d His answer might be your eyes, your style, or the way you always answer the phone when your little sister calls, no matter what. You can get a lot of insight into someone by asking questions about how they see themselves. Just like asking him what he likes about you, this line of questioning can either be specific or can leave him room to interpret it however he wants.  You could ask him something like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite part about your face?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s your least favorite body part?\u201d to learn how he sees himself physically. To get to know his values better, ask him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the moment in your life you\u2019re most proud of so far?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s something you really regret doing?\u201d Not all of the questions have to be serious! Mix in some silly questions, like what would happen if he suddenly discovered he was a female. Other silly questions might include, \u201cWhat animal would you be if you had to pick one?\u201d or \u201cWhat celebrity would you trade bodies with?\u201d As the game goes on, you should pick harder and harder questions for him. While you might not want to ask him anything too secret, you can find out things he might not admit otherwise!  Ask him questions like, \"What's your biggest fear?\" to find out what he's afraid of.
