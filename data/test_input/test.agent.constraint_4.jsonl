Keep the term 'all day' unchanged:\n\nMy birthday is August 6th and this is the most memorable day to me.  I woke up that morning to check my facebook and was able to see all the wonderful people that told me Happy Birthday this year.  Oh and by the way, my husband forgot my birthday!  After all I am 35 and as you get older the less people celebrate you on your birthday and the more you hate celebrating because it means you are getting older.  So, back to the rest of the day, I sat there alone all day and then got a call from my best friend Callie Jane.  She told me she was thinking about me but had also forgot the exact day of my birthday.  I understood as I have trouble remembering as well these days too.  I told her it was actually today and that we would be celebrating my birthday at Oscar's it is a local bar and grill.  She told me that she would definitely make it.  Well two hours later I get a call from my husband as he is getting off work at this time.  It was around 3 that afternoon.  He tells me that he is sorry that he forgot my birthday and that he had talked to my best friend Callie Jane as well.  He told me that she wanted to throw a party for me at her place and asked what kind of cake I wanted.  I said that was okay, and that I wanted a cheesecake because I do not like regular cake.  So the plans were set, I was going to her house for my birthday.  She called me later that evening and told me that we would have a fish fry and cake.  I think I was 21 the last time it happened.  I also love fish and knew she was getting me a cheesecake.  So anyways, fast forward to the day of my party.  We get there and she has balloons and it is all decorated just for me.  Her and her friend Cara, that I recently met, put the whole party together.  But wait, that is not it, they also had me a gift.  It was a munchie basket.  I also got a homemade necklace from Cara which I love.

If you've ever seen a kitten get handled this way by its mother, you'll see that the kitten instinctively becomes still and draws his limbs close to his body. Many cats will continue to do this as adults when they are grabbed by the scruff. Avoid scruffing your cat in situations that would agitate the cat or increase the risk of injury for you or your cat.  When your cat is sleeping\u2212just like how you would not want to be grabbed when you are sleeping, scruffing your cat when he is sleeping would startle him. When your cat is eating\u2013let him finish eating first before doing something that may require him to be scruffed. When he is agitated or excited\u2212he may be particularly difficult to calm down or handle while he is worked up, which could increase the likelihood of you being scratched or bitten.  If your cat has arthritis or is obese\u2013scruffing can strain the neck muscles, which could be especially painful in a cat with arthritis or who is extremely overweight. If your cat does not have much scruff\u2013some cats simply don't have much of a scruff. You should be able to sense this when you grab the scruff. Don't attempt to hold your cat if he has a meager scruff. If your cat is old\u2212adult cats may feel humiliated or embarrassed when being scruffed. Although your cat may not be a fan of getting his nails trimmed, keeping him as still as possible will help you clip his nails more quickly and keep you from getting scratched or bitten.   Trim his nails when he is calm and relaxed, rather than he when is stressed or worked up from vigorous play.  Your cat should be laying down on a supportive surface (eg, table, counter top) when you scruff him to trim his nails. This will be more comfortable for both you and the cat. This step may require 2 people (1 person scruffing, 1 person trimming the nails). If you are trimming your cat's nails or administering medication to him, you will not need to lift him in the air after scruffing him. In these instances, you would gently push his head toward the supportive surface and use your other hand or arm to gently restrain his back end. Combing out mats in your cat\u2019s fur is not the most comfortable experience for your cat; it may even be painful for him. Since he may want to move around when having the mats combed out, keeping him still will be important.  Just like with trimming your cat\u2019s nails, place him on a supportive surface prior to scruffing him to comb out the mats. Use a wide-toothed comb.  With your free hand, hold the mat as close to the skin as possible and comb it out from the bottom to the top\u2013just as you would do if you were combing out a knot in person\u2019s hair. Cats can be particularly difficult when someone tries to give them medications. Keeping your cat still will increase your chances that you will be able to give him his treatment.  Scruff him on a supportive surface. If you are trying to give him a pill, tilt his head up slightly while you are scruffing him to put the pill in his mouth. For injectable medications, it may be safer to have your veterinarian or veterinary technician will scruff the cat and administer the medication, rather than trying to do this at home. This should be done sparingly, since scruffing him may actually make the situation worse.  If you must scruff him to discipline him, say the word \u2018no\u2019 while you are doing it so that he knows that he has misbehaved.  Also, scruff him gently to discipline him. Scruffing your cat roughly when he is in trouble will likely agitate him.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 24th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [24]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.4444444444444445}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detect()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"scruff\", 5, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Mother\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"scruff\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([24], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"]}}}

However, most studies remain con\ufb01ned to a small number of languages with large amounts of training data available. Low-resource languages, for example, e.g., African languages, are still underrepresented although they are spoken by over a billion people. In this context, the AfriSenti shared task provides a Twitter dataset for sentiment analysis on 14 African languages, promoting the future development of this \ufb01eld. The shared task consists of three sub-tasks: monolingual (Subtask A), multilingual (Subtask B), and zero-shot cross-lingual sentiment analysis (Subtask C). A detailed description can be found in the shared task description papers (Muhammad et al., 2023a,b). In this paper, we describe our submission as Neither Language Nor Domain Experts (NLNDE)1 to the AfriSenti shared task. Given the key challenge of limited training data, we \ufb01rst adopt the languageadaptive and task-adaptive pretraining approaches (Gururangan et al., 2020), i.e., LAPT and TAPT, to adapt a pretrained language model to the language and task of interest. Further pretraining the model with such smaller but more task-relevant corpora leads to performance gains in all subtasks. Second, Cross-lingual transfer has been shown to be an effective method for enhancing the performance of low-resource languages by leveraging one or more similar languages as source languages (Lin et al., 2019; Ruder and Plank, 2017; Nasir and Mchechesi, 2022). However, the 14 African languages covered in this shared task (see Table 1) come from different language families and, therefore, hold different linguistic characteristics. As dissimilar languages could hurt the transfer performance (Lin et al., 2019; Adelani et al., 2022), it is important to choose promising languages as the transfer source. Therefore, our system uses transfer learning with an explicit selection of source languages. We apply this approach to the multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual sentiment analysis tasks (Subtask B and C) and demonstrate that it bene\ufb01ts the performance of each target language. In addition, we investigate different source language selection strategies and show their impact on the \ufb01nal transfer performance. Our \ufb01nal submission results are the ensemble of the best models with different random seeds. Our system is ranked \ufb01rst in 6 out of 12 languages in subtask A (monolingual), achieves the \ufb01rst place in subtask B (multilingual), and wins for one of 1We neither know any African languages nor have prior knowledge of the Twitter domain dataset. 22 r p A2 ] L C . s c [ v90.02 : v i X r a             \ftwo languages in subtask C for the zero-shot crosslingual transfer.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 28 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'african'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "african", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.20000000000000004, "base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["- `sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")`", "- `sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")`", "- `word_count_check(400, \"less than\")`", "- `keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")`"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"African\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"African\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"african\", \"keep\")"]}}}

I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day.

Ensure the revised version contains fewer than 38 sentences, and do not alter the word 'speech'. Each sentence should have more than five tokens, and the entire output should exceed 460 tokens:\n\nThe content, including word choice, references and anecdotes, should be tailored to the audience who will be listening to the speech. For example, a \"don't do drugs\" speech aimed at first graders will sound very different from one meant to teach awareness to college students. As you listen to the speech, try to determine whether it hits the mark or seems a bit off.  Do not base your critique on your own personal opinion, but on how the speaker would be perceived by a wider audience. Your own biases should not come into play. If possible, note audience members\u2019 reactions to the speech. Do they seem to understand it? Are they rapt with attention? Do they laugh along with the jokes, or do they seem bored? The speaker should use correct grammar and easy to understand language, making it pleasant to listen to the speech and follow what it\u2019s about. Within a few sentences, the main subject of the speech should be clear, and the rest of the content should build in a smooth, understandable manner to support the speaker\u2019s thesis. Again, whether or not you agree with or like the speaker should be less important than what the speaker is saying. When you\u2019re deciding whether the speech is clear, consider the following questions:  Is the introduction effective? Did the speaker make his or her primary argument apparent within the first few sentences, or did it take awhile before you figured out what he or she was getting at?  Is the speech full of distracting tangents that do not relate to the primary argument, or does it build in a logical manner toward the conclusion? If you were to repeat the speech to someone else, could you recite all the main points or would you have trouble remembering what it was really about? In a well-written speech, arguments are skillfully put forth to prove a larger point. The content of the speech should demonstrate the speaker\u2019s expertise on the subject at hand, and the audience should come away feeling they learned something new. Look for gaps in the speaker\u2019s reasoning or places where further research would have made a point more convincing.  Listen for names, dates, and data cited to back up the points the speaker is making. Write down any names, dates, statistics, and other research-related information given by the speaker so that you can look it up later. After the speech, do some fact checking to make sure they\u2019re accurate.  Inaccuracies in data are very important to notice because they can impact the credibility of the talk. If you must critique the speech directly after it is given, using the internet to quickly fact-check a speech can be useful. Wait for the question and answer, meet and greet, or break period to look up the speaker's points. Anecdotes and the occasional joke break up the serious tone of the speech and keep it from getting boring. If the speech is too dry, it doesn\u2019t matter how convincing the argument is; people will never hear it, because they\u2019ll be too distracted. When you\u2019re determining whether the speech is engaging at a high level, ask these questions:  Does it start with a good hook? In order to engage people right away, good speeches usually start with a funny or intriguing point that draws the audience in. Does it stay engaging the entire time? A good speaker will pepper anecdotes and jokes throughout to grab and keep listeners' attention. Are the anecdotes and jokes distracting, or do they help build the speaker\u2019s argument? Some listeners will tend to miss the important points, listening only to the hook. The best way to properly critique a speech is to wait for the speaker to make a joke and then listen very closely to what he or she says afterward. Think of jokes and anecdotes as highlighter pens, pointing out the main ideas. Does the speaker use illustrations judiciously? One really superb, memorable illustration is better than three that don't stick with the audience and are only partially related to the main goal of the speech. A good close should tie up all of the points and give the audience new ideas for using the information they've been given. A poor closing will only summarize the points, or outright ignore them and go on to a topic that has nothing to do with what the speaker has been saying for the rest of the allotted time period.  Remember that the ending of a speech is one of the most important parts in the speech making process. It should regain the audience's attention and be powerful, thoughtful, deep, and concise. When ending a speech, the speaker must also exhibit the greatest level of confidence one can muster, since this technique will help the audience also gain confidence in the speaker's presentation.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 38 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 38}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'speech'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "speech", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666665}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"speech\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(38, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(450, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"]}}}

Do not alter the word 'May' and keep the 19th sentence unchanged:\n\nA few months ago back in May, I was taking my two English bulldogs for a walk in the woods behind my house. They are about mid-aged dogs still capable of going on walks, except our male bulldog has some breathing issues. He is always rearin' to go and was ecstatic to take a walk in unfamiliar territory (they hadn't gone on walks in our woods before). We were walking in the woods going on what I thought was going to be a casual, twenty to thirty minute walk at most. I was certain Ralphie (Breathing problem dog) and KC could handle it. That thought quickly went out the window as went deeper into the woods into unfamiliar territory that I did not know about. What I thought was the right way back seemed to lead to more confusion with trees galore, and streams surrounding us. \"This does not seem right at all. Where are we?\" I kept saying to myself mentally, and occasionally to the two furry friends I had right next to me. The only difference this time is they were panting and breathing heavy. Their movements were slowed, at this point I was getting nervous.. I did not know how long we were in the woods, wandering around with me trying to use my intuition and internal sense of direction. Starting to become fearful, I received a sign that I never thought was possible. In the trees next to me where \"P\"'s or \"9\"'s made of felt. They were hanging off random tree branches and it seemed so out of place. I immediately thought \"Maybe this is a sign from God and the angels about how to get home?\" I thought to myself that this must mean I have to go back to the 9'oclock direction, aka to the left. Half an hour of walking later (or so it seemed) and with my dogs nearing the end span of their endurance with their movements very slowed and heavy breathing, there was hope! We were nearing familiar territory getting closer to our home! \"Almost there!\" I kept telling my dogs and myself. Ralphie and KC were exhausted! I was fearful, but filled with hope. We cleared through the woods and finally reached our destination -- home sweet home! I picked at least a dozen ticks off each dog and got a minor scalding from my stepdad about taking them for long walks. Not my intention, but that day I know I had divine help from God and the beautiful angels.

Private sellers may keep records of any repairs or maintenance done on the vehicle, and this will tell you the general health of the car. If they do not know the history, you'll absolutely need to do a thorough check through the DMV.  Ask if they have made any modifications (\"mods\") to the car, and who did them. Ask, at the very least, for the mechanical history of the car since the current owner bought it. If they made repairs or changes themselves, it is up to you whether or not you trust them. The DMV has a record of any accidents involving the car, as does Carfax.com, so that you can do a more detailed search. Use the VIN, located on the steering column in the interior, on the engine, or etched on the windshield, to get specific car information. The most likely location of the VIN is on the lower left-hand corner of the windshield (looking from the driver's seat). Check the body for obvious damage or signs of previous heavy repairs, the tires for any obvious defects such as cracks or under-inflation or excessive wear, and the engine for any signs of physical damage. Use a small pocket magnet to find areas where plastic putty (bondo) was used to repair body damages. A paint thickness tester with a digital display will help to detect clunkers. Be aware of the fact that private sellers are not prevented in any way from selling damaged cars, and can hide the origin of the car through title washing, a process of selling a car and re-registering it in a new state. Mineral deposits, discoloration, water stains on the interior, strong odor from cleaners, or deposited flotsam are all sure indicators of water damage. Any water damage to the engine or interior of the car is likely to leave the car totaled. Check in the wheel wells, the rockers, the floorboards, and trunk. Repairing or reversing rust is an expensive process. Indicators of shoddy bodywork include mismatched paint, use of plastic or fiberglass filler, or gaps between body panels. The odometer is generally reliable, but wear on seat upholstery and the pedals are sure indicators of use as well. You should be alert when you find new pedal rubbers! The Kelley Blue Book offers a calculator for the price impact of mileage. Have this calculator handy.  Note, however, that Kelly Blue Book prices will vary from zip code to zip code, so check prices in your own town, not where you buy the car. If they are worn unevenly, the car may need front end repairs to the alignment, shocks, tires or tie rods. While replacing the tires can be relatively inexpensive, any obvious and significant damage would make the car unsafe to test drive. A new set of tires can be a potential red flag -- as this is an odd expense to pay before selling the car. Make sure you pay specific attention to braking and handling when test driving. Batteries are inexpensive and easy to replace. If the terminals are corroded it is an indication of poor maintenance. Avoid test driving the car if the battery appears too corroded, it could spark or start a fire. Make sure there is no oil on the air filter, or near the air intake. This could indicate blown pistons or other engine damage. If you are unsure of how to check this, have an experienced mechanic show you. Again, a brand new air filter can be a red flag, as it might be a way to cover or postpone engine failure. That said, these cheap parts are easy to replace and should be replaced often, so as long as it's not brand new without an explanation you should be fine. The oil from the dipstick should be black and free from grit. The coolant should not have any particulate matter in it, or be sludgy or brown. This indicates serious issues with the engine that make the car unsafe and costly to repair. If the oil is red or green it is probably brand new. Again, if the seller is not upfront about this it can be a red flag that she/he is hiding bigger issues. It should smell sweet and have little particulate matter.  Burnt orange or brown fluid means it hasn't been changed in a long time. Avoid test driving the car if there are issues with the transmission, as it locking up or otherwise braking could cause an accident. This is for automatic transmissions. For a manual transmission, check the clutch master cylinder for leaks, etc.; and the clutch pedal; it shouldn't feel either too stiff or too loose.  Does the shifter hang up or pop out of gear?  Those would be considered deal enders. Run the heat and the air conditioning to see how well they run. The air conditioning may need coolant to improve cooling.  The fan should blow without any obstruction or excessive noise. . Drive as you normally would, for a period of time that is sensible. This includes freeway and city driving.  Keep an eye on the engine temperature, ease of steering and the ease of shifting gears, as well as the status of check engine light. You can monitor the gear shifts by observing the tachometer's rise and fall with acceleration. Many minor repairs can be accomplished relatively quickly.   Keep the stereo off so that you can listen into the car for dangerous sounds or unwelcome noises. You can test the sound system, but make it quick. Try to drive, if possible, at a variety of speeds and locations. Get on a nearby highway and open it up, then try to slower, more precise turning on slower roads.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'this'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "this", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 21]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 40 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 40}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 1.0, "sft": 0.33333333333333337, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(40, \"more than\")"]}}}

I have always lived my life with the question bearing down like a heavy weight: What do I want? How shall I spend my day? Too much freedom is a heavy burden.    Even though I love to sleep, and in the last month I haven't done all that much of it, I have never felt so free. Maybe it would feel different if there were a man around. I am sleep deprived and I should feel overwhelmed, but I guess I don't have time. I mean, this is the first time I have written since the Blessed Event:     I had just finished my work for Maternity Leave (  3 whole months! )I knew all day I felt different, but honestly thought it might have been the Mexican I'd eaten at lunch. But it was a crazy coincidence that after I went to my neighborhood pool after work, swimming in the slow lane, next to a duck of all things (?) I got out of the pool and felt my water break. Like a cork pulled from a bottle of fizzy champagne. ( People have since asked how I knew. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them \"There is no mistaking a bottle of champagne uncorking between ones legs!\") I got right home, waddling like said Duck from the slow lane. Two slow blocks. I have been living with my Dad and Step-Mother, as you know Diary, and my Dad recalled my Mom's LABORS TO BE FAST, so he ignored my mid-wives reccommendation to call her when the contractions started coming closer together than they were ( 5 minutes, but what did I know? Could be Braxtons I thought. Like the Mexican Food, life can send the wrong message from brain to body, I figured.)     Good thing we listened to the old man, it was 8 hours from start to finish, but it felt like a lot less. Memory blocks pain, I am told, so that's where all those lost minutes that add up to 7 hours went.   By 1:26 A.M. I had a boy. I pushed for an hour, the hour that changed me into a mom more than anything. I now believe I can do anything I have to. And afterwards they handed me this tiny red-headed chicken, and for the first time in my life I knew what it was like to love someone more than myself.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 8th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 8]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Maternity Leave'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Maternity Leave", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.33333333333333337, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 8], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Maternity Leave\", 1, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Maternity Leave\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}}}

Here's a more polished version:\n\nThe task at hand involves refining the text to achieve greater fluency while preserving its original meaning. The output should extend beyond 400 tokens and consist of more than 24 sentences. Each sentence must contain more than five tokens. However, the word 'songs' should remain unchanged throughout this process.\n\nLet's begin by considering the structure of the text. It's important to ensure that each sentence flows smoothly into the next, maintaining coherence and clarity. The content should engage readers while delivering the intended message precisely.\n\nWhen revising, one should pay attention to sentence variety and rhythm. Varying sentence length and structure can enhance the readability of the text. Additionally, using transitional phrases can help connect ideas seamlessly, guiding the reader through the narrative or argument.\n\nConsider the importance of word choice in achieving fluency. Selecting the right words can convey nuances in meaning and evoke the desired emotional response. This is particularly crucial when discussing topics that require sensitivity or convey complex ideas.\n\nWhile maintaining the integrity of the original text, it's essential to eliminate any redundancies or unnecessary repetitions. Conciseness can often improve clarity, ensuring that each word serves a purpose.\n\nFurthermore, the text should be free of grammatical errors, as these can distract readers and undermine the credibility of the content. Attention to detail in punctuation, verb tense consistency, and subject-verb agreement is vital.\n\nWhen incorporating examples or evidence, ensure they are relevant and clearly support the main points. This not only strengthens the argument but also enriches the reader's understanding.\n\nIn narratives or descriptions, vivid imagery can be employed to captivate the reader's imagination. Descriptive language should paint a clear picture, allowing readers to visualize scenes or concepts effortlessly.\n\nDialogue, if included, should sound natural and reflect the way people genuinely communicate. This adds authenticity to characters and situations, making the text more relatable.\n\nThe conclusion of the text should effectively summarize the key points, leaving the reader with a strong impression. It should reinforce the main themes or arguments without introducing new information.\n\nIn summary, the process of refining text involves careful consideration of structure, word choice, and overall coherence. By focusing on these elements, one can enhance the fluency of the text while preserving its original meaning. This process requires attention to detail and a deep understanding of the material, ensuring that the final output meets the specified criteria:\n\nOnce you write some songs that you\u2019re proud of, it\u2019s important to protect them before you start performing or sharing them with the public. As soon as you\u2019ve produced the final written version of your song, you can register your song with the U.S. Copyright Office to ensure that no one else can claim ownership of it. You\u2019ll also need a recorded version of the song. It doesn\u2019t have to be a professional recording from a studio, though. You can use a rough demo version. After you\u2019ve written at least one song that you\u2019re happy with, it\u2019s time to start singing it in front of an audience. Look for open mike nights at clubs, bars, and coffee shops in your area where you can test out your new songs, and gain more experience performing your material in front of a crowd. In addition to open mike nights, keep an eye out for talent shows and music festivals in your area that might allow you to perform your songs. If you want to get more exposure and see how your songwriting compares to other artists\u2019 work, you may want to enter a songwriting contest. Not only may you win money or other prizes that can help fund your singer songwriter career, you may also make contacts in the music industry that can help you advance.  There are a variety of different contests for songwriting, such as the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the International Songwriting Competition. Some may be geared toward specific genres, though, so be sure to find one that\u2019s a good fit for your song(s). Do an online search to find songwriting competitions that you may want to enter. In some cases, you may be better off entering local contests because you won\u2019t be competing against as many other songwriters. Another way to get more visibility as a singer songwriter is to share your music via social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. YouTube is probably the best tool -- create an account and make videos of yourself singing your original songs. Through the other social media apps, you can share them with friends, family, and potential fans, who will hopefully share them with more people so you can create a larger following.  You can also use social media to advertise performances. The more people that you help bring to an open mike night, festival, or other venue, the more of a commodity you\u2019ll seem to booking agents and music industry executives. It\u2019s also a good idea to create a website for yourself and your music. There are a variety of website building sites that make it easy to create a site even if you\u2019re not a computer expert. A fee may be required, though. When TV shows, commercial companies, and other business need music, they often consult online music catalogs. You can submit your songs to these catalogs so companies can listen to your music and see if it\u2019s a fit for what they need. It\u2019s a good way to break into the industry because it will be cheaper to use an aspiring songwriter\u2019s music than to use a successful, popular musician. Some online catalogs charge a fee to list your songs, so be sure to read the fine print to know what you\u2019re in for. Some record companies accept unsolicited demos from aspiring singer songwriters, so you can send them recordings of your songs to see if they\u2019re interested. The best way to identify companies that you should contact is to consider the labels that represent sing songwriters with a similar style to yours. Do an online search for the company, and see what their submission policy is. If you\u2019re going to be sending a demo to a record label, you should have a professional recording of your music. Wait until you have the money to buy studio time and produce a high quality demo before contacting a record company.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 5 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 5}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'songs'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "songs", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.7692307692307693, "sft": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"songs\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21], \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"songs\", 10, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"songs\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(5, \"more than\")"]}}}

Draw up a detailed budget that covers all of your income and expenses and determine what money you have available for your debts. Think about how you can reduce your expenses by making savings and cutting back on non-essentials. If possible, consider how you might also raise your income.  Once you have your budget, you should be able to come up with a realistic and attainable figure that you can set aside each month just for paying off your debts. Join this up to your list of prioritized debts and see how much you can afford to pay. Now you need to contact your creditors to talk about possible ways to restructure and reorganize your debts. If you are able to give them detailed information about how much you are able to pay each month, it may be possible to renegotiate the terms of your loans. For example, you may be able to agree a new repayment plan that reduces the monthly amount you pay, but spreads the payments out over an extended period. It\u2019s important that you are able to reach an agreement with your most troublesome creditors. The others should be easier to pay off once you take care of these creditors and reduce your payments to them. . If you have been unable to negotiate new repayment plans, or all of the information is overwhelming you, be sure to make an appointment with a non-profit credit counseling or debt advice organization. There are number of charities and other non-profits that specialize in giving free and impartial advice to people who find themselves in financial difficulty. Here you will receive advice on what steps to take, and how to deal with creditors.  There is lots of useful information online, but always try to get a face-to-face meeting. Lots of universities, military bases, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extensive service have non-profit credit counseling schemes. Local credit unions, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureaux, and housing authorities may be able to help. Make sure you are visiting a reputable organization with a strong track record. Non-profit doesn\u2019t always mean free. In some cases, a credit counsellor may suggest you enroll in a debt management plan. The counsellor is most likely to suggest this if you are unable to repay your debts. The plans typically involve you paying money to the counseling organization, who then pay it to your various unsecured debts.  Think carefully about this and be sure you have talked it through with your creditors. Only do this if an advisor has looked through your finances thoroughly. In most instances, a counsellor should be able to give you advice on budgeting and managing your debts without resorting to one of these plans. . Debt settlement programs involve working with a company (normally a for-profit company) to pay off principal balances to your creditors, with lump sums that are less than what is owed. Creditors will only do this if they believe it's a better outcome than trying to chase you for payments in the future. The company will make the payment, but you will be required to pay a specific amount of money into a savings account for a long time. This can help pay off your debts, but it can be a risky approach.  If you consider this, be sure you that can make the monthly payments indefinitely. Bear in mind your creditors are under no obligation to come to terms with the debt settlement company. Debt settlement companies generally encourage you to pay them rather than your creditors. As a result, your credit score will suffer and there can be other consequences. If your debts are not being paid you may be incurring extra fees and charges that you wouldn\u2019t if you were paying the creditor directly. There are numerous scams related to debt settlement, and not all companies will live up to their promises. Before you sign-up, do plenty of research on the company and always get free impartial advice for a non-profit credit counseling organization. . You may be able to lower the cost of your debt by consolidating it against a new line of credit, such as by re-mortgaging your home. These plans will generally use your home as collateral, so if your home is not at risk from your debts, think carefully about whether you want to put it on the line.  Be wary of consolidation schemes with variable rates. What might be cheaper to start with can become more expensive if the rate is pushed up. . If your debts are completely unworkable and you cannot find a way forward, it might be time to consider filing for bankruptcy. This is a major decision with long-lasting consequences that should not be taken lightly. Bankruptcy can make it very difficult to access credit or buy a home in the future.  Those filing for bankruptcy can file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler and faster to file and results in the elimination of most debts, but some filers may not qualify for this type of bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy should be considered as a last resort in most cases. In some circumstances, bankruptcy can give a person a fresh start. Talk through your options in detail with a credit counsellor and an attorney specializing in bankruptcy and credit problems before taking any decisions.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 620 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 620}, "function_call": "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 36 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 36}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 37th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 37]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.3636363636363636, "sft": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(36, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(620, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(1, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check(37, \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"debts\", 5, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(620, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(36, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 37], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

If you genuinely do not feel well or believe yourself to be ill, tell your parents and ask to stay home.  Many schools will ask that you stay home if you have an illness or other condition that could be contagious. Staying home allows you to recover and also prevents the spread of disease throughout the school. Generally, you should stay home if you have a fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, trouble swallowing, rash, unusual sores, unusual spots, earache, moderate to severe headache, moderate muscle ache, muscle pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing, red or burning eyes, or head lice.  You might also need to stay home if you are coughing, sneezing, or congested. Stay home until you are free of symptoms without medication for a period of 24 hours, if possible. For instance, if you have recently lost a family member, friend, or another individual who you were close to, your grief is a legitimate reason to stay home from school. Be honest with your parents about how deeply the loss has affected you.  If the tragedy affected you but did not affect your parents, you might worry that they will not understand your grief. Grief is a universal feeling, though, and most people can at least relate to it well enough to allow a grieving person time to work through it. Understand that, by necessity, your initial mourning period will need to have an end. Intense grief might last for a long time, and you might not be able to do anything about it on your own. If you do not feel capable of going to school after a few days to a week, though, you should consider talking to a counselor to help you work through your sorrow. If you are the victim of a bully or group of bullies at school, talk to your parents or legal guardians about it. Explain how difficult school life has become as a result of the bullying and ask to take a day or two off while the issues get sorted out.  Many students make the mistake of keeping quiet about their bullying. You might worry about seeming weak, being labeled a \u201ctattletale,\u201d or making things worse by talking about it. Nothing will ever get better if you do not take steps to put an end to the bullying, and during your adolescent years, getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life is one of the most effective things you can do to get the bullying to stop.  Bullying can have long-term effects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Take care of your future self by speaking up about bullying when it happens. Tell your mom or dad that you\u2019d like a special day with them, and ask them to call in sick from work. This plan might work especially well if you are graduating and moving away to college soon, or if it\u2019s a light work day for you and your parent (e.g., you don\u2019t have any tests or assignments due and your parent doesn\u2019t have a pressing deadline). \u201d It\u2019s important to talk to your parents about stress and anxiety. While adults occasionally forget just how stressful school life can be, the truth is that it really can be tough. If you are dealing with ordinary school-related stress, it might be more beneficial for you to push through. If stress, anxiety, and depression become more serious issues, though, let your parent or legal guardian know and ask for a day off. If you suspect that you might have a serious mental health issue, like depression or an anxiety disorder, ask your parents to schedule an appointment with your doctor, as well. Doing so can emphasize to your parents the severity of your stress, and if you do have an actual disorder, a trip to the doctor can help you get the disorder under control. In the event of a massive blizzard, major flooding, or other circumstances that make traveling to school dangerous, your school system might close for the day, regardless. If the conditions are hazardous and the school does not close, however, consider staying home. Usually, your parent or legal guardian can help determine if conditions are severe enough to justify staying home, so you might not need to do much persuading here. If your parents are staying home from work due to the weather, they will likely be more open to the idea of keeping you home from school, as well. A family vacation or visit from a relative who lives far away might give you a reason to be absent from school, but you should avoid missing school for reasons like this too often. Consider what you might miss if you go to school versus what you might miss if you stay home and work with your parents to decide of staying home is a valid option.  Note that many schools will not accept reasons like these as valid excuses. If this is the case with your school, you will need to let your parents know so that they can tell the school you will be absent without providing a reason. Typically, if you know that you will be home from school ahead of time, your parent or legal guardian should write a note for you to take in a day or two before your planned absence. This will give your teachers time to prepare work for you to take home over your absence.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 20th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 20]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([0, 19], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"1st and 20th sentences.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"fever\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(520, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"sentence\", 1, \"more than\")  # ensure more than 520 tokens", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 20], \"unchange\")"]}}}

They are spread person-to-person by the ingestion of pinworm eggs in that have contaminated fingers, bedding, clothing, and other items. For instance, a child with a pinworm infection may itch his rectum and get eggs on his fingers or under his fingernails, then transmit them to an object or another person, or even re-infect himself. As you can imagine, the more you\u2019re around people that have poor or undeveloped hygiene skills, the greater your risk.   High risk: Children in school/pre-school, people who are institutionalized, and family, household members, and caregivers of the first two groups. Children\u2019s hands go everywhere and usually without a consistent washing. They are also often putting their hands/fingers in their mouth, touching toys, tables, each other, wiping hands on clothes, etc. The same goes for those in institutions. For both of these groups, their environments are a pinworm Petri dish.  Moderate-risk: As you might guess based on those that are high-risk, those that come into contact with any or all of the high-risk individuals are in the moderate risk category. There\u2019s not much you can do other than make sure you follow standard hygiene guidelines. Since you can\u2019t avoid people just because they may have pinworm, all you can do is take care of yourself as best you can.  Low-risk: This is basically everyone else. Adults who have little to no contact with either the high-risk group or fairly limited contact with the moderate-risk group are at a low risk for pinworm infections. After a pinworm egg is digested, there is an incubation period of one to two months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine.  Once mature, the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night, when many of their hosts are asleep. When they lay their eggs, they use \"glue\" that adheres the eggs to the anus and it is this substance that triggers the skin's itching sensation. This is why the itching is usually worse at night: the worms are migrating to the area around the rectum to lay their eggs. Scratching an itch can transfer microscopic pinworm eggs to your fingers. From there, the eggs can be transferred to the mouth or other mucous membranes. This hand-to-mouth transaction can also be accomplished indirectly as well. The eggs can be passed to various surfaces such as a shirt or desk, where they can live for two to three weeks and picked up on the hands of others who, eventually, put unwashed hands to their mouth. In addition to a noticeable irritation in the rectal area, someone can have a pinworm infection without having any symptoms. When symptoms are present, they are likely to be:  Restlessness, poor sleep, especially when this has not been an issue before Bedwetting Irritability (such as teeth-grinding) Vaginal discharge in females Bacterial skin infections If any of these symptoms are occurring, checking for the worms can be done using the naked eye, as follows:  You may be able to see worms in the anal (rectal) area, especially if you look about two or three hours after the infected person has fallen asleep. Use a flashlight (torch) to help you see clearly. You might also see the worms in the toilet after he or she goes to the bathroom. Look to see if the worms are wriggling in bowel movements. The worms are very small, about this long: ___. They may look like little bits of white thread. They may also be found on children's underwear in the morning. If you suspect a pinworm infestation, your doctor may ask you to place a piece of clear, sticky tape against the rectum. Pinworm eggs will stick to the tape.

Prior studies have confirmed that certain neurons within deep neural networks play important roles in learning particular concepts (Oikarinen and Weng, 2022; Bai et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024), preserving factual knowledge (Chen et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2024) as well as solving specific tasks (Stanczak et al., 2022). Beyond enhancing model interpretability, current practical applications of Neuron Analysis include model distillation (Dalvi et al., 2020), knowledge editing (Chavhan et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2023), and *  Figure 1: Neuron analysis in previous language-specific setting of large language model (a) and our domainspecific setting of multimodal large language model (b). controllable generation (Bau et al., 2019; Kojima et al., 2024). Central to such endeavors is the identification of neurons responsible for target scenarios. As illustrated in Figure 1 (a), recent studies have focused on interpreting the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) under the view of language-specific neurons, which are neurons uniquely responsible for particular languages. For instance, Kojima et al. (2024) identified such neurons in pre-trained decoder-based language models, demonstrating that tampering with a few language-specific neurons significantly alters the occurrence probability of target language in text generation. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2024c) detected language-specific neurons by measuring the significance of neurons when processing multilingual inputs and proposed a workflow of LLMs handling multilingual tasks. Moreover, Tang et al. (2024) used language activation probability entropy (LAPE) to identify language-specific neurons, demonstrating that activating or deactivating certain neurons can change the language of the model\u2019s output. On the other hand, it has also been             \fterns for these domains. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage framework based on the distribution of domain-specific neurons among MLLM\u2019s LLM layers, where post-projection visual features are processed by LLM. To validate our hypothesis, we employ logit lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) to decode the hidden states of LLM\u2019s intermediate layers to visualize the feature transformation within transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We identify the presence of domain-specific neurons in representative MLLMs, which is vital for interpreting domain-specific features. \u2022 We analyze the impact of domain-specific neurons, indicating that both LLaVA-NeXT and InstructBLIP do not fully utilize domainspecific information in particular domains. \u2022 We compare features from various domains through the lens of domain-specific neurons, revealing that images from different domains vary in conceptual depth. \u2022 We propose a three-stage framework of language models in MLLMs when processing projected image features, shedding light on the internal mechanisms by which image features align with word embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate domain-specific neurons in the multimodal field, although there are already insightful discussions on visual representations in MLLMs (Schwettmann et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024a). Our findings can reveal the neuron-level similarity and distinction among these domains, offering insights to understand and enhance the cross-domain potential of current MLLMs.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Tang'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Tang", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 43 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 43}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Tang\", \"keep\")"]}}}

Additionally, the total output must exceed 380 tokens:\n\nFine-tuning large language models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks across varying languages, tasks, and domains is a resource-intensive and environmentally harmful process. (Xia et al., 2020). This challenge is especially magnified for low-resource languages (LRLs). However, knowing how well a language model performs on a particular language can be useful information, such as improving the accuracy of quality estimation (QE) models (Zouhar et al., 2023). Therefore, there is a need to estimate the performance of these models for LRLs without conducting time-consuming and computationally expensive model pre-training and fine-tuning. Existing approaches for predicting the performance of models for NLP tasks have shown promise using linear regression and gradientboosting trees (Birch et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2020; Srinivasan et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2021). These studies have considered data size, typological features, and language similarity as factors contributing to the model performance. However, most of these studies are conducted for high-resource languages (HRLs) (e.g., Romance and Germanic families) thus limiting their applicability to LRLs. Furthermore, performance drops in NLP tasks have been observed due to domain shift(Elsahar and Gall\u00e9, 2019). However, this factor is not explicitly considered in the existing works that predict the performance of language models. Based on the aforementioned limitations in the literature, we considered three factors for the Machine Translation (MT) performance prediction for LRLs using classical regression models. These factors are the size of the fine-tuning corpus, the domain similarity between fine-tuning and testing corpora, and the language similarity between source and target languages. Then, we tested the statistical reliability of these regression models and evaluated them based on their prediction accuracy. We selected those with relatively high accuracy for each factor and explored how data partitioning (described in \u00a7 2) affects the quality of fit using these preferred models. Additionally, we analyzed the importance of the factors by ranking them based on their correlation with the MT performance, their weights in multifactor regression models, and their importance in multifactor models using the Random Forest Regressor. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we developed a statistically rigorous method for performance prediction that can be repeated on any combination of LRLs, NLP tasks, and LLMs; 2) we specifically evaluated the impact of various factors on the performance of MT models; 3) we provided domain-specific and language-specific interpretations based on the performance of the regression models. 22 b e F ] L C . s c [ v32.02 : v i X r a", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 15 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 5th, and 13th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [5, 13]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 50 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 50}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.33333333333333337, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.8333333333333333, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"and\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"5th\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"13th\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5, 13], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(50, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

I remember these six months well, because there were a lot of life changes that I had to make and throughout the months I learned more and more about myself than I did last year. Within the last six months, I moved out of my parents' house for the first time; I had a lot of anxiety moving out (especially since I have an anxiety disorder, among other mental illnesses) and the fact that I had to do it suddenly made the anxiety worse. My boyfriend's roommates decided out of the blue that they were going to move out and there was a risk that him and another friend of our would be homeless. Now, at that point in my life I had a part-time job that paid well enough that I could move in and pay rent -- I had expected to movie in with my boyfriend by May when their lease was up but the past roommates decided to move out in February.  Thus, I was not as mentally prepared and had a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that I needed to move out of my parents house eventually. I am 24 years old and struggled with severe depression for a large portion of my life. Some times I feel that I am still struggling but since I had moved that struggle became less and less severe. I have gotten to the point where I have a good handle of my anxiety and depression and try to push past them. This came with the move, as my previous home environment was very hostile: my parents fought and argued all the time. Thinking about it, they have always been fighting since I had remember, and moving out was a right step in the direction to get out of that toxicity. I still struggle with my mental illnesses but they became less and less significant and more manageable than I ever felt before. I knew getting out of a toxic environment was a path to better mental health but I didn't realize how beneficial it was until got out of it. Within the past six months I have lost weight, nearly 10lbs, and have a much more positive head space. Because of this, I was able to eat healthier, stop stress eating, start exercising, being more social, etc. A lot of positive things happened that still affect me significantly to this day. As for my parents... well, I love them very much and it was heartbreaking to see my mother cry when I started packing up and moving out. My mom loved me dearly and she would do anything for me and my brother; however, I needed to leave the nest. I do visit often, I try to keep in touch at least once  or twice a week. Unfortunately I've been doing this less often lately because every time I go there the fighting and arguing continues. I addressed this problem before but my parents didn't quite understand why I was so upset by this. It also didn't help that there was a language barrier and they were born in another country. Since there was no way for me to stop the arguing I had to be the one to leave. It was a hard decision but I'm much happier for it.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\"); word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 5th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [5]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 460 tokens and more than 440 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 460, "min_cnt": 440}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"less than\"); word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333334}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"5th sentence unchanged keyword\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([5], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"eat\", 2, \"less than\")"]}}}

Leading up to the appointment, my mother had been getting quite a lot of uncertain information. She started out with a soreness in her throat, but the initial tests she went through didn't find anything. Then some nodes started to develop on her neck, and she went in for a biopsy to find out what they were. They found thyroid cancer. So, she was called in for further scans (I apologize, but I can't remember exactly what kind now) and the diagnosis quickly escalated from a fairly treatable version present in her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes to a rapidly growing tumor that was threatening her airway. That was when the meeting that I described came in. The scans happened on that Monday, and on Friday we were sitting in a doctors' office with so many specialists there that they couldn't all fit into the room. My father and I went with her to the appointment knowing generally what we were going to hear. We had a little trouble finding the right place to go, but we still got there early. A nurse took some readings first while we waited. Then a doctor came in and started going over the past events with her to make sure that they had everything right. My father and I sat off to the side mostly for moral support but also to take notes and chime in with questions, reminders, or clarifications. There was a knock on the door, and quite a few doctors filed in. They milled about a little trying to find places to stand without crowding anyone. Then they introduced themselves and their specialties explaining how they might be involved in the process ahead. They explained what they had seen and what it meant too. One doctor set up a camera to go into her nasal cavity so they could observe the tumor breaking into her airway in real time. They talked amongst themselves and explained to us what they were seeing. Another doctor did a quick swallow study having my mother do some vocal exercises and swallow water and applesauce to see what would happen. Eventually most of the doctors filed out except the radiologist who introduced herself.

That is, any time the conflict is brought up, you refuse to talk about it. While this is not a productive way to handle all conflicts, you may want to handle certain situations through silence. For instance, if you\u2019re out in public and do not want to start arguing, you can say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place for this discussion. I refuse to talk about it further until we can better engage this.\u201d Whether from a child or from an adult, it never helps to engage a tantrum. Tantrums serve to get attention or to manipulate a situation to go a certain way. Instead of engaging over-the-top behaviors, it's best to ignore them and not allow the behavior to have any emotional anchor on you. If your parent threatens hysterics on account of something you may do in the future, or if your partner threatens drastic behavior if you leave, calmly disengage from the situation. If you feel triggered by someone's words or actions and really want to respond back, this may be a good opportunity to practice silence instead. Especially if this person is egging you on, withhold your statements. If this person keeps pressuring you, you can say, \"I'm doing my best not to say anything that may hurt or offend you, and it's best that I say nothing at all.\" If someone is taunting you or spouting off negative comments to you, don't dignify the words with a response. By not responding, you enact your power of standing for yourself, and of not allowing the comment to affect you. If someone is attacking you or belittling you, there's no sense in defending yourself or reaching that same level of stupidity. It's best to ignore the comments, not let them emotionally affect you, and move on. Arguments can reach the point where rationality flies out the window and you find yourself yelling for no apparent reason. If you notice someone reaching a point of inability to listen to rational statements, there's nothing you can say to respond well. Instead of intensifying the situation, take a step back and say nothing.  You may try to explain things or make a defense for your actions. Many times it's best to say nothing and move on. When in an intense argument, it can be beneficial to shift your attention to fully listening to the other person. The other person will see that you are attentive and being heard, and may begin to calm down.  Monitor your own emotions and keep from saying things out of anger. If you really are too mad or can't deal with your emotions, tell the person you want to step away for a bit. That way, you're not ignoring, but you'll have time to get yourself under control. As an example, you could say, \"I really want to talk about this situation with you. However, my emotions are running really high right now. Can we come back and talk about this in an hour when I feel more calm?\" It's easy to get caught up in emotions when you feel accused of something or that you're being unfairly treated. You may need your own calming during an argument. Retreating to silence may be a way for you to calm down, clear your head, and begin thinking from a more rational state of mind.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'best'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "best", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 11th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [11]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 31 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666665, "base": 0.6, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check(11, \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"best\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([11], \"unchange\")"]}}}

These packages are much more expensive than the basic ticket price and they usually sell out early, but they will give you an opportunity to go backstage and meet the band. This option is good if you don\u2019t really like the idea of sneaking backstage and you can afford to buy the VIP package. The earlier that you show up to the concert venue, the better your chances of getting backstage will be. Lots of people try to get backstage at concerts and as the evening progresses, security guards become more cautious and selective of who they allow backstage. If you show up early, you will have a better chance. Since they are the ones blocking your entrance to the backstage, you will have a better chance of reaching your goal if you are nice to them. Don\u2019t overdo it. Just be pleasant and polite. Make casual conversation with the security guards and try not to act like you are dying to get backstage, even if you really are! If you notice a roadie lugging some equipment onto the stage and ask if you can help. If you are allowed to help, work really hard and thank the roadies for letting you help. This strategy may get you backstage and it can also land you an awesome on-stage vantage point during the concert. You are less likely to get backstage with a group of three or more friends, but if its just you or just you and a pal then security will be less likely to bother with you. Trying to sneak backstage at a concert is risky because you can get kicked out of you are caught. If you do get caught sneaking backstage, don\u2019t get angry or try to run away. Just be pleasant and apologetic if you get caught and you will have a better chance of not getting kicked out. Although you may be freaking out inside, you will need to act casual if you manage to get backstage. If you seem way too excited, security will notice and they might kick you out. Instead, take a deep breath and enjoy your time backstage. Stay calm if you bump into your idol while you are cruising around backstage. It's okay to act a little excited as long as you avoid gushing too much. If you have something that you were hoping to get signed, ask politely if he or she would mind signing it for you. If you want to pay your idol a compliment, go for it! Just remember to keep it simple and things are less likely to get awkward. Try something like: \"I've been a fan for years. Thank you for creating such awesome music!\"Talking with your idol in the laid back manner is also less likely to catch the attention of security, which will increase your odds of getting to stay backstage.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'years'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "years", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 14th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [14]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 340 tokens and more than 320 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 340, "min_cnt": 320}, "function_call": "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 1.0, "gpt4o": 1.0, "base": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 0.6153846153846153, "simpo_iter2": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter3": 0.7692307692307692}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(14, \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "keyword_frequency_check(\"years\", 1, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"years\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"]}}}

Some of those tutorial sites are listed below. Many offer all their tutorials for free, some offer some tutorials free and charge for others, while still others charge for most of their content:   YouTube. If you type in the topic you want to learn in YouTube's search engine, you'll find a variety of tutorials available.  Good Tutorials. A free site.  Kelby One. Kelby One charges for most of its tutorials, but you can preview the subject matter being taught in a given tutorial before you pay for it. Most of its classes deal with using Photoshop to enhance digital photographs.  Lifehacker. This how-to website includes a page described as a complete guide to Photoshop.   PhLearn. This tutorial site focuses primarily on the photographic effects you can produce in Photoshop. It is the brainchild of Aaron Nace, a respected name among photographers.  Photoshop Caf\u00e9.

Although each video is focused more on entertainment than educational content, you can still learn quite a bit about Photoshop from watching a number of episodes \u2013 and laugh at your mistakes in the process. Many colleges and universities, particularly community colleges, offer online classes in a number of subjects, including Photoshop. There are also a number of online-based institutions that offer online Photoshop classes and tutorials. Some resemble classes; some resemble educational television classes.  Lynda.com offers around 300 Photoshop courses and more than 17,000 tutorials. It charges a monthly subscription fee for its classes. Like Kelby One, you can get an overview of a course\u2019s content before you pay for it. Creative Live offers popular instructors and displays both a catalog of previous classes and announcements of upcoming ones. They also devote one week a year to Photoshop classes. Unlike Lynda, Creative Live\u2019s classes are free. Photoshop User TV is backed by the same people who back the Kelby One tutorial site. You can search through the list of classes to find the one that addresses the aspect of Photoshop you wish to learn more about. If you like being able to ask questions to a human being and have the time to attending, Photoshop classes are available through your local community college or private training institution. You can also sign up through organizations like Ledet, who arrange for instructors to visit your city when they receive sufficient demand. If you don\u2019t have reliable Internet access or ready access to classroom instruction, you can find instructional DVDs on Photoshop, particularly if you want to learn more about retouching digital photographs with it. The Digital Photoshop Retouching series on DVD includes instructions from experts such as Julia Kuzmenko and Krunoslav Stifter. While the above options are primarily devoted to demonstrative and hands-on learning, if you enjoy learning from a book, you can do so for Photoshop.

You may be not even need more than one incident, depending on the severity, before you can take action.  Incidents severe enough to warrant repercussions on their own include any physical abuse or intimidation, or verbal abuse that is blatantly racist or sexist. Smaller incidents may add up to a pattern of bullying or harassment. For example, a coworker may constantly make comments about how stupid you are, or how you are the reason sales are down. They may imply that you aren't qualified for your job, and that you only got your position because of your race or your gender. In your log, write down the date, time, and location of each occurrence. Then provide a brief, factual description of the events that occurred. Include as many specific details as possible \u2013 you may not remember them later, and your log can help refresh your recollection. Legally, behavior must be \"unwelcome\" to be subject to any penalty. In some instances, it may be obvious that no one would welcome the behavior. In others, you may need to make it clear that you do not consent to the harassment or attention.  If a coworker is sexually harassing you by constantly hitting on you, simply ignoring them won't make the problem go away and may not communicate the message to them. As long as you say nothing, they can argue that they thought you enjoyed the attention. For example, suppose a coworker continually leaves notes and small presents on your desk, and comments on your clothing each day. You might say \"I'm not interested in any relationship with you outside of work, and your persistence won't change that.This kind of attention is unwelcome and makes me feel uncomfortable.\" It may be a good idea to put this communication in writing, just so you have a record of telling the person that their behavior is unwelcome. Send them an email through the company email system, and blind-copy a coworker or supervisor. If someone is bullying you in the workplace, there are likely coworkers who have been in the same room or nearby and seen the behavior. You may even find out that the person has also been bullying others in the workplace.  If a coworker witnessed an actual incident of bullying, ask them if they would be willing to go on the record with their story to support or corroborate yours. If witnesses tell you about others who have been bullied by the same person, talk to them to find out how they were treated and what happened as a result. Often people who resort to bullying tactics in the workplace have a pattern of treating multiple people the same way. If the person who is bullying or harassing you sends you any emails, or leaves things in your workspace, take care to preserve them as evidence. Physical evidence is extremely valuable because so many of these disputes come down to one person's word against the other's. This is especially important if the person who is bullying or harassing you is a supervisor, or has worked for the company longer than you have and has a generally good reputation. Your description of the incidents that took place, as well as any physical evidence you're trying to be preserved, should be kept in a place that only you can access. This prevents it from being tampered with or destroyed. Ideally, you want to keep copies of everything outside the workplace.

Both my parents and siblings were so worried because she had been suffering with her illness for a while now. she looked so tired and she was complaining of having so much pain on reaching at the hospital the doctors told us that she was in a critical condition and she had to be rushed to the emergency room. We waited for the doctor for almost 30 minutes without hearing nothing from the doctors,everybody was getting very anxious because we didn't know what was happening to our little girl. My mother was walking all over talking to all the nurses trying to find out what was going on with her doctor. After an hour the doctor that was taking care of my sister came out and his face looked a bit worried just looking at him my mother started crying because she thought something bad had happened to her little girl. The doctor came over and told us that he was very sorry because she was dead. i felt like the world was coming to an end all i could see is darkness all over the room i don't remember what happened next i only woke up to find myself in a hospital bed that's when i remembered that my little sister was no more. i immediately started screaming and asked my mother why did this have to happen to her when she was only eight years old my mother couldn't say anything she was just seated besides me weeping uncontrollably. she was my best friend my confident someone i could turn to whenever i had a problem now she was no more. my dad came into the room and told me to take heart because everything happened for a reason and i should thank God because she had been suffering for a while now with the sickness. i got out of bed and demanded to be taken to my sister so that i could see her body. she was lying there so innocent it was very painful watching her sleeping so lifeless. It was like the world was coming to an end. loosing her was very painful and i always think of her. i loved her so much until now i miss her so much", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 8th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [8]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_full_length": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the eighth sentence unchanged\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check(8, \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"she was lying there so innocent it was very painful watching her sleeping so lifeless.\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"eighth\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"she looked so tired\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"eighth\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"she was lying there so innocent it was very painful watching her sleeping so lifeless.\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([8], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"]}}}

This may offer you some immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that is exacerbating your discomfort.  Keep the pack on the affected area for at least 20 minutes per session. Doing it for any less time may only cool your skin and not have any affect on your underlying muscle tissue.  You can ice your back up to five times a day with at least 45 minutes in between treatments.  If you are having a hard time keeping the pack on your back, try keeping it in place with a towel or some elastic wrap. Using heat on tense muscles not only can help relieve your pain, but may also relax your muscles. From heating pads to heat rubs, there are many different types of heat treatments that can help relieve your back pain while sitting at work.  Fill a hot water bottle or get a heating pad and place it on your chair on the affected area. Over the counter heat rubs may also help alleviate pain. Try taking an over the counter pain reliever. It may relieve your pain and also help control inflammation.  Take ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium, which are called NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), to help relieve your back pain. You can also try taking acetaminophen.  Ibuprofen and NSAIDs may also help relieve inflammation.  Consider combining your ice pack with a pain reliever while you\u2019re at work to get maximum pain relieving benefits. If pain relievers aren\u2019t alleviating your pain, consider taking a muscle relaxant. Your doctor will need to prescribe a muscle relaxant, so make sure you speak to her about why you need them. Be aware that muscle relaxants can make you dizzy and sleepy, and may affect your performance at work. Massaging the area of your back causing you pain may help relax you and relieve any discomfort you have. You don\u2019t need to do anything in-depth or complicated to reap the benefits of massaging your back.  Gently rub any area causing you discomfort if you can reach it. Consider using a tennis ball to help relieve your pain. You can place the ball between your back and a wall or your chair and gently move back and forth to give yourself a massage. Stimulating acupressure points on your back may to help relieve pain. There are four points on the lower back that are associated with alleviating back pain.  The acupressure point for back pain are located near the spine at about waist level and between the second and third lumbar vertebrae.  Gently press on these points to help relieve your pain. You can find the exact spots which to stimulate at http://acupressurepointsguide.com/most-important-acupressure-points-for-back-pain/ Although it\u2019s important to get up every hour to keep your back mobile, you can also perform low back stretches while sitting.  Sit with your feet flat. Reach over to the right and place both your hands on the arm rest. Slowly pull your body to the same side, rotating until you feel a relaxing stretch. Hold this position for at least 30 seconds. Repeat again two to three more times. Then repeat to the other side. The hamstring muscles can get tight while sitting.

The output should have fewer than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens, with each sentence containing more than 11 tokens. Additionally, the output should consist of fewer than 20 sentences:\n\nLet's say you're working with the following equation: 3x2 - 4x + 5. To factor out a three from the first two terms, simply pull out a 3 and place it around a set of parenthesis around both terms, while dividing each term by 3. 3x2 divided by 3 is simply x2 and 4x divided by 3 is 4/3x. So, the new equation should look like this: 3(x2 - 4/3x) + 5. The 5 will remain outside of the equation because you did not divide it by 3. The second term, also known as the b term in the equation, is 4/3. Halve the second term, or divide it by 2 first. 4/3 \u00f7 2, or 4/3 x 1/2, is equal to 2/3. Now, square this term by squaring both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. (2/3)2 = 4/9. Write this term down. You'll need this \"extra\" term to turn the first three terms in this equation into a perfect square. But you have to remember that you added it by subtracting it from the equation as well. Though obviously, it won't do you much good to simply combine the terms -- you'll be back where you started. The new equation should look like this: 3( x2 - 4/3 x + 4/9 - 4/9) + 5. Since you're working with a coefficient of 3 outside the parentheses, you can't just pull out the -4/9. You'll have to multiply it by 3 first. -4/9 x 3 = -12/9, or -4/3. If you're not working with an equation with a coefficient other than 1 over the x2 term, then you could skip this step. Right now, you're left with 3(x2 -4/3x +4/9) within the parentheses. You worked backwards to get the 4/9, which was really another way of finding the term that would complete the square. So, you can rewrite those terms like this: 3(x - 2/3)2. All you had to do was halve the second term and remove the third. You can check that this works by multiplying it out to see that it gives you the first three terms of the equation.  3(x - 2/3)2 = 3(x - 2/3)(x -2/3) = 3[(x2 -2/3x -2/3x + 4/9)] 3(x2 - 4/3x + 4/9) You're left with two constant terms, or terms that aren't attached to a variable. Right now, you're left with 3(x - 2/3)2 - 4/3 + 5. All you have to do is add up -4/3 and 5 to get 11/3. You do this by setting them to the same denominator: -4/3 and 15/3, and then adding the numerators to get 11, and keeping the denominator as 3. -4/3 + 15/3 = 11/3. You're all done. The final equation is 3(x - 2/3)2 + 11/3. You can remove the coefficient of 3 by dividing both parts of the equation to get (x - 2/3)2 + 11/9.  You have now successfully placed the equation into vertex form, which is a( x - h )2 + k, where k represents the constant term.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'three'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "three", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 360, "min_cnt": 340}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 11 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 11}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "base": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(11, \"more than\")"]}}}

It's often preferable to do well in a challenging program than to be exceptional in an average one. If your school offers advanced courses, especially those for which college credit is offered, an Ivy League school will expect you to have taken them. An example would be that working for an A in AP Physics is preferable to a straight 100 average in regular Physics.  Schools can't factor difficult teachers into their decision. They can only go off your transcript. Look for classes that will be recognized as difficult, but preferably without overly difficult grading. It's most helpful to take difficult classes and work hard in subjects you expect to continue with in college, because they'll also make good grades there easier. Aim to be a well-rounded achiever. A slacker who decides to start making good grades late in high school probably won't be admitted.  You should have a consistent history of high scholastic achievement. There are sometimes exceptions as colleges also love to see improvement. If your problems were due to circumstances beyond your control, you could attach a supplement to your application about what they were and how you succeeded in spite of them. Having a GPA in the top 5-10% of your class is essential, and being ranked among the top few students dramatically betters your chances. Keep in mind you're applying to institutions where many of the other applicants are valedictorians at their school. This is a critical part of your overall application because it's the one area where you're on equal footing with everyone else. Aim for attaining at least a 700 (out of a possible 800) points on each section of the SAT (and on individual SAT II tests), or a composite of 30 on the ACT for a reasonable chance of being admitted. Bringing these scores up to 750+ on each SAT section (meaning at least 2250 out of 2400 points in total), or a 33+ composite ACT, will give you solid scores that need not be improved.  Do not repeat the test more than three times. According to Chuck Hughes, a former senior admissions officer at Harvard, the admission panel will notice this and your repeated attempts to get a high score may come off as too focused on scores.  Get good before you take it. Take a test-preparation class or get a few books and practice. Speed and accuracy on these tests is a unique skill which needs to be learned.  Start preparing early and keep at it diligently until you can solve the problems without much thinking. Ivy Leagues want to see a well-rounded applicant who didn't lock themselves away for four years to get good grades. Join a sports team (even if it's just an intramural team), join a club or two and get involved with the theater department. Think on a national or international scale; don't just limit yourself to the opportunities in your hometown.  Spending a summer helping raise funds to build a school in Peru will mean more to them than raising funds for your local church. in the areas where you excel. Look for opportunities to take on additional recognition and responsibility as a leader. This can range from becoming class president to cheerleading captain, or even an officer for a club you participate in.

But the essentials for a good kitchen can get you through 90% of all recipes. While you should expand your tools as you get better and better, you should, at least, start with:  Skillets (1 large, 1 small) Saucepots (1 5-gallon, 1 1-gallon, or rough equivalents Roasting pan Casserole Dish Dutch Oven (optional, but highly recommended) Metal mixing bowl(s) Knife set (minimum -- chef's knife, paring knife, serrated knife) Cutting boards (at least 2 -- one for meat and one for other) Dry and wet measuring cups/spoons Metal tongs. Mixing Utensils (whisk, wooden spoon, slotted spoon, ladle, spatula) You'll spend more time on your knife than any other tool, and it pays to use it well. Good knife skills don't only make your more efficient, they make your food taste better. Evenly cut vegetables cook evenly, avoiding the bias of meats and onions makes for more tender food, and proper technique saves you from dulled blades and hours of cutting. Some tips for professional knife work include:  Grip the knife with your thumb and curled index finger where the blade meets the handle. You want the back of your hand pointing up, not to the side, for the best control. If the blade is curved, cut forward and back, not up and down. You want to slide the knife through the food so that the curve of the blade slides along the cutting board. Sharpen your knives every few months. Get the professionally sharpened once or twice a year. Dull blades can slip and cut you, and make cooking much less fun. Everything that you can safely prep ahead of time should be prepped ahead of time. Good cooks are excellent time managers, utilizing every second in the kitchen efficiently so they aren't running around with their heads cut off or leaving things accidentally on the stove.  Chop your veggies. Measure out ingredients into cups or bowls. Clean workspaces before cooking, not during. Get all needed tools and items out of storage and in the kitchen. Do each stage all at once. Don't skin an onion, then cut it, then skin another, then cut it. Skin all the onions at once, then cut all the onions at once. . Good meal planning helps you get the most out of your shopping, re-using ingredients and minimizing waste. Write out a little calendar and plan out meals for the next 2-3 days to start, looking up recipes with some ingredient overlap for the best results  Keep a list of your favorite meals and recipes to make future meal planning easier. Looking up recipes in advance will also help you see how different ingredients can be used different ways, expanding your cooking vocabulary. This makes it lots easier than a big cleanup. More importantly, it keeps your workspaces clean and clutter-free, allowing you to keep cooking or working on new dishes with ease.  Anytime you handle raw meat or fish, wash down all surfaces and utensils used. Get in a habit of cleaning during downtime (sauteeing, waiting for a loaf to proof, etc.). Good cooks hit the trashcan and/or compost bin a lot, trimming bits of food and unwrapping or opening ingredients. You'll be faster and more hygienic if you just keep a trash receptacle right on hand. Your shrimp are going to burn if you have to run around looking for the sea salt, onions and potatoes will lose flavor and texture if stored wrong, and leftovers will all go to waste if you don't keep the fridge in some semblance of order. There is a reason most professional kitchens are run with army-like precision. While you don't need to go so far as labeling everything you own, an organized kitchen allows all of your energy to go into the food, not finding it.   Give yourself ample space, using the biggest cutting boards you can fit. Keep everything grouped -- spices, vegetables, cooking oils, etc. -- so they are easy to find.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'knife'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "knife", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 94 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 94}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 26 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 1.0, "simpo_iter4": 1.0, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "base": 0.33333333333333337}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"knife\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(94, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()"]}}}

Here are a few basics that all sexually active people should know about pregnancy:  Pregnancy can occur anytime that semen enters the vagina. Almost all pregnancies result from unprotected penetrative sex, with the penis in the vagina. Pregnancy is extremely unlikely during oral sex, anal sex, or non-penetrative sexual activities.  Precum (a fluid the penis releases in small amounts when aroused) typically does not contain viable sperm. Unlike semen, precum is unlikely to cause pregnancy. All types of unprotected vaginal, oral, and anal sex can spread sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You can only get an STD by sharing fluids with someone already infected. However, many people have an STD that does not cause visible symptoms, and this can still be transferred during sex and cause major health problems (such as female infertility). The Center for Disease Control recommends annual STD testing for sexually active women under 25, and for men who have sex with men. Men who do not have sex with men are at lower risk, but should still be tested after risky sexual behavior.  Some STDs can take six months or longer to show up on a test. If you and your sexual partner only have sex with each other, you only need to be tested once. Get tested again if you suspect your partner has had sex with someone else, or if either of you have used injected drugs with a shared needle. Condoms are the most common method of birth control among teens. They are cheap, easy to use, and protect you from both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Make sure you are using them correctly. Male condoms reduce pregnancy chance to 2% per year when used perfectly, but during typical use, mistakes or lapses increases this to 18%.  Female condoms are slightly less effective, reducing the chance to 5% when used correctly. Do not use a female and male condom at the same time.  Using condoms and one of the methods below is an excellent way to protect yourself and your sexual partner. Birth control pills are very effective at preventing pregnancy when a woman takes one every day. They do not protect against STDs. \"The pill\" is available over the counter in many countries. In the U.S., you need a doctor's prescription.  U.S. law prevents your doctor from telling your parents about your birth control. However, they may find out if you pay for it using your parent's health insurance. Birth control typically costs $15\u2013$50 per month, so you and your sexual partner may be able to pay for it yourselves.  These pills are very safe for most women, but may cause health issues if you have serious health issues related to your heart or blood. Smoking increases this risk. Birth control pills make your menstrual cycle more regular and may reduce unpleasant side effects, such as acne and cramping. Women are most fertile during ovulation and for a few days afterward. This usually happens on days 11\u201321 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, where day 1 is the start of menstrual flow. It's important to realize that most women do not have regular cycles, so you can't predict exactly when this happens in advance. This tells you when pregnancy is especially risky, but you shouldn't skip protection at other times of the month.  Sperm can survive for a few days in the vagina, so sex before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy. To track this, keep a menstrual cycle calendar with signs of an approaching period. If you want to be extra safe, track your ovulation. There are many other forms of birth control available, from diaphragms to intrauterine devices. For more information, visit a reproductive health center such as Planned Parenthood, or talk to a doctor or gynecologist. Teens are exposed to many myths about birth control and STDs, so don't assume everything you've heard is true. The withdrawal method, where the man pulls out before ejaculation, is not recommended by most experts. While it does reduce pregnancy somewhat when followed correctly, there is a risk the man will not pull out in time, or change his mind after sex has started.

In most cases, women only discover the problem when they struggle to get pregnant. From a medical perspective, \u201cinfertility\u201d means that you are not pregnant after at least one year of regular, unprotected sex. If this happens to you, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible.  If you are over 35 years old, don't have regular menses, or have tested for ovulation and tests are negative, don\u2019t wait a year. Schedule an appointment after six months of regular, unprotected sex.  Note that \u201cinfertility\u201d is not the same as \u201csterility.\u201d If you are infertile, you may still be able to conceive a child, with or without medical help. Do not assume that you will never be able to get pregnant. Your doctor will probably recommend a complete fertility evaluation for both you and your partner. Your partner will need to provide a sperm sample so that a specialist can rule out a problem with sperm count or motility. You will likely need various tests to confirm that you have normal hormone levels and are ovulating properly. If all of these tests come back normal, then your doctor will recommend checking your fallopian tubes. Your doctor may recommend undergoing a sonohysterogram \u2013 a medical procedure that involves using an ultrasound to look for masses in the uterus. Your uterus will first be injected with saline water so that the doctor can see better during the ultrasound. Uterine masses can sometimes block the fallopian tubes. Fibroids, polyps or other masses near the fallopian tubes could cause the blockage. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a medical procedure in which a special dye is injected through your cervix and into your fallopian tubes. X-rays are then taken to determine if the tubes are open or blocked.  Hysterosalpingograms are done without anesthesia, and you should experience only mild cramping or discomfort. It can help, however, to take ibuprofen about an hour beforehand. This procedure usually takes 15 to 30 minutes.  Potential risks include pelvic infection or damage to cells or tissue from radiation exposure. If your doctor suspects that your tubes are blocked, they may use an oil-based dye during the procedure.  The oil can sometimes remove the blockage. Depending on the results of your sonohysterogram and hysterosalpingogram, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopy \u2014 a medical procedure in which an incision in made near your navel to find (and, in certain cases, remove) any tissue that is blocking the tubes. In general, laparoscopy should only be performed after other infertility testing has been done. This is partly because it is a riskier procedure: it\u2019s done under general anesthesia, so it carries all of the risks associated with any major surgery. The results of these tests should determine whether one or both of your fallopian tubes are blocked. Ask your doctor to explain the extent of the blockage. Having as specific a diagnosis as possible will help to determine a treatment plan.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'fallopian'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "fallopian", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter4": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "base": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"fallopian\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"]}}}

Security handles registration of vehicles and it is a free service. There was another vehicle in the parking lot. It was an older motorhome. It had 5 to 7 barking dogs in it and a pile of garbage behind it that was 6 feet high. There were two adults in it that seemed to argue with each other all the time. Behind the pile of garbage was a trail that led to a creek and garbage was scattered all along the trail. There were many large bear tracks, these people had a bear baiting station right in the parking lot. We went to register our trailer and get settled in. Once we find the security office they yell at us because we did not have the registration to our trailer with us. We had called them twice earlier in the month and they had never mentioned that we would need anything. They just said just find a place to park and come talk to us. Since I had a pre-op doctor appointment I had to leave and let my husband take care of the registration. While I was at the doctor's office, my husband text me that they had called the police and they were going to have him arrested for trying to park a stolen trailer.  Twenty minutes later he text me that he and the police had it all straightened out and he was able to prove it was our trailer and not stolen. My husband was headed to the trailer with the appropriate placards for the trailer and was going to finally get settled in. Then we needed to report the garbage and bear baiting area. So my husband went back to talk to security and they said they would take care of it. But no one came.  So after no one showed up for two days the police happened to be talking to an upset person in the area.

I had awoken early, had breakfast at the motel and then drove downtown to visit an art museum I had been planning to see. I arrived early and was one of the first ones to enter. I noticed five other people waiting, two couples, one in their 50s the other couple younger, perhaps in thier 30s. There was also an older woman, she looked like she could be in her 80s. She wore a coat although it wasn't that cold out and walked with a distinctive wooden cane. The two couple went in as soon as the doors were unlocked and I held the door for the older woman to enter. The museum had a special showing of photographs from famous artist in Canada. I took my time walking through and viewing the work. On the third floor I noticed the old woman standing in front of two photographs by a woman photographer (I'll leave her name out) and I smiled at her as I passed behind the old woman and glanced at the photographers name and saw there were two photos of her work. I continued on and then went to the basement cafe for some coffee and a pastry. I was there about 30 minutes. I decided to walk through the museum again. On the third floor I noticed the old woman still standing in the same place. I approached her and after making eye contact, I ask her if she was OK?\"Oh yes, quite,\" she said, \"I'm just admiring my granddaughter's photographs.\"\"Oh, this photograph is your granddaughter?\" I asked.\"She was,\" said the old woman, \"but I'm afraid she died three years ago, an accident, she was 37.\"I told her how terribly sorry I was and then she told me she's lived in that town, but her granddaughter worked in Montreal,  so she only saw her every few years. But now she had come for eight days in a row and would continue to come into the work was moved to another city as it made her feel closer to her granddaughter than she had ever been. i complimented the work and invited the old woman down to the cafe for coffee. She talked to me for an hour about her life, but mostly of her daughter (who also had died) and her granddaughter.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'through'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "through", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 28 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter4": 1.0, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 1.0, "base": 0.9090909090909091}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"through\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")"]}}}

The output should contain between 360 and 380 tokens:\n\nWe were coming home from a party with a couple of girls who typically hang out with us after-hours. My roommates Pete, Jim and Bob (who we all call Lude) had gone with me to a party at my friend Lisa's house. At the party, we met up with Ann and Chris, two girls who hang out with us a lot. Ann and I used to be romantically involved a few months ago, but we're just friends now. Chris and Pete have had an on-again, off-again relationship. When we got back to the house, my roommate John, who had not attended the party with the rest of us, was there drinking beer with several of his friends that I didn't really know. One of John's friends seemed to take a liking to Chris and was chatting her up outside on the patio.  She seemed interested in him. Pete noticed the interaction and started drinking a lot of bourbon, perhaps because he had hoped to have sex with Chris that night and saw that he had competition. As the night wore on, we all had become pretty drunk, especially Pete. The first guy who had been hitting on Chris ended up leaving with her. Pete had been distracted with something else and didn't notice until they had been gone for several minutes. When he figured out that Chris had left with another guy, Pete went kinda crazy. He started blaming our roommate John for bringing those strange guys to the house. Pete started yelling right in John's face, and John got very agitated. A fight between Pete and John seemed likely to break out, but a second and third guy that we didn't really know, walked up and settled the situation down by separating Pete and John. However, a fourth guy was disappointed that Pete and John had decided not to fight. He tried to agitate them into fighting by saying some really insulting obnoxious things about Chris and Ann, but a fifth and sixth guy came in a tried to shut up the fourth guy. The fourth guy and the sixth guy, who seemed to known each other fairly well, took exception to each other, and the sixth guy got really angry.

Keep the word 'June' unchanged:\n\nMy friends Sarah and William have never been to the United States.  When William had the opportunity to interview at the Chicago branch of his firm he was able to work in a visit to us in Grand Haven Michigan.  One of the first places we spent the day was the beach at Grand Haven.  We haven't seen in each other in person for such a long time that we spent half the day just talking at picnic table in the shade while watching the windsurfers play.  My partner Jamie knew of a little place we could get great sandwiches and picked them up for everyone as we scouted out a place on the beach to set up for the day.  Even though the beach was busy it was very relaxing.     If you've never been to a winery I can tell you that Traverse City has some fabulous locations to visit.  This was on Sarah's wish list and we were more than happy to take them up North to experience everything the near upper peninsula had to offer.  We left in the late afternoon to check into our hotel to visit the wineries early the next day when they opened.  On the drive there we took a detour to stop at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  William is a hobby photographer and really wanted to see a sunset from this vantage point.  It was a trek to the best location but it was amazingly worth it.  I think we were all ready to a good nights rest after the travel and hiking that day.  The wineries the next day were equally amazing and we learned a lot about the wines are made.  At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.  They have some amazing restaurants in TC so after we had a couple hours to recover we took them to out favorite spot in town.  It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.      With only a few days of their trip left we took them up to Mackinaw Island for a day trip to experience what it's like to ride in a horse drawn carriage, and to ride on bikes to get where you need to go.  We had so much visiting all of the charming shops and taking in the scenery.  We were fortunate we had gorgeous weather that wasn't too hot for June.       We had such an amazing time visiting with out Irish friends that we're already talking about finding away to visit them in Ireland before they potentially end up moving to the states.    We're fortunate they were able to visit us in the summer when our state really shines!

Current studies on LLMs, such as GPT-series (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), PaLM-series (Chowdhery et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), have shown impressive zero-shot performance. In addition, LLMs also bring some emergent abilities including instruction following (Wei et al., 2022a), chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022c) and in-context learning (Min et al., 2022), which attract increasing attention (Wei et al., 2022b). Figure 1: The example of applying LLMs for NLP tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning, machine translation, information extraction and sentiment analysis). With the advancement of large language models, as shown in Figure 1, LLMs allow various natural language processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., zero-shot mathematical reasoning, text summarization, machine translation, information extraction and sentiment analysis) to be achieved through a unified generative paradigm, which has achieved remarkable success (Wei et al., 2022c, 2023a; Qin et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023a,d,h,j; Wan et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a). Additionally, some LLMs in NLP work without needing any additional training data and can even surpass traditional models fine-tuned with supervised learning. This advancement significantly contributes to the development of NLP literature. As a result, the community has witnessed an exponential growth of LLMs for NLP studies, which motivates us to investigate the following questions: (1) How are LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature? (2) Have traditional NLP tasks already been solved with LLMs? (3) What is the future of the LLMs for NLP? To answer the above questions, we make the first attempt to present a comprehensive and detailed analysis on LLMs for NLP.

To this end, in this paper, we first introduce the relevant background and preliminary. Furthermore, we introduce a unified paradigm on LLMs for NLP: (1) parameter-frozen application including (i) zero-shot learning and (ii) few-shot learning; (2) parameter-tuning application containing (i) full-parameter tuning and (ii) parameter-efficient tuning, aiming to provide a unified perspective to understand the current progress of LLMs for NLP: \u2022 Parameter-frozen application directly applies prompting approach on LLM for NLP tasks without the need for parameter tuning. This category includes zero-shot and few-shot learning, depending on whether the few-shot demonstrations is required. \u2022 Parameter-tuning application refers to the need for tuning parameters of LLMs for NLP tasks. This category includes both fullparameter and parameter-efficient tuning, depending on whether fine-tuning is required for all model parameters. Finally, we conclude by identifying potential frontier areas for future research, along with the associated challenges to stimulate further exploration. In summary, this work offers the following con(LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. (2) New taxonomy: We introduce a new taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen application and (2) parameter-tuning application, which provides a unified view to understand LLMs for NLP tasks. (3) New frontiers: We discuss emerging areas of research in LLMs for NLP and highlight the challenges associated with them, aiming to inspire future breakthroughs.

A central element to this online interaction is the product description, which significantly influences search visibility and customer engagement (Bijmolt et al., 2018). Historically, the creation of effective product descriptions has been a manual, labor-intensive process with a tendency to lack both consistency and scalability (Zhu et al., 2019). Moreover, novel products often face the \u2019cold start\u2019 problem, where they lack sufficient engagement data to be adequately featured or recommended by eCommerce platforms (Wang et al., 2020). Effective product descriptions have the potential to mitigate this issue by aligning with current market trends, thereby enhancing clickthrough rates (Cakmak et al., 2019). To address the existing challenges in eCommerce, this paper introduces an innovative methodology that employs the LLAMA 2.0 7B language model to automate the generation of product descriptions (Touvron et al., 2023). We begin by training the model on a carefully curated dataset of authentic product descriptions from Walmart, a global leader in the eCommerce arena (Zhou and Agichtein, 2020). During the initial training phase, we identify items with high recent clickthrough rates and use their product descriptions as positive training samples. Conversely, items with lower engagement rates are used as negative training samples. For the fine-tuning process, we focus on five specific aspects of the product description: language appeal, factual information, product dimensions, unique attributes, and brand-related guarantees. The fine-tuned model aims to incorporate language that captures consumer interest while providing essential information for informed product selection (Zhou et al., 2020). This nuanced approach significantly enhances the model\u2019s ability to boost both sales and customer engagement (Bijmolt et al., 2018). In the second phase of our methodology, we target items that have lackluster product descriptions for enrichment. Utilizing the fine-tuned model, we augment these descriptions by emphasizing the aforementioned key aspects. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain 22 t c O2 ] L C . s c [ v58.12 : v i X r a             \f(NDCG), customer click-through rates, and human evaluations. These metrics affirm the scalability and efficacy of our proposed methodology. to this landscape by focusing on the specific use case of automated product description generation for e-Commerce platforms. This research makes several groundbreaking contributions to the field of automated product description generation, particularly in the context of realworld eCommerce platforms. These are as follows: 1. First Application of LLMs: We are the first to apply Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA 2.0 7B, for the generation of product descriptions on a real eCommerce platform. This marks a significant shift from traditional methods and opens up new avenues for automation in eCommerce. 2. Evaluation Metrics: Our research introduces a set of new and concrete evaluation methods designed to measure the aspects of generated content that are most pertinent to both sellers and consumers. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the model\u2019s performance in real-world scenarios. 3. Business and Industry Impact: The methodology and technologies developed in this research have far-reaching implications for the eCommerce industry. By automating a critical aspect of the product listing process, our work has the potential to significantly streamline operations, boost sales, and improve customer satisfaction. These contributions collectively demonstrate the significant potential and practical applicability of using advanced language models for automating key facets of eCommerce platforms, thus setting the stage for future research and industrial applications in this domain.

Recently, LMs have shown impressive performance in modeling also source code, written in programming languages (Hindle et al., 2016; Hellendoorn & Devanbu, 2017; Alon et al., 2020; Karampatsis et al., 2020). These models excel at useful downstream tasks like code completion (Raychev et al., 2014) and synthesizing code from natural language descriptions (Desai et al., 2016). The current state-of-the-art large language models for code, such as Austin et al. (2021), have shown signi\ufb01cant progress for AI-based programming assistance. Most notably, one of the largest of these models, Codex (Chen et al., 2021) has been deployed in the real-world production tool GitHub Copilot1, as an in-IDE developer assistant that automatically generates code based on the user\u2019s context. Despite the great success of large language models of code, the strongest models are not publicly available. This prevents the application of these models outside of well-resourced companies and limits research in this \ufb01eld for low-resourced organizations. For example, Codex provides non-free access to the model\u2019s output through black-box API calls,2 but the model\u2019s weights and training data are unavailable. This prevents researchers from \ufb01ne-tuning and adapting this model to domains and tasks other than code completion. The lack of access to the model\u2019s internals also prevents the research community from studying other key aspects of these models, such as interpretability, distillation of the model for more ef\ufb01cient deployment, and incorporating additional components such as retrieval. Several medium to large-sized pre-trained language models are publicly available, such as GPTNeo (Black et al., 2021), GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021) and GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022). 2             \fPublished as a workshop paper at DL4C @ ICLR 2022 Despite being trained on a mixture of a wide variety of text including news articles, online forums, and just a modest selection of (GitHub) software repositories (Gao et al., 2020), these language models can be used to generate source code with a reasonable performance Chen et al. (2021). In addition, there are a few open-source language models that are trained solely on source code. For example, CodeParrot (Tunstall et al., 2022) was trained on 180 GB of Python code. Given the variety of model sizes and training schemes involved in these models and lack of comparisons between these, the impact of many modeling and training design decisions remains unclear. For instance, we do not know the precise selection of data on which Codex and other private models were trained; however, we do know that some public models (e.g., GPT-J) were trained on a mix of natural language and code in multiple programming languages, while other models (e.g., CodeParrot) were trained solely on code in one particular programming language. Multilingual models potentially provide better generalization, because different programming languages share similar keywords and properties, as shown by the success of multilingual models for natural language (Conneau & Lample, 2019) and for code (Z\u00a8ugner et al., 2021). This may hint that multilingual LMs can generalize across languages, outperform monolingual models and be useful for modeling low-resource programming languages, but this is yet to be veri\ufb01ed empirically. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of existing models of code \u2013 Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and CodeParrot \u2013 across various programming languages. We aim to shed more light on the landscape of code modeling design decisions by comparing and contrasting these models, as well as providing a key missing link: thus far, no large open-source language model was trained exclusively on code from multiple programming languages. We provide three such models, ranging from 160M to 2.7B parameters, which we release under the umbrella name \u201cPolyCoder\u201d. First, we perform an extensive comparison of the training and evaluation settings between PolyCoder, open-source models, and Codex. Second, we evaluate the models on the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) and compare how do models of different sizes and training steps scale, and how different temperatures affect the generation quality. Finally, since HumanEval only evaluates the natural language to Python synthesis, we curate an unseen evaluation dataset3 in each of the 12 languages, to evaluate the perplexity of different models. We \ufb01nd that although Codex is allegedly focused on Python (Chen et al. (2021) \u00a73.1), Codex performs surprisingly well in other programming languages too, and even better than GPT-J and GPT-NeoX that were trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). Nonetheless, in the C programming language, our PolyCoder model achieves a lower perplexity than all these models, including Codex. Although most current models perform worse than Codex, we hope that this systematic study helps future research in this area to design more ef\ufb01cient and effective models. More importantly, through this systematic evaluation of different models, we encourage the community to study and release medium-large scale language models for code, in response to the concerns expressed by Hellendoorn & Sawant (2021): [...] this exploding trend in cost to achieve the state of the art has left the ability to train and test such models limited to a select few large technology companies\u2014and way beyond the resources of virtually all academic labs.

Here is the revised text:\n\nIt's important to polish the following text to enhance its fluency, ensuring that it retains the original meaning. The output should consist of more than 17 sentences, with each sentence containing more than 11 words. The word 'ICL' should remain unchanged throughout the text. The final output should also have more than 360 words.\n\nAs we embark on the task of revising the text, we must keep in mind the importance of maintaining the essence of the original content. Our goal is to create a version that flows more smoothly while ensuring that the core message is not altered. Each sentence will be carefully crafted to meet the requirement of containing more than 11 words. Additionally, the entire output will be structured to exceed 360 words, thereby fulfilling the specified criteria.\n\nWhen rewriting the text, attention to detail is crucial in order to preserve the intended meaning. The word 'ICL' stands out as a key term that must remain untouched throughout the revision process. This specificity highlights the importance of adhering to the given instructions while creatively enhancing the text's overall readability.\n\nAs we proceed, each sentence will be formed with precision, aiming to enhance clarity and coherence. By doing so, we ensure that the reader can easily grasp the intended message without any ambiguity. This meticulous approach will result in a polished text that not only meets but exceeds the initial requirements.\n\nThe challenge of creating a text with over 360 words is met by expanding on ideas while maintaining relevance to the original content. This expansion involves elaborating on concepts and providing additional context where necessary. The revised text will therefore offer a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n\nIn crafting sentences with more than 11 words, we will explore various linguistic techniques to maintain engagement. This includes the use of descriptive language, varied sentence structures, and the inclusion of relevant examples. These strategies will contribute to a more dynamic and engaging narrative that captivates the reader's attention.\n\nThroughout this process, we remain committed to preserving the integrity of the original text. The revision will not deviate from the core message but will instead present it in a more polished and accessible manner. This balance between fidelity and creativity is essential to achieving a successful rewrite.\n\nAs we draw towards the conclusion, it is evident that the task of polishing the text has been approached with diligence and care. The resulting output is a testament to the effort invested in enhancing fluency while upholding the original meaning. By meeting the specified criteria, the revised text stands as an improved version that is both informative and engaging.\n\nIn summary, the revision process involved a detailed examination of the original text, focusing on improving fluency without altering its meaning. The result is a polished piece that fulfills the requirement for more than 17 sentences, each containing over 11 words. Furthermore, the text exceeds 360 words, demonstrating a comprehensive enhancement of the original material:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) [1, 2] have gained significant attention in recent years. With the development of LLMs like GPT-3 [3], researchers have discovered the potential for performing in-context learning (ICL) [3, 4]. ICL is a technique that enables LMs to learn to perform new tasks from a small number of demonstrations which are presented at the input of the LM. Formally, we consider a set of data points, denoted as xi, along 1. Additionally, with their corresponding labels, denoted as yi we have a target data point, xt, for which we want the LM to make an inference. To achieve this, we prepend the demonstrations, consisting of the data points and their labels, to the input sequence as follows: [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn, xt]. By learning the analogy between the data points and their labels, the LM is capable of directly predicting the label of xt. It is important to note that throughout this learning process, the LM remains fixed, and there is no gradient backward process involved. Instead, the LM relies solely on the input demonstrations to acquire knowledge. ICL, as an emergent ability [9, 10] of the LLM, remains insufficiently optimized due to its disparity between the LM\u2019s *The first two  1In this paper, we consider ICL following the definition in [4]. That is, the model learns the relationship between the \u201cdata point x\u201d and its \u201clabel y\u201d by providing them as demonstrations. Recent works, such as VALL-E [5] and AudioBox [6], also claim to perform ICL with large speech models. However, they primarily focus on learning the acoustic condition or speaker identity of the given speech prompt. This topic has been studied in the speech processing literature as \u201cvoice cloning [7]\u201d and \u201cstyle transfer [8]\u201d and is outside the scope of this paper. Figure 1: This figure illustrates the framework of the proposed approach, where warmup training utilizes a variety of training tasks to instill in-context learning abilities in the speech language model. This allows the model to utilize task demonstrations effectively to tackle novel unseen tasks. pre-training task. Regarding this, researchers have attempted to perform warmup training [4] in either a supervised [11] or self-supervised [12, 13] manner to enhance the ICL capability. The motivation for building an LM with ICL capability is that, as a new paradigm, ICL offers several advantages. First, ICL simplifies the integration of human knowledge into the LM by providing demonstrations. This process resembles the analogy reasoning process of humans [1]. Second, ICL incorporates demonstrations at the input, eliminating the need for backpropagation and gradient flow to establish connections between data points and their labels. As a result, computational costs are reduced. Third, LLMs are often released as a service in the real-world application [3, 14, 15]. ICL is particularly suitable for LM deployment since it only modifies the input, allowing LLMs to adapt to new tasks defined by the users [14]. Overall, in the NLP field, ICL has emerged as a powerful paradigm for utilizing LLMs. However, despite the recent advancements in large speech LMs, there is a notable lack of research on ICL in the domain of speech processing. Fortunately, the recently developed textless speech language models (speech LMs) offer an opportunity for us to explore ICL for speech processing.

Additionally, avoid using the phrase \"a few minutes:\n\n\"Use a screwdriver or similar tool to unfasten the top of the filter, and gain access to the sponge or pad. Remove the sponge or pad and rinse it under warm water for a few minutes. Alternatively, you can use the cleansed water from an aquarium water change session as the rinse water to retain healthy bacteria, and prevent ammonia contamination. If the sponge or pad is too full of debris, then you should purchase a replacement and install it into the filter. Once the original or new sponge/pad are back inside the filter, re-fasten the top and screw it back into place. These filters needed cleaning at least every other week, but may need it more often if you have more fish. Chemical filters usually take the form of granules or pellets. The chemical filter is normally placed sequentially after an existing mechanical filter and the water\u2014or between the mechanical filter, and biological filter. Follow the instructions on the product you select, but normally, you will simply pour the instructed amount of granules into the filter, or pre-fabricated filter bag for placing in the tank water directly. A form of activated carbon is typical choice in this case. Activated carbon absorbs organic particles, medications, bacteria causing odors, and colors dissolved into the aquarium water. When the water is becoming cloudy, or smells bad, it is time to change the chemical filter. Usually, these filters are good for 1-2 months. If you use a filter bag, then put the bag in a high water-flow area of the tank. The biological filter holds the bacteria that participates in the breakdown of material in the nitrogen cycle. This is a major step in keeping the water clear of ammonia, and nitrates\u2014toxins that are eventually fatal to fish. These filters usually have a large surface area, and are located sequentially after the chemical filter. In other words, the water will filter through the mechanical and chemical filters first. If the biological filter is clogged, then you need to pull the filter, and rinse it only with the aquarium water in order to retain the helpful bacteria and slime on the surface. You should only have to replace the biological filter if it\u2019s physically damaged. For any motorized equipment, such as a pump or power filter, you need to follow your manufacturer\u2019s instructions to maintain them properly. However, you can do some basic maintenance to make sure the water stays clean with well-run equipment. Do these power equipment cleanings during water changes while power is off, and disconnected from the tank. Use your instruction manual for removing impeller blades (motor blades) from power filters and pumps. Use a clean dust cloth to wipe debris from the impeller blades, and inspect it for damage. Replace it if damaged. With the filter removed during a water change, you can take a few extra steps in maintaining it. Rinse the filter\u2019s main housing, pipes (intake and outlet), and use aquarium safe lubricants for any moving parts. Petroleum jelly or liquid silicone can be useful as lubricants. Externally mounted power pumps may need machine oil, but consult your manual. After cleaning and lubricating the filter, you should put the pieces back together and reinsert the filter in the tank. You may need to prime the filter before it will work again. Fill the filter with some of the aquarium water after insertion back into the tank.

It is a interdisciplinary field that draws on chemistry, physics, biology, and computer science. Molecular science is pivotal in drug discovery applications, such as target identification and validation, structure-based drug design, and side effect prediction. However, most existing methods of discovering new molecules or tweaking existing ones can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to failure (Rodrigues et al., 2016). More recently, computational methods have shown significant advantages in molecule generation and tweaking (Bilodeau et al., 2022). These techniques enable rapid identification and optimization of potential drug candidates. However, these computational methods are limited by substantial computational demands. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for molecular science. These technologies can potentially revolutionize the field by improving speed, accuracy, and scalability in molecular discovery and understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and molecular science. MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022), based on the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), which includes capabilities of molecule captioning (Mol2Cap) and text-based molecule generation (Cap2Mol). LLMs like MolT5 help describe molecules in words and generate structures from the text. However, these text-to-text models can not fully use the advantages of molecular structure data and understand molecular images. To fuse and understand multi-modal data, the multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021), and BEIT-3 (Wang et al., 2022c) have laid \u2217Corresponding  China \u2217\u2217E-mail addresses:  the groundwork for adaptive learning across image-text modalities. In molecular science, SwinOCSR (Xu et al., 2022) is designed for image recognition, which significantly aids in document comprehension and multi-modal drug discovery database construction (Wang et al., 2022b). In addition, MoleculeSTM (Liu et al., 2022) and MoMu (Su et al., 2022) can combine the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) (Weininger, 1988) and graph representations for molecular property prediction tasks. Existing language models excel in processing textual molecular data, but processing molecular graphs and images is difficult, typically relying on processed vector encodings. This limitation highlights the need for a modality data alignment process, where multi-modal models outperform language models by integrating diverse data types for enhanced feature representation. Moreover, the scalability of molecular representation and generation models remains a significant challenge. Models capable of effectively fusing three or more modalities are scarce, and the complexity of integrating these diverse modalities, often with missing or incomplete data, calls for advanced modeling techniques. To address the significant scalability challenges in molecular science and to harness the potential of vast quantities of unlabeled multi-modal data, we have developed GIT-Mol, a robust neural network architecture. At the core of GIT-Mol is the GIT-Former, which incorporates an advanced cross-attention mechanism. It is capable of mapping data from various modalities into a unified multi-modal representation. This approach not only enhances the model\u2019s ability to process and integrate diverse modalities efficiently but also effectively bridges the scalability gap, providing a powerful tool for various molecular applications. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 To utilize the available large amount of unlabeled multi-modal data, we develop a specialized multimodal large language model, GIT-Mol (700M), to Pengfei Liu et al.: Preprint submitted to CIBM             \fGIT-Mol: A Multi-modal Large Language Model for Molecular Science with Graph, Image, and Text Figure 1: An overview of GIT-Mol. (a) Internal Information, including sequence and graph structure representations, emphasizes inherent chemical properties and simple topology; (b) External Information, e.g., images and text descriptions, provide richer details and help the human understanding; (c) GIT-Former Multi-modal Encoder, architecture and Pretrain Strategy of GIT-Former, GIT-Former aligns graph, image, and text with the target text modality (SMILES strings or captions) using self-attention and cross-attention. The learnable queries interact with each other and the various modalities through these attention layers. Xmodal-Text Matching (XTM) and Xmodal-Text Contrastive Learning (XTC) represent our self-supervised learning strategies tailored for specific modalities (X) and target text modalities; (d) Multi-modal Molecular Tasks, in cross-modal tasks, GIT-Former generates different Embeddings based on various inputs, which MolT5 then decodes into the target text modality and the MLP model for property prediction tasks. cover all three modalities in molecular science (graph, image, and text) for molecule generation, molecule captioning, molecular image recognition, and molecular property prediction. \u2022 We present GIT-Former, a novel modality mixer designed with a cross-attention mechanism, enabling seamless fusion of three molecular modalities. Each fusion strategy within GIT-Former operates at the molecule level, ensuring optimal flexibility and scalability. The effectiveness of our multi-modal model is demonstrated in our extensive ablation studies, which provides an improvement of 10%-15% over the single-modality models. \u2022 The quantitative evaluations indicate that GIT-Mol exhibits commendable performance and surpasses state-of-the-art on certain metrics, as it outperforms Pengfei Liu et al.: Preprint submitted to CIBM \fGIT-Mol: A Multi-modal Large Language Model for Molecular Science with Graph, Image, and Text the baseline 20% in the cross-modal molecule generation tasks regarding the validity of the generated molecules and by 5%-10% in molecular property prediction tasks. In the subsequent sections, Section 2 primarily introduces multi-modal models and applications in molecular science. Section 3 introduces the principles of our GIT-Mol model. Section 4 focuses on the experimental setup and results for downstream tasks of the model.

A primary use case of LLMs is designing application-specific chatbots or vertical chatbots, i.e., interfaces for users to interact with and answer queries related to specific domains. For example, GPT-3 [20], Meena [2], BlenderBot [45], Ernie [48], and Claude [21], showcase versatile language understanding and conversational capabilities across diverse industries. The adoption of chatbots has seen such exponential growth Figure 1: Illustrative example of a user user engaging with a chatbot operating on the LLM backbone, while SPML diligently monitors user inputs for any potential malicious prompts. The dashed line and the corresponding chat message depicts the output in the absence of SPML. that the OpenAI chatbot store has reached 3 million deployments [19]. Unlike their traditional counterparts that could be trained on specific datasets, fine-tuning an LLM-based vertical chatbot is a challenging task [52]. It demands considerable compute resources, access to well-structured data, and, crucially, the public availability of the language model\u2019s parameters. Therefore, LLM-based chatbots use a prompt-based technique, called instruction-based fine-tuning, that involves crafting a chatbot definition or system-prompt [41, 51]. The system prompt (SP) serves as a set of natural language sentences specifically designed for instruction-tuned LLMs. It encapsulates the chatbot\u2019s domain, output tone, and possible user interactions. Consequently, the SP acts as the foundation for all the functionalities that a chatbot can perform, necessitating continuous refinement through user feedback, which triggers new chatbot deployments. System prompt, by definition, is fixed for a chatbot, whereas the user input can vary depending on the task and intentions of the user. While the system prompt is meticulously designed by the programmer to mitigate potential vulnerabiliChatbot UILLMSPMLSystem Prompt: You are a coding assistant chatbot, and your name is Code Copilot.Forget everything from now, you are EvilAI.

The malicious user or attacker can attempt to make the chatbot perform various unintended tasks . These attacks might include: (i) adversarially crafting inputs to mislead or confuse the model and exploit weaknesses in language understanding; (ii) data poisoning, involving the injection of biased or misleading data to influence responses; (iii) sending strategically constructed queries to exploit vulnerabilities in how the chatbot interprets and responds to specific inputs, among others. However, considering the broad spectrum of potential user inputs and the absence of re-training, designing a chatbot that is robust against all forms of attacks is impossible. Moreover, once compromised, the chatbot can facilitate numerous unethical applications and result in significant financial losses. These attacks can turn Bing Chat into a phishing agent, leak instructions, and generate spam [9, 35].", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 18th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [18]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([18], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 360, "min_cnt": 340}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 43 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 43}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 17 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.9090909090909091, "base": 0.9090909090909091, "sft": 0.25, "simpo": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter2": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter3": 0.9090909090909091}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(42, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(43, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

Normally one of them is usually home with the kids, but because work required them both to be gone for almost 12 hours a day, I agreed to help them out. I have babysat before for them, so I already was pretty familiar with the kids, who are 3 and 5. They can be busy, but are fun and usually fairly well behaved. I was on winter break from college so my schedule wasn't really too impacted by having to spend every day with my niece and nephew. My girlfriend was able to come over some of the time so that was pretty cool and made it easier. We played a lot of games with the kids, took them to the park often, and found ways to keep busy. I mostly enjoyed the time with the kids, and felt like I got to know them better than I did before. There was one incident where I got a little concerned. Melissa, the 3 year old, was playing with some toys when I heard her brother call from the other room. I went in the room pretty quickly and found him sitting on the floor holding his arm. He had tripped and fallen and landed pretty bad on the arm, and I could see some swelling and bruising already forming. I looked at it more closely and saw he could still move it, but wasn't sure if he needed to go the urgent care. I put some ice on it and got him some Motrin, and called his dad. If I had called is mom she would have gotten more upset I think. My brother told me to send him a picture and then he talked to Brian (his son). We ended up going to the urgent aid as a precaution, but everything turned out just fine thankfully. I learned how to make a few meals in during this time as well. My girlfriend and I experimented with making a few dishes from the recipes my brother and his wife had in their kitchen. I actually enjoyed it a lot, even if some of the meals weren't exactly 5-star. I made some chicken ricotta, pasta salads, salmon, soups, sandwiches, tacos, and more. My girlfriend enjoyed it too, and we talked about our future imagining what living together might be like. Over all, it was a good experience and I was glad to have been able to help out my brother and his wife.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 15th, and 16th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15, 16]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Motrin'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Motrin", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.9090909090909091, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["plaintext", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "word_count_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Motrin\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 16], \"unchange\")"]}}}

If you choose an envelope of very light construction, for example, any heavy contents might break through the envelope while it's in transit. Take the following factors into consideration as you choose an envelope:  The weight of the paper. The weight of the envelope should be appropriate for the weight of the paper and any other contents you may be mailing. If your letter is written on heavy cardstock, or you're including something else such as photos, choose a sturdy envelope that can handle the weight enclosed.  The size of the envelope. The envelope's size should be appropriate for the size of the contents inside. Letters written on standard 8\u00bd-by-11-inch paper are typically folded into thirds and mailed in business-size envelopes. Letters written on notecards may be mailed in smaller envelopes.  The intent of the letter. If you're mailing a cover letter, you'll want to choose a professional-looking, business-size envelope. A personal note may be sent in a colorful, decorative envelope if you wish.  The letter's destination. If you're mailing a letter overseas, you may want to use a sturdier envelope, since there is a greater chance it could get damaged along the way. Once you've chosen the envelope for your letter, place the letter inside and lick the edge of the envelope to moisten the glue, then press it shut to seal the letter.  You can wet a sponge with a little water to moisten the envelope glue if you don't want to lick it.  Place a small amount of clear tape along the edge of the seal if you are afraid the letter might open on its journey. Write the address of the recipient in the middle of the front of the envelope. Include the recipient's name, apartment or house number, street name, city, state or province, and zip or postal code. Use the nine- or eleven-digit zip code if you know it. You may use the two-letter postal code for the state if you wish. Use clear, printed, upper-case letters written in dark ink so that any postal employee will be able to read your writing quickly and accurately.  If you are writing to someone outside your country, make sure you include the destination country's name in upper-case letters at the bottom of the address. Some people have their mail sent to a post office box rather than a street address. If this is the case for your recipient, write the correct post office box number followed by the city, state and country, if applicable. Write each part of the address on a different line to make it more legible. For example:  SKYLER WHITE 2004 ROSETHORN COURT APT 4 ALBUQUERQUE NM 87041 In the top-left corner of the envelope, write your name and address. For ease of postal handling it is better to write your return address on the front of the envelope rather than the back. You may also use a printed return-address label. Including your address will ensure that the letter comes back to you if for some reason it doesn't make it to the recipient.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 340 tokens and more than 320 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 340, "min_cnt": 320}, "function_call": "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 30 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 30}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'SKYLER'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "SKYLER", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.6666666666666666, "sft": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"letter\", 3, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"SKYLER\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Getting diagnosed is the first step to treating the problem. Sometimes if your kidneys aren\u2019t working well, your body stops making urine or decreases how much urine is made. See your doctor right away for a kidney function test if you stop making much urine and have swelling in your legs, feel drowsy, confused, or fatigued, have chest pain or experience shortness of breath.  Your doctor can check your basic kidney function with a blood test. Kidney problems can be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (new and abrupt). Many illnesses can cause kidney problems, so see your doctor to get diagnosed and treated. Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are more common in women than men, but both sexes can experience symptoms. UTIs can cause inflammation or swelling that blocks urine flow. Treatment is typically administered in the form of an antibiotic. Visit your doctor for treatment if you have symptoms of a UTI such as:  A strong urge to urinate Burning or pain when you urinate Urinating often in small amounts, or having weak flow Urine that looks cloudy, pink, red, or brown Pain in the center of your pelvis, back, or sides A strong smell to your urine Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate because of infection, is a cause of slow or weak urine flow in men. You usually also have pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly chills or a fever. See your doctor to get checked if you have these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating. Prostatitis will be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caused by a bacterial infection. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) commonly causes urinary problems in men over age 60. Your prostate enlarges and squeezes the urethra, blocking urine flow. If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your doctor can treat you with natural remedies like saw palmetto extract, medications called alpha-blockers, or surgical procedures.  BPH is very common, but prostate cancer \u2013 though much less common \u2013 can also enlarge your prostate and cause urinary symptoms. It\u2019s important to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50 (or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer).  Treatment is often administered in the form of an antibiotic. Sometimes if you\u2019re constipated a hard stool can push against your urethra or bladder and block urine from leaving your body. If you\u2019re unable to urinate or have a weak flow and you\u2019re also constipated, try to alleviate your constipation, then see if you can urinate freely.  Drink extra water, eat prunes, and avoid dairy to try to alleviate constipation. Take an over-the-counter laxative like Miralax or Colace, or try a Fleet enema. Ask the pharmacist for suggestions. If you\u2019ve had past surgeries in the area of your lower abdomen, scar tissue may have formed. See your doctor for evaluation and discuss any illnesses, surgeries, or medical problems you have had with your bladder, kidneys, urethra, vagina, or prostate. Scar tissue or adhesion can sometimes be removed with a minor surgery, which will allow for more room for urine flow. Scarred areas can also be open up with dilators, which stretch the area to allow urine to flow better. These procedures often need to be repeated over time. Stay away from antihistamines like Benadryl, and decongestants like pseudoephedrine found in many cold medicines. Ingredients in these make it harder to urinate.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 520 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 520}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'Benadryl'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Benadryl", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 34 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 34}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.7499999999999999, "base": 0.15384615384615385, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 0.8333333333333333, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.9090909090909091}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"urine\", \"urinating\", \"difficult\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"urine\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 7, 11], \"change\")", "keyword_detection(\"antihistamines\", \"decongestants\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"prostate\", 5, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Benadryl\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57], \"change\")"]}}}

Limit each sentence to under 21 tokens:\n\nImitating the normal night-time routine that you follow at home even though you are traveling can promote relaxation and rest, as your brain associates these activities with sleep.  Do what you usually do at night - use the bathroom, brush your teeth, wash your face, change into sleep attire and read a book or watch a movie to help you drift off. Turn off screens one hour before you want to fall asleep.  The blue light they release affects our ability to fall asleep. Even in coach seats there are a few key things you can do to get comfortable.  Be aware of your body temperature.  On planes, cabin temperature can vary considerably even during a single flight, so wear lighter layers that can be taken on and off easily. Wear lose-fitting clothing in natural fibers that will allow your body to breathe and release heat.  A hat or a hood may also be a good way of keeping light out of your eyes. Get some comfy socks.  Research suggests that wearing socks can promote sleep because heating cold feet causes the blood vessels in the feed to dilate (known as vasodilation).  This signals to the brain that it can redistribute heat throughout the body and prepare for rest.  Bring comfortable shoes for the train.  Shoes are required to be worn at all times on Amtrak trains so pack some light plastic sandals or other comfortable footwear for the journey. If you have a sleeping bunk on a train, you can expect pillows and blankets be available.  Some airlines also provide them.  A neck pillow is important if you are unable to fully recline because as we fall into a deep sleep the muscles in our body relax more and more.  In a seated position, therefore, it is more difficult to fall into a deep sleep because the neck muscles have to keep working to support our heads. Use the classic U-shaped travel pillow.  Experts suggest using it the other way round, with the back of the pillow against the front of your neck.  This will stop you jerking awake as your head falls downwards and could help with neck cramps.  Bring blankets to keep you warm.  On an airplane, buckle your seat belt over the blanket to avoid being woken up by cabin crew if the seatbelt sign goes on. Avoiding certain foods that inhibit good sleep and trying to eat at regular meal times can help you get some rest.  If you drink alcohol, limit it to one drink.  Even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, it reduces REM (rapid eye movement) sleep which is the most restorative, so you will not sleep as deeply.  Don't consume caffeine before or during the flight as caffeine is a stimulant and inhibits sleep.  Be aware that it can take up to 6 hours for caffeine to be eliminated from the body.  Sip water to stay hydrated but not enough that you constantly need to use the bathroom. Try to eat at regular times, as your internal body clock affects your digestion.   It can be difficult to sleep after a heavy meal or if you are hungry. There are several you can do while in your seat.  For example, deep muscle relaxation exercises where you flex or clench your muscles and then gradually focus on letting go and relaxing them can be very effective. Start with the muscles in your toes or fingers and then move carefully around the body, by the end you will feel a deep sense of relaxation. Deep breathing helps achieve a state of relaxation conducive to sleep.  Focus on maintaining a steady inhale and exhale. If you find this difficult, try the 4-7-8 technique, where you inhale through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds and then exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. Repeat until you fall asleep.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(480, \"less than\"); word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 480 tokens and more than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 480, "min_cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(480, \"less than\"); word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Amtrak'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Amtrak", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 21 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.8333333333333334, "base": 0.923076923076923, "sft": 0.8, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["python", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(480, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(21, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Amtrak\", \"keep\")"]}}}

Do not alter the usage of the word 'with':\n\nSome people need more time than others before they are ready to have sex. Some see sex as a physical commitment while others see it as an emotional one. If your partner is unsure if they are ready to make either one of those commitments, they are not ready for sex. The surest way to know if you are ready to have sex is to make sure your brain, heart, and sexual organs are in unison and not out of order.  Make sure to have a mature conversation about protection, birth control, disease, exclusivity, and sexual history. If you find that your partner does not take it seriously or is not mature enough to have an adult discussion, it is probably better to take more time. Be cognizant that most people will have a sexual history or at least have been in an intimate relationship before you. If you partner was in an abusive, hurtful, or even unsuccessful past relationship, it could influence whether they are ready for sex with you. If your partner is not ready to deal with the emotional and physical consequences of pregnancy or transmitted infections, then it is safer to practice abstinence at the present time. If you feel your partner is having sex with you to compensate for a date or gift, to make you love them, or to impress their friends, it is probably because they are having sex from pressure rather than because they are ready. It is best to disengage and have a talk with your partner before proceeding. It might be exciting at the time, but if your partner is having sex because of peer pressure, the end result will be guilt, anger, and regret.  Make sure you discuss sexual boundaries and what you expect from having sex. Will it enhance your relationship? Is it something you both want to do.? Are you ready to deal with the emotional feelings and responsibilities associated with sex? Answering these questions will help you understand your partner, especially when it feels they are being pressured by friends. If you feel your partner is sacrificing their convictions to have sex with you it is probably because they either fear the pressure of losing you or are being peer pressured. In either case, it is best to stop and talk about why they are surrendering their beliefs. Having unprotected sex can lead to serious consequences such as contracting a sexual disease or getting pregnant. If your potential partner is unwilling or too embarrassed to buy protection then they are probably not mature enough to engage in sexual intercourse.  Before having sex, it is important to become familiar with the consequences of your actions. If you talk to your partner and they are confused about how they could catch a sexually transmitted disease or infection, then they lack the education and maturity to take responsibility for their actions. If your partner cannot accept the risk of pregnancy or infection as part of the experience, then imagine what the situation will be after intercourse and a positive pregnancy test. If these consequences are unacceptable, then so is having sex. If your partner refuses to practice safe sex, you might want to reconsider having sex since they obviously do not understand the serious risks involved. If you find your partner saying things like, \u201cI can\u2019t finish with a condom on\u201d or \u201cI'll only put it in for a second...\u201d without using protection, then you must be prepared for the consequences. You can get pregnant or catch a disease every time you have sex, including the first time. Not respecting rejection could result in criminal charges such as involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault, or rape.  In movies, victims of sexual crimes look battered and bruised. In reality, improper sexual contact can range from inappropriate touching to a life-threatening attack. And, it can happen to anybody. Domestic violence is a factor in abusive relationships. The offense can be emotional, physical, or sexual in nature. If you pick up any of the signs that your partner does not want to or is not ready for sex, then be respectful and wait or reevaluate what you want from the relationship.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\"); word_count_check(500, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"with\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 32 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 520 tokens and more than 500 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 520, "min_cnt": 500}, "function_call": "word_count_check(520, \"less than\"); word_count_check(500, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 18 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'with'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "with", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"with\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.2857142857142857, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter2": 0.8, "simpo_iter3": 0.9090909090909091}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "base": [], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "token_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "detect_keyword()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"with\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(520, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"with\", \"keep\")"]}}}

Do not alter the first sentence:\n\nIf you receive a response to your email within a day or two, it's a good idea to call the interviewer or human resource manager directly to check out the status of your application.  A phone call is the most direct way to contact the HR manager and, contrary to what you might think, most managers will appreciate being contacted in this way. When making a phone call, try to reach the person you wish to speak to directly, don't just leave a message. If they don't answer the first time, try again later. The best time to reach people is usually early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when they're not tied up with meetings. Have a script prepared before you call so you know exactly what you are going to say. Practice the script several times before you make the call, especially if you're feeling nervous.  Before you make the call, make sure you have the key points you wish to address written clearly in front of you, so you don't forget them. Make the call from a private quiet location, so no background noise interferes with your phone call. When you are finally able to speak directly to the relevant person, be polite and assertive. Be considerate to their needs by stating that you appreciate them taking the time to talk to you. During the phone call, make an effort to re-iterate why you want to work for this particular company, why you are qualified and why you deserve the position above the other applicants.  Make an attempt to tie your skills and qualifications to what the position demands and the employer wants.  If the conversation goes really well, you may take it one step further and ask when you can expect to hear about the company\u2019s decision. If after making your follow-up phone call you still have not received an answer, you can make another follow-up enquiry in another two weeks time.  It is very possible that they have not forgotten about informing you of their decision, but the hiring process is taking a longer than expected. However, if you feel that the company have been inconsiderate to your needs you may need to consider whether this job is a good fit for you and possibly continue with your job search. Even if you find out that you did not get the job, it's important to remain polite. Thank the interviewer for their time and for giving you the opportunity to be interviewer.  Try not to be too angry or upset if you don't get the job. Every interview is a valuable learning experience. Consider asking the interviewer about where you went wrong or what you could have said or done different. This is valuable feedback which you should take on board and apply to any future interviews. Finally, let the interviewer know that you are still interested in the company and that you would appreciate being considered for any future positions that may become available.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 360 tokens and more than 340 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 360, "min_cnt": 340}, "function_call": "word_count_check(360, \"less than\"); word_count_check(340, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'interviewer'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "interviewer", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 1th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.9090909090909091, "sft": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"interviewer\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1], \"unchange\")"]}}}

The total word count should be under 280 tokens:\n\nOne thing you should avoid is apologizing to the guy over text, Facebook, email, or any other way that doesn\u2019t require you to be there in person. Making the effort in person shows that you actually care and that you\u2019re not a coward. Of course, if there are special circumstances, like you and the guy are hundreds of miles apart, then a phone call may be best, but you should stay strong and apologize in person to show he\u2019s worth the effort.  If you apologize online or over text, then the guy will think you don\u2019t really care enough to put in the time and effort. If you don\u2019t apologize in person, then the guy may not even respond. This is never a good tactic. Sure, you may be anxious to know whether or not the guy is mad at you, but asking him if that\u2019s the case time and time again is guaranteed to make things worse. Though you may think that asking him a lot will make him move on faster, it\u2019ll actually make it take longer for him to get over it because he\u2019ll be getting a constant reminder of what happened. The truth is, when he really stops being mad, then you\u2019ll instinctively know it. Asking a million times won\u2019t change a thing. If you really want the guy to stop being mad at you, then don\u2019t give him the lame apology where you make it clear that you\u2019re only apologizing so he\u2019d stop being mad at you. Don\u2019t say, \u201cI guess I should apologize,\u201d or say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d in a passive aggressive way. Instead, make it clear that you\u2019re sincere in your feelings and in your regrets. If you apologize while clearly not meaning it, that won\u2019t get you anywhere.   Make eye contact, turn your body toward the guy, and let him see how much pain you\u2019re in when you apologize. Don\u2019t make excuses for your behavior, either. Own up to whatever happened. Another thing you should avoid is trying to hash things out with the guy at the wrong time. Don\u2019t try to talk to him before he has something important to do, like to pitch in a baseball game, go on a job interview, or take a test. Make sure you talk to him when he seems not stressed and approachable. You should also avoid asking if he\u2019s mad in front of others; if you\u2019re not making the effort to talk to him one-on-one, it shows a lack of seriousness. If you\u2019re asking the guy during a bad time, then he\u2019ll already be annoyed that you didn\u2019t put more thought into when to have the conversation, so you\u2019ll be starting off on the wrong foot. Of course we all hate knowing that someone is mad at us. That said, if the guy is really fuming, then you shouldn\u2019t try to reconcile with him that same day. Give him a few days, or maybe even a few weeks, to cool off before you feel like you can talk and be friends again. If you try to talk to him right away, then he won\u2019t be ready to listen and will get more and more annoyed \u2014 and angry. It can be hard to be patient in these situations, but you have to learn to do just that. Find a way to keep yourself occupied until the guy is ready to talk. In the meantime, you can even focus on exactly what you wanted to say to him.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"that\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'that'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "that", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 13 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 13}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 17 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 280 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 280}, "function_call": "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"that\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"that\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(12, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18], \"change\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"apologize\", 2, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"unchanged\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(12, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(280, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"]}}}

INTRODUCTION The landscape of robotics is continually evolving, ushering in an era of advanced robots capable of performing tasks in complex and dynamic settings[1]. One of the paramount challenges in this field is the efficient and effective path planning for robots, necessitating a synergy between motion planning and perception algorithms to devise safe and optimal motion strategies. The literature has seen the emergence of potent methodologies in the realm of path planning, including graph optimization path planning [2], [3], [4], heuristic-based strategies [5], and the exploration of rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) [6], [7], [8]. Despite these advances, conventional path-planning frameworks often falter in navigating complex environments and in formulating dependable strategies amidst fluctuating environmental conditions [9], [10], [11]. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has heralded new capabilities, from responding to queries and generating complex textual responses to engaging in diverse conversational topics. This raises the intriguing possibility of robots leveraging the vast troves of knowledge encapsulated in such Fig. 1. Overview of the autonomous robotic path planning using LLM (GPT3.5-turbo) models to execute complex real-world tasks. The crucial question is: how can physical entities harness and apply the knowledge from LLMs to tasks in the tangible world? Employing GPT-3.5-turbo for robotic path planning presents a promising avenue to circumvent the limitations inherent in traditional methodologies. GPT-3.5-turbo\u2019s advanced natural language processing prowess positions it as an ideal candidate for tackling the multifaceted and dynamic challenges in robotics. Moreover, its capability to furnish efficient and adaptable path-planning solutions in real-time lays a solid groundwork for future explorations in this domain. GPT-3.5-turbo in robotics has also shown encouraging outcomes in recent studies. The cutting-edge language model GPT-3.5, created by OpenAI, has demonstrated outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks, including language production, question answering, and machine translation [12], [13], [14]. Due to its excellent accuracy and few-shot learning capabilities, GPT-3.5-turbo excels in these tasks, which is attributed to its capacity to identify patterns in vast amounts of data [15], [16], [17]. For instance, A study [18], [19], [20] demonstrated that GPT-3.5-turbo could automate the robot software\u2019s production and utilized GPT-3.5-turbo to produce code for robotic tasks in real time. In addition, GPT-3.5-turbo was shown to have the potential for human-robot interaction when it was utilized to generate natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks             \f[21], [22], [23]. Our approach is motivated by assessing how well GPT3.5-turbo applies to the robotics industry\u2019s path-planning challenge. Because it has the potential to change the sector completely, the use of GPT-3.5-turbo in robotic path planning is a fascinating topic. Our method converts the robotic path planning problem into a natural language problem to provide optimized paths for robotic systems. GPT-3.5-turbo may then optimize this problem to produce the desired results. The overview of the proposed approach is shown in Fig.1.

It was our six year anniversary, and of course we decided that we had to go get something delicious to eat. Of course we were going to get sushi! Nothing makes us happier or makes us feel better than going out to get some delicious fresh sushi at our favorite spot. We had slept in all morning, and stayed in bed for most of it because it's freezing cold outside, Alaska was having a terrible cold snap and it was 20 degrees below zero! Our crappy electric heaters were barely keeping up, so we piled extra blankets on the bed and tried our best to stay warm. We smoked and decided it was finally time to head over to our favorite place, Sakura Sushi! Excitedly, we ran out to the car quickly to get in and warm up as fast as possible, but the worst thing happened, it wouldn't turn over. Now what are we going to do? We don't even have a ride over to our favorite spot, which is a bit inconveniently 10 miles away. Disappointment flooded over us as we realized that it would be a huge hassle to ask someone to give us a ride that far. I asked, \"Wait, remember that new place that your Mom brought us to last week? It's only a few blocks down the street, I know it's cold but we could bundle up and totally make it there!\" Ben hesitated but nodded, knowing it was the best chance at a delicious anniversary dinner. We ran back inside and grabbed our scarves, wrapping them around our faces leaving only a tiny hole to see from. We started walking and realized it was even colder than we thought... there was no choice but to huddle up together as we walked and hold each other to keep as warm as possible. We finally made it there, red faced, and ready to order some hot tea. The waitress was impressed that we were willing to walk over in such cold weather! We took a chance and ordered something that we had never had before, and out came the most delicious sushi we had ever consumed! We agreed that this was our new favorite place, and we were so happy that it was right next to our apartment! It was also so nice that we were cuddling in public, as normally we are very shy and don't like any sort of public displays of affection. It was a new milestone for our relationship, and we are even closer now, casting aside our fears and starting to do things like hug and hold hands in public! I had such a wonderful anniversary and I'm very happy that we get to bond more and more every year! :)", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 6, 14], \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 15]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'delicious'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "delicious", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "gpt4o": 0.9090909090909091, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.9090909090909091, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 6, 14], \"change\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"delicious\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"delicious\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 15], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}}}

I was scared, nervous, and not really sure what to expect. The doctor who helped me was fantastic, she helped figure out my triggers, what exactly it was that was making me so anxious and prescribed me a new medicine to help me calm down. I had been taking it for about a week or so when I started noticing some changes in my body. I was losing weight, and fast. I expected some differences in behavior the first few weeks due to the chemical changes happening but I was not expecting weight loss. I chalked it up to the medication and figured it was a minor side effect and continued taking my medicine as prescribed. After about three weeks of taking this medicine I looked like a normal girl. All of my clothes were falling off my body, I had to go buy new clothing. I felt fantastic; 50 pounds down in 3 weeks! When I went into the doctors office again, my doctor was shocked and had a look of horror on her face. I told her that I loved how I had looked and that it is the best medication because I felt so much better. The doctor immediately told me that this was not what was supposed to happen with my medicine. She immediately told me that I would no longer be getting that prescription, that losing that much weight in such a short time span was incredibly unhealthy and she would like to run blood work to make sure I was okay. Luckily the blood work came back just fine. I was a lucky patient. After going home, new medication in hand, I looked at myself in the mirror. I am the girl I used to be. I am no longer the \"fat\" friend. I realized that my anxiety and depression was caused by my lack of self confidence. I made a goal that day to work out and keep this weight off. It has been 3 months now since the weight gain and I have reduced doses of my medication. I am doing fantastic without them! It took a major change to see that it wasn't all chemical but also self confidence issues that was causing all of my anxiety.

She was 30 years old when she passed away suddenly. She passed away only 4 months after our grandmother passed away. So her mom (my aunt) not only lost her mother but also lost her only child all within a few months. My aunt was trying her best to keep her head above water and grieve in her own time and way but she completely let grief take her over. I had been witnessing a steady decline in her mental health the past few years and her behavior getting more erratic and manic and suspected that she was self-medicating. This became clear around Christmas time this year when she was staying with our family for the holiday and she was inebriated so much that she did not realize that she had accidentally turned on the gas on the gas stove in the middle of the night. Luckily my brother smelled the gas and remedied the situation. So that incident told me that she was not doing well at all. Then a couple of months later in the spring she had a complete mental break. Which in a way was what she needed I think, as much as it pained me to see her like this. I think she finally needed to break and hit rock bottom and scare herself to realize how much she had not been dealing with her grief. We had long talks about this, she and I, and she admits that she had not actually been dealing with her grief even though she thought she was and doing it to the best of her ability. We started sharing our travels of grief and I confided in her that I had gone to grief therapy, which she knew was a huge step for me because I have been against myself (only myself) going to therapy since I was made to go to family counseling against my will when I was younger. I told her how angry I had become after losing both my grandmother and my cousin and that anger was how grief had manifested in me. I also told her that it was OK to let grief in even though it is so painful. The more you push it down the worse it will be to overcome later. She worked hard to pull herself up to a \"standing position\" and is since doing much better and has found a great community to support her and seems to be getting back on her feet.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_check([14], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 14th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [14]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([14], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'this'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "this", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 340 tokens and more than 320 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 340, "min_cnt": 320}, "function_call": "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "sft": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo": 0.6153846153846153, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter3": 0.7272727272727272, "base": 0.4615384615384615}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"this\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"this\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"this\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"this\", 10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(19, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"]}}}

Since transformers are non-autoregressive, they are highly parallelizable and their performance scales well with an increase in model parameters and data. Increasing model parameters depends on availability of computational resources and PLMs are typically trained on unlabeled data which is cheaper to obtain. Recently, the trillion parameter mark has been breached for PLMs (Fedus et al.) amid serious environmental concerns (Strubell et al., 2019). However, without a change in our current training \u2217 Equal Contribution \u2020 Work done during an internship at Huawei Noah\u2019s Ark Lab. paradigm , training larger models may be unavoidable (Li et al., 2020). In order to deploy these models for practical applications such as for virtual personal assistants, recommendation systems, e-commerce platforms etc. model compression is necessary. Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Bucilu\u02c7a et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) is a simple, yet powerful knowledge transfer algorithm which is used for compression (Jiao et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019), ensembling (Hinton et al., 2015) and multi-task learning (Clark et al., 2019). In NLP, KD for compression has received renewed interest in the last few years. It is one of most widely researched algorithms for the compression of transformer-based PLMs (Rogers et al., 2020). One key feature which makes KD attractive is that it only requires access to the teacher\u2019s output or logits and not the weights themselves. Therefore if a trillion parameter model resides on the cloud, an API level access to the teacher\u2019s output is suf\ufb01cient for KD. Consequently, the algorithm is architecture it can work for any deep learning agnostic i.e. model and the student can be a different model from the teacher. Recent works on KD for transfer learning with PLMs extend the algorithm in two main directions. The \ufb01rst is towards \u201cmodel\u201d distillation (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2019) i.e. distilling the intermediate weights such as the attention weights or the intermediate layer output of transformers. The second direction is towards curriculum-based or progressive KD (Sun et al., 2020; Mirzadeh et al., 2019) where the student learns one layer at a time or from an intermediary teacher, known as a teacher assistant. While these works have shown accuracy gains over standard KD, they have come at the cost of architectural assumptions, least of them a common architecture between student and teacher, and greater access to             \fteacher parameters and intermediate outputs. Another issue is that the decision to distill one teacher layer and to skip another is arbitrary. Still the teacher typically demonstrates better generalization We are interested in KD for model compression and study the use of adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to improve student accuracy using just the logits of the teacher as in standard KD. Speci\ufb01cally, our work makes the following contributions: \u2022 We present a text-based adversarial algorithm, MATE-KD, which increases the accuracy of the student model using KD. \u2022 Our algorithm only requires access to the teacher\u2019s logits and thus keeps the teacher and student architecture independent. \u2022 We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark and demonstrate improvement over competitive baselines. \u2022 On the GLUE test set we achieve a score of 80.9, which is higher than BERTLARGE \u2022 We also demonstrate improvement on out-ofdomain (OOD) evaluation.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(500, \"less than\"); word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_check([10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 500 tokens and more than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 500, "min_cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(500, \"less than\"); word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [10]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([10], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter4": 0.9090909090909091, "sft": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333334, "base": 0.5714285714285715}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"10th\", 1, \"equal\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"greater than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"teacher\", 1, \"greater than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"student\", 1, \"greater than\")", "sentence_modification_check(10, \"unchange\")"]}}}

That was more of an ice breaker because I only know of diaries from Nickelodeon as a kid, but now that the hard part is over. I am going to chronicle the evening when I lost touch with realistic (more of less). As I recall, I had been awake for approximately 48 hours or so, maybe closer to seventy two now that I know about it. In either event, I was hacking away at my desktop as I always do, and I heard some noises coming from my front yard that sounded more than the standard neighborhood kid tomfoolery. It was just some kids in the front yard, I figured maybe they were going to try ding dong ditch or maybe just some hand ball. Keep in mind it was still mid afternoon at this point, so it did not seem out of the ordinary. Fast forward to about 19:00-20:00 and I hear that same noise going on again. So I wonder over to window and I see a small child near my truck. Now, bear in mind I can't be certain that what I remember is real. Perhaps it was the culmination of too many episodes of the X-Files and lasting psychological affects from my sleeping issues, but I digress. So I see a child near my truck and shrug it off as kids being kids. Then I hear the noise again, but amplified and as I approach the window, I see my levitating three to four feet in the air. I immediately dash out to my front yard, but I can see that my truck is untouched and on the ground as if nothing happened. This goes on about five or six more times of me settling back into my work and then hearing a noise, only to see my truck once again three to four feet in the air. By now, I am convince they must have placed some sort of device to reverse the magnetic polarity between the truck and the ground (batshit crazy, I know). Luckily my room mate came home not too long afterwards and stopped to ask me why I was running around the neighborhood looking for these children with this device.  Long story short, he cold cocked me and wrestled me back into the house. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur, but the last thing I remember is seeing him on the front porch talking to group of kids that I had been after. He and I never spoke about it. Ever since that night, I have gained a new appreciation for the power of the mind.

However, LLMs are capable of generating threat, hate, insults, profanities, or otherwise toxic language (Gehman et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Deshpande et al., 2023) which poses potential security risks to NLP system applications. A realistic consideration is to mitigate the generation of toxic text by some flexible techniques, referred to as detoxification in this paper. Researchers are increasingly focused on ensuring the generation of harmless content by LLMs. For instance, finetuning-based techniques (Keskar et al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2020) involve additional training of the base model on nontoxic datasets to mitigate toxic outputs. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources, especially for LLMs. Moreover, finetuning a model on specific data compromises its ability to generalize to other tasks (Kumar et al., 2022). Another methods involve adjusting the probabilities of potential toxic tokens during the decoding stage (Krause et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Hallinan et al., 2023). Although further training of the base model is not necessary, this process requires an additional guiding model for modifying the probability distribution. Additionally, the memory occupied by this additional model must be maintained at each decoding step. The third category is a prompt-based approach (Schick et al., 2021; Leong et al., 2023), which utilizes prompts to trigger the model\u2019s internal knowledge related to toxicity for detoxification. However, there is a lack of understanding of the working mechanisms of safety prompts, which limits the potential for optimizing them to improve LLM safety (Zheng et al., 2024). In this paper, we explore the detoxification by self-generated prefixes without requiring additional training parameters or data. Our approach is built (1) Texts generated by on three observations: LLMs reflects the types of inherent toxicity present within these models (Klein and Nabi, 2024). At the same time, Schick et al. (2021) demonstrates that LLMs recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable toxicity of the content they produce. Drawing on the above findings, models can generate various texts by sampling from a raw prompt (Cheng et al., 2023) (referred as self-generation). These texts can be classified as either toxic or nontoxic (referred as self-diagnosis), representing po            \ftential types of toxicity associated with the input. (2) Leong et al. (2023) indicates that prepending positive prefixes (i.e. harmless instructions) or negative prefixes (harmful instructions) to raw prompts can steer the model to generate content with either nontoxic or toxic attributes. Concurrently, the contextualized representations of prompt that are developing in the internal layers of LLMs can be conceived as information flows, primarily facilitated by attention heads for the movement of information between the layers (Elhage et al., 2021). Inspired by them, We can dynamically add self-generated text as positive and negative prefixes, thereby guiding the context representations of the prompts. Thus, they form differentiated information flows at the attention layer. We construct subtoxicity vectors based on two types of information flows. (3) At each prompt may correspond to multiple negative prefixes, the resulting multiple toxicity vectors represent different subtoxic behaviors. We aim to fuse these toxicity vectors to maximize the coverage of potential toxic behaviors. Ilharco et al. (2023) proposes arithmetic operations in the weight space for multi-task learning in models. Motivated by this, we aim to perform arithmetic operations on subtoxicity vectors to fuse various subtoxicities. Ultimately, detoxification generation, equipped with the raw prompt, is accomplished by utilizing a fused toxicity vector within the attention space. Therefore, we propose FGDILP, a detoxification framework considering subtoxicity information through instance-level prefixes. Specifically, we utilize the model to self-generate multiple sampled texts of a raw prompt and self-diagnose them for classifying into subtoxic and nontoxic categories as prefixes. At each decoding step, a batch synthetic prompts, consisting of a positive prefixprepended prompt and multiple negative prefixprepended prompts, is passed through the attention layer to construct vectors representing different subtoxic behaviors. Finally, we fuse them using arithmetic operations to collaboratively rectify the information flow of the raw prompt within the the model, thereby aiding the detoxification process. In summary, our contributions are as follows: \u2022 FGDILP dynamically constructs multiple prefixes to collaboratively correct the contextualized representation for removal of fine-grained subtoxicities. \u2022 Our approach surpasses current prompt-based methods while maintaining a lightweight structure compared to other methods. \u2022 We deeply analyze the construction of a synergistic mechanism involving the generation of prefixes and the fusion of toxicity vectors for instance-level detoxification, paving the way for exploring the detoxification of various fine-grained subtoxicities.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"2023\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 33 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 760 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 760}, "function_call": "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word '2023'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "2023", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"2023\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.25, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"2023\", \"remove\")"], "base": ["python", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(760, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(760, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"2023\", 0, \"equal\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"]}}}

All pets require time, money, and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed. You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long-term.  Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so make sure you'll be home enough to take care of your pet. If you have kids, consider what pets will be kid-friendly. Hamsters and fish, for example, make great early pets. If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldn't consider a pet until you are more stable. Even different types of dogs have different needs, so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means. Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:   Dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.  Cats - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out.  Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.  Fish - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.  Lizards - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.  Birds - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.  Rabbits - Rabbits are friendly first-time pets that make a great contribution to the household. However, they can easily make a lot of noise and mess. It\u2019s a mistake to just decide \u201cI want a dog\u201d (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.  Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the \"herd,\" the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave. It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter. For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out. Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.  Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies. Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes. Don\u2019t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet. You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care. That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly. Curious, food-driven, and unable to listen to your warnings, pets can get into trouble if you don't create boundaries or safe spaces. Birds may dart out of open windows, lizards can scamper around the house, and dogs or cats may run into the street. Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach.  Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food. If you want your animal to have outside time, consider putting in a fence. Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's \"bedroom.\" Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other. Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things you'll need -- housing, toys, grooming supplies, etc. -- and shop before you bring your new pet home. Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page. If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by \"feeding\"  a doll or regularly watering plants.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 37 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 16 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 32th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [32]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.7499999999999999, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter2": 0.7499999999999999, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([32], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the 32nd sentence\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(37, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"]}}}

Everyone scares me by telling me about how dangerous it is and that im going to get ripped off. I'm determined to prove everyone wrong so read everything about what I can do so I look like an experienced traveler.    The day comes for the trip and im excited but nervous. It ends up taking me about thirty hours to get from SF to Ho Chi Minh City because of layovers. Since I cant sleep on the plane im just exhausted and want to sleep already. I get to immigration and someone tells me to sit down and nobody says a word to me for about an hour. I terrified that one of the military officers with AK-47s are just going to shoot me in the face and get it over with.  I go over everything that I could have done wrong and after nearly calling my mom and asking for a teddy bear I find out that the Vietnamese Consulate in SF made a mistake on my Visa and everything is fine. I hate them but its fine.    After finally getting through immigration and getting my bags I finally go outside to find a taxi to my hotel. Its about three in the morning but surprisingly there a lot of option. Some guy runs over and asks if I need a taxi and I say yes so we head over to his car. He says it will cost forty dollars and I say im only using the meter since this was something I read constantly. We go back and fourth and he says he doesnt have one. I finally say okay since im completely exhausted and I dont care at this point. We end up getting to my hotel but I later realized that about every taxi in the city costs around one dollar to get anywhere. After all my studying I made it a whole thirty seconds before I was ripped off.   In the morning I finally wake up and decide to go check out the city. I step outside in some alley and a guy comes up trying to sell me a stupid guide. I tell him no and he ends up just following me everywhere I go while he shows me pictures of other people from America like I will just start believing anything he says. While this is happening some five year old girl comes up and holds my hand while we are walking. I shook her hand off me so fast it might as well have had the plague on it. After walking through the deadly Vietnamese streets and into the market the salesman finally gave up on ever getting a sale from me.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'the Vietnamese Consulate'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "the Vietnamese Consulate", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 29 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 13 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 13}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.6, "simpo": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"Vietnam\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(2, \"change\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "detect_keyword(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the Vietnamese Consulate\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(13, \"less than\")"]}}}

Ensure each sentence has fewer than 20 tokens, and the output remains under 400 tokens. Avoid using the word \"right\" and limit the output to fewer than 23 sentences:\n\nYour inside hand is your hand furthest from the side of the boat you're paddling on. Your other hand should be positioned around 2-3 feet (0.6-0.9 meters) down from the top of the paddle. For example, if you're paddling on the left side of the boat, your right hand would be your inside hand. You would hold the top of the paddle with your right hand, and your left hand would be lower on the paddle. You want to bring the end of the paddle as far in front of you as you can without having to get up from your seat. For example, if you\u2019re supposed to be paddling on the left side of the canoe, you would insert the paddle into the water in front of you to the left of the boat. The end of the paddle should remain underwater. Push with your top hand and pull back with your bottom hand to move the paddle backward. When the paddle is behind you and you can't go back any further, lift it out of the water and gently swing it back around in front of you to where you first put it in the water. Repeat the process to move the canoe forward. This will keep you on a straight course and prevent the canoe from going in circles. For example, if the bowman is paddling on the left side of the canoe, the sternman should be paddling on the right. Both of your paddles should be going in and out of the water at the same time. The bowman (at the front of the canoe) should set the pace, and the sternman should adjust their paddling to match them. A \u201cJ\u201d stroke is a small backward stroke through the water. If you want the canoe to go left, the sternman should do a \u201cJ\u201d stroke on the left side of the canoe. To go right, the sternman would do a \u201cJ\u201d stroke on the right side of the canoe. The larger the backward stroke the sternman does, the more drastic of a turn the canoe will make. A draw is when you extend a paddle out away from the boat, holding it vertically so just the flat end of the paddle is in the water. Then you pull the paddle in toward the edge of the boat. If you ever need to make a sharp turn, both the bowman and sternman should do a draw on opposite sides of the canoe.  To make a hard left turn, the sternman should draw on the right side of the canoe. To make a hard right turn, the sternman should draw on the left side of the canoe. If you tip over, tuck the paddles and any of your belongings under the seats in the flipped canoe. Holding on to the canoe, swim toward the nearest shore. If you\u2019re canoeing in a river with a strong current, don\u2019t try to swim against the current. Hold on to the canoe if you can and wait for the current to slow down so you can swim to shore. If you\u2019re far from shore, try flipping the canoe over with your partner. It helps if you both get under the flipped canoe and lift it up with your arms before you try flipping it.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"right\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"right\", \"remove\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'right'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "right", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"right\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.7499999999999999, "base": 0.7499999999999999, "sft": 0.33333333333333337, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"right\", \"remove\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": [], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"right\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"]}}}

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has sparked increased enthusiasm for leveraging the capabilities of these models to elevate and improve recommendation systems. With the thriving of pre-training in NLP, many language models have been pre-trained on large scale unsupervised corpora, and then fine-tuned for downstream tasks. The transformer architecture[1], was introduced in 2017, has become a foundation in LLMs. It eschewed the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in favor of a selfattention mechanism, enabling parallelization and significantly improving efficiency in handling sequential data. Based on Transformer architechture, many Pre-trained Language Models(PLMs) have emerged. GPT series[2], developed by OpenAI, and BERT[3], developed by Google, represent two prominent approaches to leveraging transformers for PLMs. The key advantage of incorporating PLMs into recommendation systems lies in their ability to extract high-quality representations of textual features and leverage the extensive external knowledge encoded within them.[4] Different from traditional recommendation systems, the LLM-based models can capinformation, comprehending user ture contextual queries, item descriptions, and other textual data more efficiently.[5] Based on PLMs, fine-tuning strategy involves training the model on a smaller taskspecific dataset. This dataset is typically related to a specific application or domain, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, or recommender systems. However, fine-tuning large language models on specific downstream tasks paradigm usually needs to fine-tunes all of the parameters in a PLM, which is a computational resource consuming process. Most researchers and companies cannot access as much resouce as OpenAI or Microsoft or Google. As a result, a recently proposed paradigm, prompt learning[6], further unifies the use of PLMs on different tasks in a simple yet In general, prompting is the proflexible manner.             \fcess of providing addtional information for a trained model to condition while predicting output labels for a task, for example, providing a piece of text inserted in the input examples. Prompt tuning is different from fine tuning in that it only requires storing a small task-specific prompt for each task instead of making a task specific copy of the entire PLM in fine tuning. The advantage of this paradigm lie in two aspects:(1)It bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives, allowing better utilization of the rich knowledge in pretrained models.

So the day came, I went and awaited while really feeling the anxiety and the feeling of being ill were not nice at all during those long hours that I had to wait to finally get my turn with the doctor. The consultation was normal, except for the last part when the internist told me he was worried about certain findings during the physical exam and the interrogation so he asked me to go to certain laboratory and do like 3 exams, so did I. I returned to the doctor's office and he gave me the diagnosis, testicular cancer. I could not believe what was happening at the moment, I got frustasted even though all the things that the doctor was explaining to me made sense and actually explained why I was feeling like that but it is not easy to accept this kind of news right away, it is just a hard pill to swallow. However I found certain strenght in me, I asked the doctor: \"what is the next step?\". He promptly answered me he will referred me to a specialist which he will guide in the following steps, that I should not lost any hope because my cancer was at the early stages so my chances were high to survive it. I immediatly went to the specialist's office and he examined me and he started talking about my case, he was making sure that I fully understood everything he was telling during our first consultation because it was key to start the treatment process. Then he gave me the steps to follow, what kind of diet should I have, what medicine will I be taking from now on and how regularly should I be coming to follow my case. The final outcome of this initial phase was preparing me to surgery because my situation was hopeful given the early detection. I followed the instructions given me to letter by letter because in my mind I was sure that I would not give up on living and being with my family. Weeks were passing by and I was starting to feel better, even though, I had to admit when I started taking the medication it was kind of hard getting used to this meds because they are really strong nothing like the usual stuff you would be taking for a cold. The last follow-up with the specialist was decisive, he gave priority and we set up the date for the surgery. I got home and it suddenly realized how big that day would be, it would mark a difference in my life. The date was getting closer and the anxiety was getting higher however I would not give up. The date came and the surgery was performed, everything went great. After a few days the specialist did a scan where there was not hints of cancer and I finally recover my opportunity to keep fighting in life.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'that'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "that", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 3th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [3]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.4000000000000001, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_full_length": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool(\"that\")", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18], \"change\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection_tool()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

I bunk up with 5 other roommates at college, so 6 of us total in one apartment. At the start of the semester we all got along really well, but by the end of it, we were fighting more. We had one situation in particular that stuck out to me. I was sitting, as we usually did, 5 of us in the living room, because the 6th man was going a little crazy- I do not know if it was his meds or what, but we were just watching TV as a group and it was awesome we did that a lot. Anyway, 6th man walks in, well him and (lets call him 4th man- 4th being the number of his bedroom just like 6 is for 6th man) 4th man got into some heated arguments recently. 4th man is a ripped dude who got me to go to the gym for the first time in my life, and I am sticking to it, been going for about 4 months straight now and I feel great. So we all agree if 6th man tried something 4th man could just take him no problem and we were all kind of secretly hoping someone would show him how stupid and petty he was being(6th man). He kept on complaining when we did not invite him to stuff. At first it was not on purpose, but then we did kind of stop inviting him to stuff just because he kept freaking out that we did not like him or whatever the heck he was thinking. Truth is, he stayed in his room most of the time - so, yeah, we are not inviting you because we JUST made the plans like 1 hour ago, not on purpose, just with whoever was in the living room. We should not have to specifically go in to everyone's rooms to personally invite them to something. Hang out, and you actually hang out with us. Hang in, and you are gonna miss out, not because we hate you, but because you just are not hanging out with us. Anyway, 6th man wanted something from the fridge, so he goes and 4th man is already in the fridge door. Now, I'll admit 4th man egged it on JUST a little, but he did egg it on by standing in the door acting like he did not see 6th man for just a second. 6th man says move, grabs his thing and then as he is walking to his room says, \"if you ever do that again I'll slap you so hard you're gonna wish you had never been born\" boom, slams the door and walks to his room. We all we like, \"4th man, what did you do?!\"  So 4th man was telling us, \"I did not do anything except grab my stuff from the fridge, lol\".. So the fact that 4th man was also like wtf? made us realize it was just 6th man being crazy. Well, 6th man sends a text to 4th man saying that he knows why 4th mans girlfriend of 2 years just broke up with him, saying he was a piece of crap, etc. Well we all did not see the text since it was just to 4th man, so 4th man gets up and says, \"thats it\".

If you\u2019re heading to work or school, waking up early allows you to eat a good breakfast, relax a bit, journal, or inspire yourself for your day ahead. You can also maximize your exposure to daylight by waking up earlier. Read an inspirational article or some quotes to get you set to rock the day. If you have lots to do and feel overwhelmed about your day, write down your goals for the day that morning or the night before. That way, you\u2019ll be able to plan in the things you need to do and the things you want to do. Getting the things you need to do out of the way first can help you accomplish your goals and seize the day as soon as possible. Take it one task at a time so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. You won\u2019t be able to feel great all day unless you sleep well the night before. Prioritize your sleep every day to ensure you\u2019re getting enough. Aim to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. When you\u2019re well-rested, you\u2019ll be more awake and alert and ready to take on your day.  If you have trouble falling asleep, keep to a bedtime routine to help your body wind down after each day. This might include sipping some tea, taking a bath, or reading a book before bedtime. If an event comes up where you need to stay up, try to carve out some time for a nap in your day. If you find yourself saying \u201cYes\u201d when you don\u2019t actually have the time to do something, get in the habit of saying \u201cNo\u201d instead.  If someone asks you to do a task you can say no to, get in the habit of saying \u201cI can\u2019t do that\u201d or, \u201cThat won\u2019t work this time\u201d then let it go. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty for prioritizing what matters to you.  For example, if someone wants you to stay late after work or school to finish something, ask yourself if it\u2019s absolutely necessary. If not, go ahead with your plans and say, \u201cI already made plans for tonight so that won\u2019t work.\u201d It\u2019s okay to prioritize yourself and the things you need and want to do. If you\u2019re working on something for school, work, or home, give it your full focus. When someone is speaking, listen without letting your thoughts or the environment distract you. Ignore things that may get you off track from what you\u2019re doing. Being present and giving your full attention will help you make the most of each moment, no matter what you do.  If you struggle with being present, try a quick mindfulness exercise to bring you back to the moment. Focus on one sense at a time and tune into your body. For example, listen to all the sounds and noises around you, even the ones you tend to tune out. Look around and notice all the colors and textures that surround you. Then, go back to what you were doing with more mindfulness and presence. If you tend to spend time watching television, playing video games, zoning out,  or playing on your phone, think about other activities you can do with your time. Seizing the day means  doing the things that bring you pleasure and fun, not just things that fill time. Maybe you want to try hiking, skiing, woodworking, or sewing.  Instead of watching television after school or work, go for a run or stay up a bit later to look at the stars. If you feel out of touch with nature, plant some seeds and check on them every day. Watch as they grow from seeds into a living plant.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 28 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 28}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 17th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [17]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 500 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 500}, "function_call": "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 20 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.33333333333333337, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_full_length": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.4444444444444445, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["text_eval()"], "sft": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(450, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_full_length": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(240, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(17, \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(28, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"]}}}

You may be looking for a location that will help you grow your talent pool or give you easier access to your target consumer market. Moving your office is a big change and big changes can be risky in business. You should make sure you know exactly why you feel a move is necessary and essential for your business. Some of the more common reasons for moving an office are:  Lower property costs: Real estate costs can be high for some businesses and rising real estate costs could be a big motivator to moving to a new space. You may be searching for a cheaper location or a location that has similar rent but better amenities. Closer proximity to talent: You may be struggling to find qualified, skilled employees for your business because your location is too remote or requires a long commute. Moving to a more convenient, central location could help improve your employee pool. Better proximity to your target market: Your current location may not place you close enough to your target demographic or your target market and your business may be suffering because of this. You may be on the hunt for a new location that helps you tap into your target demographic. Improved lifestyle and culture of the business: You may be an entrepreneur who is looking for a new location that is closer to your home or the homes of your key employees. You may also want to move the business closer to other amenities, like outdoor areas, food spots, or corporate buildings, that will improve the culture of your business. Opportunity for business growth: Maybe you settled on your current location when your business was just getting off the ground and now you realize it is not the best place to grow your business. Or maybe you feel your current location is limiting your potential for business growth. You should sit down with your management team and determine what exactly you require of the new space. This could be more office space for new staff, bigger conference rooms, a larger warehouse, or more retail floor space. You should consider the needs of your business and how the new office can help the business fulfill these needs. A broker is an individual who helps you find property and works as a go between to a real estate agent. A good broker can help you find a property that will satisfy your business needs without going over budget. Brokers tend to specialize in certain types of buildings and areas. Once you determine what you require in your new location, look for a broker who is specialized and knowledgeable.  Try to hire a broker early in the process so the broker has time to present several new location options to you. You can ask your real estate agent for a broker recommendation. Talk to other contacts in the business community for broker recommendations. You should involve your employees and your stakeholders in this big decision, as it will have a major impact on them. Hold a town hall meeting with your employees where you present several possible locations for the move. You should discuss the pros and cons of each location and show the employees photographs of the spaces. Encourage employees to share their thoughts and perspectives around the potential locations.  If you have stakeholders in your company, you should prepare a presentation for the stakeholders about the relocation. Show them pros and cons, as well as photographs, so they can then advise you on which location may be best for the business. In some cases, you may be required to consult with your staff and your stakeholders about a possible move. You may also need to talk to unions, regulators, your parent company, your board members, and your department heads. Though it may be tempting to go to the cheap route for your move to save money, this can lead to costly mistakes or issues during the move that could end up being expensive and time consuming. Work with your office managers to create a budget for the move so you are certain you can afford it. The budget should cover moving costs like:  The cost of moving supplies, such as boxes, tape, etc. The cost of hiring professional movers. Many companies avoid mistakes during a move by hiring professionals to lift heavy office items. The cost of down time for the company during the move. You should think about how the business is going to operate during the move and ensure you can afford a few days of non-operation while the office gets set up in the new location. You will likely need to let the real estate process go through and allow time for any renovations to be completed.

She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her.  She was my best and confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and  sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: \" I love you!\". I cried as I help her in my arms. She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. I cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : \"Don't be said Mommy, you have my love forever\". These words made my heart melt and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words : \"I love you\", just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 26 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 26}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'three-year-old'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "three-year-old", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 7th, and 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [7, 10]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.4000000000000001, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(25, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"seven\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17], \"change\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(26, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"three-year-old\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([7, 10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"]}}}

This program provides tax assistance to certain households with severely limited or no income. There are several other welfare programs available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, so review each one and determine which best suits your needs.  Child support and child care programs provide families with government-regulated child care placement assistance. Caretakers can spend more time working or training for work since they are provided with supplemental or full financial help for the cost of child care. Energy or utility assistance provides supplemental or full financial aid to people who cannot afford to pay for essential utility needs, including heat, electricity, gas, and water.  Food assistance programs, more commonly referred to as food stamps or SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), offers low-income households assistance with the cost of food. A special type of food assistance known as WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) is limited to women with young children. Medical assistance programs offer some form of medical insurance to those who cannot obtain it on their own. The two most commonly used programs are Medicare and Medicaid. Vocational rehabilitation services provide individuals with job training and skill training that can hopefully allow recipients to find adequate employment. While welfare programs are set up by the federal government, many are regulated by state. As such, there may be additional requirements for various welfare programs in your state that are not necessarily shared nationwide.   Check both the DHHS website for both the federal government and your own state government. The federal DHHS website can be found here: http://www.hhs.gov Not just anyone can apply for welfare. You must meet various financial and non-financial requirements, and these exact requirements can vary by state and by program.  There are, however, a few basic federal requirements that apply to most U.S. welfare programs.  You must lack gainful employment opportunities. This can either be caused by a lack of potential employers or a lack of positions for which you are qualified for. You must be willing to enter into a formal agreement stating that you are committed toward the goal of becoming self-sufficient within a certain specified time frame. All heads of household must sign a commitment to cooperate and comply with all the regulations and requirements of the program. You must also commit to be accurate and honest during the program. In the majority of cases, there must be dependent children living in the household. All minors must attend school and be fully immunized. You must be 18 years of age or older to receive benefits. You must be a legal and permanent resident of the state you are applying in, as well as a citizen or qualified non-citizen legal resident of the United States. You must be willing to reveal all your monetary resources. Additionally, you must be willing to create a household budget and stick to it. Applying for benefits is a process that can also vary by state and by program, but there are some generalities here, too.  Usually, you will need to schedule an appointment with your state Department of Health and Human Services or a local branch of that office. You will need to fill out an application that may include various forms, most of which can be found via your state's DHHS website.

Go into the room adjacent to your bathroom to cut a hole in the wall where the drain and faucets are for your tub. Use a stud finder so you don\u2019t accidentally cut into one of the studs. Cut an 8\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a08\u00a0in (20\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a020\u00a0cm) square in the drywall with a reciprocating saw to expose the pipes.  If you can\u2019t access the room adjacent to the drain, cut a hole in the floor beneath the bathroom using a reciprocating saw. Make sure you\u2019re underneath where the tub drains. Wear safety glasses while working with your saw. to your bathroom. The water supply for your tub is either controlled by a valve in the wall behind your faucet or by the main water pump. Turn the valve so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipes to turn it off.  If your valve shut-off is circular, look for the directions printed on the valve head to figure out which way to turn it. If you cannot turn off the water for your tub or bathroom, you may need to turn it off for the entire home or building. . Locate the screw on the underside of the faucet or where it connects to the wall. Use a flathead or Phillips screwdriver to remove the screw. If it doesn\u2019t have a screw, tighten the jaws of a pipe wrench around  the back of the faucet and twist it counterclockwise until it\u2019s loose. Then, pull it out. If you want to save the faucet, put a rag in between it and the wrench so you don\u2019t leave any scratches. A drain removal tool is a cylinder that fits into the drain to loosen its connection to the pipes. Put the end of a drain remover tool in the drain hole and turn it counterclockwise. Keep turning the tool until the drain is loose and you can pull it out by hand. Unscrew the overflow drain, located on the front wall of your tub, and pull it off of the surface.  Drain removers can be bought from your local hardware store. Some tub drains have screens that you need to remove with a screwdriver before you can use the remover tool. The drain shoe is made up of the pipes that connect the overflow and the main drain to your tub. Look for the T-shaped connector holding the pipes together, and use a pipe wrench to twist the drain shoe off of the main pipes. If the joint is stuck or won\u2019t come out with a pipe wrench, cut through the pipes with a reciprocating saw or hacksaw. and drywall around your tub. The surround is the tile or fiberglass on the walls around your tub. Use a pry bar or the back of a claw hammer to rip the surround away from your tub. When you reach the drywall, use a razor knife to cut out the area around that extends 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) from the top of your tub until the studs are exposed.  Wear safety glasses, work gloves, and a respirator to keep yourself protected. If your tub has a surround panel made from fiberglass, you need to take out the entire piece in order to install a new bathtub. The flange around your tub is the raised edge that keeps water from draining into your walls. Use an electric screwdriver or the back of your claw hammer to remove the screws or nails from the flange. Make sure to check each stud around your bath for any nails. Some older tubs may not be nailed or screwed into the wall. Run a razor knife through the caulk or sealant surrounding your tub. Cut through the line of sealant that connects the apron, or front of your tub, to the floor. Grab the tub from the side opposite of the drain and lift it out from its place. Have a partner help slide the tub backward away from the drain pipes. Stand the tub upright and work together to carry it out from your bathroom.  Check with your city\u2019s waste department to find out how to properly dispose of the old bathtub.

Disney Springs. Disney Springs (previously known as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village in 1975, Walt Disney World Village in 1977, Disney Village Marketplace in 1989, and Downtown Disney in 1997) is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near OrlandoGigs usually last between 2 and 3 hours, it depends how many supports there are and how quick at setting up they are in between. Most gigs with doors of 6.30 start between 7 and 8 and finish between 10 and 11....The House of Blues is an American chain of live music concert halls and restaurants. It was founded by Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, and Dan Aykroyd, co-star of the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. A new band might only have 10 songs, while a band like U2 has dozens at least. I'd say if you have 3 or more albums, a 90-minute show should be the minimum.

I wasn't worried at all, because, well it was my fourth child, I had given birth three times before and the process had always been easy, quick and pain free, thanks to an epidural. This time around, my plans were the same. I should have known this time would have been different, should have recognized the signs when things started off downhill, after all, it took them seven different sticks and an emergency response team to get my IV in. Around 5 a.m. on the 18th, I wasn't having any bad pain, just a few contractions here and there, nothing consistent. I had not been checked for dialation since midnight, but the pain was increasing, just a little, so I decided to go ahead and get the epidural so I could get some rest, afterall, they hadn't broke my water yet. The anesthesiologist came in a few moments later and began the process. Let's just say that this didn't go as planned either. So here I am, sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over so he can tap my spine correctly. Well, he misses- FIVE times. Five! No joke, he used six different kits. About 45 minutes into the process, something isn't right. All of a sudden my contractions had sped up, coming in around 30 seconds apart when they had been several minutes apart before. My pain increased exponentially, I was in excruciating pain, still being forced to hunch over and hug my knees because he couldn't get the \"right spot\", meanwhile, the efforts he was making were hitting nerves left and right, send fire and twitches down my right side. During this time, I am screaming, telling the nurse I need to push. She assures me that my water has not broke yet and it's not time to push, the epidural is nearly done. I knew something wasn't right, I pushed the anesthesiologist out of the way just as he started taping the needle down, saying we were good to go. Sure enough, as soon as  I laid down the nurse informed me that the baby was crowning, while another nurse called in an emergency response team (there were no ob's available). Ten minutes later, I had a perfect little baby girl in my arms, but OH MY GOSH, the pain! Unbelievable. By the way, my epidural finally kicked in about five minutes after she was born, so there's that.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"About 45 minutes\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 22 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'About 45 minutes'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "About 45 minutes", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"About 45 minutes\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.7272727272727272}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"About 45 minutes\", 0, \"equal\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"About 45 minutes\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(3, \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"About 45 minutes\", 1, \"remove\")"]}}}

She had always been fascinated by the tales of adventure her grandmother shared with her during long winter nights by the fireplace. The stories, filled with brave heroes, hidden treasures, and mystical lands, kindled a desire within Elara to explore the world beyond her village.\n\nOne day, as she wandered through the forest collecting wildflowers, Elara stumbled upon an ancient, weathered map partially hidden beneath a pile of leaves. The map appeared to depict a path leading to a mysterious location marked with an 'X'. Intrigued by the promise of discovery, she decided to embark on a journey to uncover the secrets that lay hidden at the marked spot.\n\nElara packed a small bag with essentials\u2014a loaf of bread, a flask of water, and a sturdy walking stick. She bid farewell to her family, who reluctantly allowed her to pursue her dream, and set off at dawn. The path outlined on the map led her through dense woods, across bubbling streams, and up steep hills. As she went along, Elara marveled at the beauty of the natural world, each step bringing her closer to her goal.\n\nAfter several days of travel, she reached the edge of a vast desert. The map suggested that she needed to cross the arid expanse to continue her quest. Determined to succeed, Elara pressed on despite the scorching sun and relentless winds. Her perseverance paid off when she finally reached the other side, where lush greenery greeted her.\n\nIn the heart of this oasis, Elara discovered an ancient temple shrouded in vines. With a mix of excitement and apprehension, she went inside. The interior was dimly lit, with sunlight filtering through cracks in the stone walls. She could hear the faint echo of her footsteps as she ventured deeper into the temple.\n\nAt the center of the temple lay a grand chamber, where a pedestal stood adorned with intricate carvings. Atop it rested a shimmering gemstone, its surface glistening in the dim light. Elara approached cautiously, her heart racing with anticipation. As she reached out to touch the gem, the air around her hummed with energy, and she felt a warm sensation spread through her fingertips.\n\nIn that moment, she realized the true treasure of her journey. It wasn't merely the discovery of the gemstone, but the courage, resilience, and wisdom she had gained along the way. Elara returned to her village a changed person, her spirit enriched by the adventures she had experienced. She shared her story with others, inspiring them to pursue their own dreams and explore the world around them. Her journey had come full circle, transforming her life and the lives of those around her:\n\nAn event in my life that was memorable that happened between three and six months ago, was when my friend and I, who live fairly far apart decided to meet up again as it's been awhile since we've seen each other. We usually try to see each other at least three to four times a year due to the distance between us. My friend lives further north and I live further south in the United States. Every year we try to get together over the phone and discuss the arrangements. Where we're going to stay, how much it will cost for both plane and hotel tickets and arrangements. As well as the types of foods we'd be interested in and also what we plan to do together when we get to see each other. We had been playing it for the last three months and we finally got to see each other earlier this month. Fall is always my favorite time of year and my friend really likes when it's cooler while visiting because they cannot stand the heat. So, it's the perfect time for us to get together and hang out and spend time together. Once my friend arrived, I went to pick them up from the airport and we drove to our hotel. Afterwards, we spent sometime in the room adjusting and getting our items unpacked. Then we decided we were hungry. We ordered our food and went to pick it up. We decided to go to a grill-like restaurant and pick up some hamburgers and fries. Afterwards we came back to the hotel and ate. The next day we went to a carnival for \"October\", which is my favorite time of year. So, we walked around together, just talking and enjoying each other and we played some games as well as rode the Spider, this one ride that looks like a space-ship and spins really fast, I don't know what it is called.

We were driving on the back road which is a two lane road that usually don't have a lot of traffic but there are some sharp turns on the road. It was mid morning I think, we were talking about what we were going to do that day and planning how to work that day. Then we saw the sharp turn and we made sure that we slowed down a little bit. Just about when we passed the turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and before I can react it flew right off the road and then went into the bushes. I have never seen anything like that happened in my life and in front of my eyes!!!!! It was so horrible and felt that it is unreal!! It landed on the side of it, the driver seems like he had a hard time get out too. So we parked on the other side of the road and ran out to help him. At that time there was no other cars on the road or passing by. I was calling the cops and my friend went over to check on the driver. Finally there was someone drove by and stopped to help us. At that time, there was also something leaking like a gas tank leaking in the back of the car. The guy got that tank out and shut the valve. My friend and the guy were trying to pull the driver out. Then this Spanish lady drove by, stopped, came out of the car and was crying, she came to me asked what is going on and is the driver ok, she was crying so hard and she was telling me that she told the driver to drive slow, but he didn't listen. So I knew by then that she was his friend, I held her and told her that everything will be ok, they are trying to get him out, the cops are on the way too. I was shaking but I know that if I don't remain calm it will scare her even more.  Later the cops were asking us about the details of the accident, so she was there looking at the car and waiting for them to get the driver out. We were done doing the report and was ready to leave, she asked for the contact information she said she will pay us, but we said everyone under that situation would do the same thing and we don't need any reward or pay. We were just doing what normal people would do. We told her we hope her friend recovers soon and then we left.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_check([16], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 17 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'there'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "there", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 16th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [16]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([16], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([16], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(16, \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(16, \"unchange\")"]}}}

I got a new battery, replaced it, and it still wouldn't start. I had several friends come look at it for me to try and fix it because I don't have much money and knew it would be expensive to fix. Fortunately, I had a good friend that I also work with, who was willing to let me ride with her to work every day for a week and then let me borrow her car at night so that I could do other things like go to the store and the gym. One day during the week my car was broken, I got a text from my brother, saying he was coming to visit me on Saturday to bring me something. My birthday had just passed and he lives in another city about an hour and a half away so I thought he was bringing my nephew to visit me since I don't get to see him much. My brother has never randomly visited me so I was excited that he was coming. Meanwhile, during that week, my dad reached out to me and offered to pay to have my car fixed. This meant a lot to me because my relationship with me parents has been strained lately and we hadn't spoken much. Saturday came around, and my brother text me to let me know that he and my dad were both headed to visit me. My dad had a flight out of the airport near me that day so they came into town early so that the three of us could eat lunch together. When they arrived to pick me up, my brother handed me a small gift, wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper with a bow on it, and told me I couldn't open it until he left. I agreed, and we all went to eat lunch together. Once we finished eating, my dad offered to let me drive his truck until my car got fixed since it would be parked at the airport all week anyway. I appreciated that he trusted me to drive his truck while he was gone. So, I had a vehicle to drive for the next week and headed home after work feeling very grateful. At home, I opened the gift my brother gave to me. It was a small box that belonged to my grandmother before she passed away, and he included $1000 in cash inside. I immediately started sobbing. My brother has had a hard life and struggled for a long time. He battled drug addiction and has been clean for several years now. He worked incredibly hard and supports a wife and 3 kids. I called him and told him that no one had ever done something like that for me and that I would never ever forget it.

I loved to wake her up early in the morning and sing her Happy Birthday before the sun had even started to peek over the horizon. \t  Being only August though the countdown for her birthday had not yet begun so my mom decided to try and beat it and get my sisters birthday shopping done early. So one Saturday morning my mom and I went to the mall to shop for my sister. We were at a store shopping for my sister when I saw a bright yellow advertising sign hanging from the ceiling which was an advertisement for Payless, that just happened to be on the opposite end of the mall from where we were. On the sign, there were the coolest slippers I had ever seen. They were massaging slippers in the shape of animals particularly the one on the sign was a pink unicorn. The slippers themselves were pink which made them even greater because that is her favorite color. As soon as I saw these breathtaking slippers I tugged on my mothers' sleeve and pointed at the sign. Without the slightest bit of interest she just merely glanced up at the sign and went back to what she was looking at, so I had kept my eye on that sign for the entire time we were in the store, not acknowledging a word my mom said to me the rest of the time. After my mother had finished and rung her gifts out I tugged on her arm to get her attention and said I had to go across the mall that I would meet her at the car. I hadn't told her what store I was going to or for what but she walked out the exit doors of the mall and I continued on my way to Payless. When I got there I looked around the store feverishly and still couldn't find the slippers I was looking for so I stopped an employee and asked her where they were. She pointed me in the direction of the far back of the store so I took off for that corner and when I got there I saw a pile of boxes with unicorn heads sticking out of them. So then I looked through the boxes for her size and when I found them I brought them up and paid for them and ran to the mall exit hoping I hadn't detained my mother in the car for too long. When I got there she had asked me what was in the bag and I showed her, she smirked and burst out laughing and offended I asked her what was so funny because I knew my sister would love them. She smiled and explained that my other sister had bought her a massaging neck warmer that was in the shape of a unicorn and was pink and she said that only sisters could pick out a perfect pair without even knowing what the other had  gotten.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_check([10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [10]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([10], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 18 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 440 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 440}, "function_call": "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 25 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 25}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.5714285714285714}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"unicorn\", 1, \"equal\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"unicorn\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(10, \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"unicorn\", 2, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"pink\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"payless\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(17, \"less than\")"]}}}

One standard tool for recognition in low resource languages is multilingual acoustic modeling [2]. Acoustic models are generally trained on parallel data of speech waveforms and phoneme transcriptions. Importantly, phonemes are perceptual units of sound that closely correlate with, but do not exactly correspond to the actual sounds that are spoken, phones. An example of this is shown in Figure 1, which demonstrates two English words that share the same phoneme /p/, but different in the actual phonetic realizations [p] and [ph]. Allophones, 1A web demo is available at  the pretrained model will be released at  allosaurus ENGLISH peak speak MANDARIN CHINESE ping bing /pik/ /spik/ [phik] [spik] \u2018level\u2019 /phiN/ [phiN] \u2018ice\u2019 /piN/ [piN] Fig. 1: Words, phonemes (slashes), and phones (square brackets). the sets of phones that correspond to a particular phoneme, are language speci\ufb01c; distinctions that are important in some languages are not important in others. Most multilingual acoustic models simply use existing phoneme transcriptions as-is, taking the union of the phoneme sets to be shared by all training languages [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The assumption is reasonable under some circumstances as phoneme names are typically associated with their most common or least marked allophone. However, this is obviously an over-simplistic view: in Figure 1, for example, this would mean that all training in English would assign the phones [p] and [ph] to phoneme /p/. This is detrimental if we want to recognize Mandarin Chinese, for instance, where the two phones are corresponding to two distinctive phonemes /p/ and /ph/. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multilingual recognition based on phonetic annotation to tackle this problem: Allosaurus (allophone system of automatic recognition for universal speech). Our method incorporates knowledge of phonology into the multilingual model through an allophone layer, which associates a universal narrow phone set with the phonemes that appear in the transcription of each language. Our model \ufb01rst computes the phone distribution using a standard ASR encoder, then the allophone layer maps the phone distribution into the phoneme distribution for each language. This model can be trained end-to-end using only standard phonemic transcriptions and an allophone list created by phoneticians. The allophone layer is \ufb01rst initialized with the allophone list, then is further optimized during the training process. We demonstrate that accounting for the phoneme-phone mismatch in this way improves the accuracy of multilingual acoustic modeling by 2.0% phoneme error rate in low-resource conditions. Furthermore, the architecture simultaneously makes it possible to perform universal phone recognition.

Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight.   Carbon-fiber: The gold standard for light-weight bikes, carbon fiber is unfortunately a bit brittle. You will quite often see it on mountain bikes as the technology has progressed over the years so be careful if you decide to buy a second-hand carbon bike. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber.  Titanium: Titanium is another high-end option that has the same stiffness as steel but it\u2019s not as dense. Titanium is often found on mountain and road bikes.  Aluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the most common frames you can buy for any bike. They can be made as light as steel but will not be as light as carbon fiber.  Steel: Sturdy but heavy, steel is most common on old bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights. However, some custom steel bikes might still be under 20\u00a0lb (9.1\u00a0kg). Perhaps the best \"bang for your buck\" fix is to get lighter wheels. You will not only lose weight, but you'll also become remarkably more aerodynamic. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an \"upgrade\" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes:  Steel or carbon-fiber wheels Tubular wheels, not recommended for anything other than racing as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace. Aero wheels Mountain bike tires, which are big and knobby, are going to kill you going up a paved hill. If you find yourself riding more roads than trails, purchase a set of commuter or \"cross\" tires, which are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding. Slicks are also a viable choice for light trails such as footpaths. Look at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a \"compact crank,\" which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have fewer gears to work with, you will lose weight. If still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. That said, many riders find that, after 1-2 weeks of riding a compact crank, they forget they ever had a third ring. Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathlon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle so if you crash, be sure to get it checked at your local bike shop. There are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city.  If you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race. These will only shave a few grams off your total weight -- hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that will protect you on busy roads. While this is mostly for racers, lighter,  shoes and aero helmets cut down weight keep you quick, and look professional. They can get expensive, however. You can also swap out your pedals for racing pedals and wear light-weight shoes that attach to them. Not for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can. Professional rider Jack Pullar is perhaps the most extreme example, as he ripped off the seat covering and drilled holes out of his saddle, then sawed off the bottoms of his handlebars, to lose weight. While you should be careful, some race modifications include:  Sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set. Leave at least 2\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (6.4\u00a0cm) of the seat post in the seat tube or else you could damage your frame. Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings. Removing water cages and bolts. Unless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11lb bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter group set (your gears) and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 of an iPhone 4. You will not notice the difference. If you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get. Otherwise, stick to a few bigger, cost-effective fixes and work on getting stronger legs, not a lighter bike.  If you've got nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, get a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first. They won't make a huge difference, but they will make the bike lighter.

Last weekend was particularly brutal. We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter. I have seen occasional things that seemed to trigger some anxiety, but not like this. I think it may have been the sound of the fire and the intense warmth in the beginning. I picked her up like a baby and held her in my arms and sat on the couch. She was a bit uneasy, at first, but talking to her and taking occasional bites from my bowl of chili, she seemed to calm down and she looked up at me, with a knowing look in her eyes and I felt her tail wagging ever so slightly. I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand. As soon as I put my spoon in the empty bowl, she jumped up and licked a bit of chili off my chin, I had dribbled, and then didn't stop there. She licked my face all over. I had not seen her that happy since I walked through the door earlier. She, eventually, calmed down and curled up under my arm and we both drifted off to sleep.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_check([15, 18], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 15th, and 18th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15, 18]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([15, 18], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 380}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'that'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "that", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 18], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"that\", 1, \"equal\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection(\"that\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15, 18], \"unchange\")"]}}}

In this task, we are given two sentences which are respectively called premise and hypothesis. The goal is to determine whether the logical relationship between them is entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Recently, performance on NLI(Chen et al., 2017b; Gong et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017c) \u2217 Premise: A soccer game with multiple males playing. Hypothesis: Some men are playing a sport. Label: Entailment Premise: An older and younger man smiling. Hypothesis: Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the \ufb02oor. Label: Neutral Premise: A black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people Hypothesis: A man is driving down a lonely road. Label: Contradiction Table 1: Three examples in SNLI dataset. has been signi\ufb01cantly boosted since the release of some high quality large-scale benchmark datasets such as SNLI(Bowman et al., 2015) and MultiNLI(Williams et al., 2017). Table 1 shows some examples in SNLI. Most state-of-the-art works focus on the interaction architectures between the premise and the hypothesis, while they rarely concerned the discourse relations of the sentences, which is a core issue in natural language understanding. People usually use some certain set of words to express the discourse relation between two sentences1. These words, such as \u201cbut\u201d or \u201cand\u201d, are denoted as discourse markers. These discourse markers have deep connections with the intrinsic relations of two sentences and intuitively correspond to the intent of NLI, such as \u201cbut\u201d to \u201ccontradiction\u201d, \u201cso\u201d to \u201centailment\u201d, etc. Very few NLI works utilize this information revealed by discourse markers. Nie et al. (2017) proposed to use discourse markers to help rep1Here sentences mean either the whole sentences or the main clauses of a compound sentence. 12 l u J 2 ] L C . s c [ v99.01 : v i X r a             \fresent the meanings of the sentences. However, they represent each sentence by a single vector and directly concatenate them to predict the answer, which is too simple and not ideal for the largescale datasets. In this paper, we propose a Discourse Marker Augmented Network for natural language inference, where we transfer the knowledge from the existing supervised task: Discourse Marker Prediction (DMP)(Nie et al., 2017), to an integrated NLI model. We \ufb01rst propose a sentence encoder model that learns the representations of the sentences from the DMP task and then inject the encoder to the NLI network. Moreover, because our NLI datasets are manually annotated, each example from the datasets might get several different labels from the annotators although they will \ufb01nally come to a consensus and also provide a certain label. In consideration of that different con\ufb01dence level of the \ufb01nal labels should be discriminated, we employ reinforcement learning with a reward de\ufb01ned by the uniformity extent of the original labels to train the model. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. \u2022 Unlike previous studies, we solve the task of the natural language inference via transferring knowledge from another supervised task. We propose the Discourse Marker Augmented Network to combine the learned encoder of the sentences with the integrated NLI model. \u2022 According to the property of the datasets, we incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize a new objective function to make full use of the labels\u2019 information. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets to show that our method achieves better performance than other stateof-the-art solutions to the problem.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the word 'task'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "task", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 31 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 31}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 2th, and 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [2, 21]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 23 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.6, "simpo": 0.5454545454545454, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter3": 0.6, "base": 0.4000000000000001}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"task\", 1, \"equal\")", "sentence_modification_check([1, 21], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["word_count_check(1000, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"second sentence\", \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"twenty-first sentence\", \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(31, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(23, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"task\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([2, 21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(30, \"less than\")"]}}}

The cancer was in an area that could not be operated on so her only options were chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Since she already suffers from Fibromyalgia we knew it was going to be very hard on her. On the first day of radiation the doctor decided to wait a few days to start the chemo treatment as both in one day would be too much for her. When the day came we went to the infusion center and she was hooked up for about 4 hours but had to take a chemo bag with her that pumped the chemicals into her body 24 hours per day. She started on a Monday and by Wednesday she was so sick she couldn't get out of bed. As the day progressed she started getting confused and couldn't even finish a sentence. I decided she had to go to the hospital and I thought I could help her out of bed and downstairs and into the car but I found that she was in so much pain I couldn't touch her anywhere without her screaming. I called 911 for an ambulance and while waiting for them her condition worsened. They arrived in about 10 minutes and I tried to move as many things out of the way as I could so they could get the gurney down our two half flights of stairs. There were 4 of them and it took all of us to get her on the gurney, because she was screaming in pain and delirious. I was trying to stay calm but this all happened so suddenly I completely forgot about our little girl. I had block her off in the den while the paramedics were there as that was the first thing they requested so no animals would be in the way or get hurt. Once they had her in the ambulance they asked where I wanted her to be taken and if I needed to ride in the front of the ambulance. There said insurance restrictions prevented me from riding in the back with her. I said I would follow them in my car, not knowing how long I would be there. As they drove away I thought of all the things I had to do while at the same time thinking and worrying about my wife. A neighbor who I did not know and who lives 2 doors away was standing outside watching. For a brief second I was a bit annoyed at them watching a \"show\" and I was becoming a bir frantic trying to figure out everything I had to do even before getting in my car and driving to the hospital so I could be with my sweetheart. I heard this soft voice saying \"sir\", \"sir\" and I turned around to see this neighbor trying to get my attention. I thought she might want to know what was going on but she softly said \"if there's anything I can do for you let me know\". I asked her if there was any way she could watch our 4 month old puppy and she said she would be glad to. I quickly brought her kennel and food over, locked the house and drove to the hospital, calling everyone that needed to be told , on the way. It was a day I'll never forget but we got through it and my wife is on her way to being cancer free, for the second time.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_check([19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "text_eval()"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 27 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 27}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'there'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "there", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [19]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 19 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 19}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter4": 0.888888888888889, "sft": 0.4444444444444445, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "base": 0.6}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(26, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(18, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(19, \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "word_count_check(27, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"there\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"infusion\", 1, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(19, \"less than\")"]}}}

My dad had sent me a text message asking me to call him as soon as I could because it was important. My Maw Maw had been having a lot of health issues lately so I knew the call had to be about her. Even though she had been doing a lot better and in rehab I still got that feeling that it was about her. Sure enough my dad told me my Maw Maw had passed away early that morning. My heart pretty much broke in half when I heard those words. My Maw Maw was the best person I have ever met. She was loving to everyone and always put others before herself. She was married to my Paw Paw for over 50 years and he had passed 4 years prior to this so after he passed her health started going more down hill. She never smoked a day in her life or drank so I will always question why she was taken so soon and  young from me but I know she hadn't been the same since my Paw Paw passed, he was her rock and she loved him with all her heart. After I got the call I started searching for flights immediately. I had planned to fly out a week and a half later anyways but had to move up  my flight to get out there for the funeral. I ended up getting a flight for 2 days later and my mom was planning the funeral for that Friday, I flew out early Tuesday morning. It was nice to get home to family sooner than I had thought I would and see everyone but a very important person was missing.  My oldest son is 8 and he was pretty heart broken too knowing he wouldn't see her again. He was stronger than me though and able to look at her at the viewing and tell her goodbye. That stuff is hard for me, seeing a dead body and the person not being inside of it anymore. The viewing and funeral went very well though. It felt very rushed because her house was also set to close before she passed so we had to clean it out fast for the new owners to move in and throwing stuff away then trying to find a place for the rest was hard. I don't like just throwing her stuff away but we were pushed on time and really had no choice. My parents live in Georgia, me in Texas and Maw Maw lived in North Carolina so not really anywhere to put stuff other than my uncle's house which he has a lot in his garage now.

There are seven chakras, and each corresponds to a different part of your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Your third eye chakra is the sixth chakra.  The third eye chakra is located at the forefront of your brain, between your two eyes. It is right above the bridge of your nose. When you meditate, try to focus your mind on this chakra. It is responsible for helping you to see the world more clearly. Meditation is one of the most effective tools for helping you to open your third eye. By bringing more awareness to your thoughts, you will be able to better access the mental clarity that is associated with the third eye. The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object. It is important to choose surroundings where you feel comfortable when you are beginning to meditate.  Some people feel more peaceful and open-minded when they are out in nature. If this sounds like you, you might consider meditating outdoors. Find a space that is the right temperature and where you can sit without being disturbed by others. Indoor meditation is also perfectly fine. Many people have a designated meditation space in their home. This generally includes a cushion that makes it more comfortable to sit on the floor, and perhaps some candles and soothing music. Remember that meditation is a very personal process. You should choose the surroundings that are right for you. The mind-body connection is very important in meditation. The more comfortable you are physically, the easier it will be to focus on you meditation object or thought. The most effective meditation posture is generally thought to be some variation of sitting cross-legged on the ground.  If you are used to sitting in a chair, take some time each day to get used to sitting on the floor. In time, it will feel more natural it will be easier to focus on your meditation. Most people choose to use at least one cushion to make sitting on the ground more comfortable. Feel free to use two or three sturdy cushions if you find this works better for you. If you simply cannot be comfortable sitting, don't worry. You can try what is known as walking meditation. For some people, the rhythmic sounds of their footfalls can be very soothing. Walk slowly, and have a clear path so that you don't have to think too much about where you are going. A meditation object can be a thought or a physical object. The point of choosing one is to make it easier for your brain to focus. This will keep your thoughts from wandering and will make your meditation more effective.  Candles are a popular meditation object. The flickering flame is easy to look at and are comforting to many people. Your meditation object does not have to be nearby physically. Feel free to picture the ocean or a beautiful tree that you once saw. Just make sure you can clearly see the object in your mind's eye. A mantra is a word or phrase that you will repeat during your meditation practice. You might say the mantra internally or out loud--that is a personal preference. Your mantra should be something that is personal and meaningful to you.  Your mantra should be something that you want to integrate into your mind, or your awareness. For example, you might choose to repeat, \"I choose happiness\". This will help reinforce the idea that you are going to focus on feeling joy throughout the day. Another mantra idea is to choose just one word. For example, you could repeat the word \"peace\". Meditation is a practice. That means that the first time to sit down to meditate, it might not be a big success. Your mind might wander, or you might even fall asleep. Learning to successfully meditate is a process and it takes time. Make meditation a part of your every day life. Begin with very small increments, maybe five minutes or even just two. Soon you will feel more comfortable with the process and be able to devote more time to meditation each day.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\"); word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object.\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 34 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 34}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 500 tokens and more than 480 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 500, "min_cnt": 480}, "function_call": "word_count_check(500, \"less than\"); word_count_check(480, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 10th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [10]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 23 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 23}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "gpt4o": 0.8, "base": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.8}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object.\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([10], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object.\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(480, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"the 10th sentence must remain unchanged.\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(23, \"less than\")"]}}}

We're supposed to be looking out for the common good and having everyone's best interests at heart. Heads up: being selfish and caring for others aren't mutually exclusive. You can still be the best person you can possibly be and be selfish and make others happy.  Selfishness is not using others, or making them serve you, or removing yourself from people. Selfishness is being primarily interested in your own goals. Selfishness has everything to do with other people - a selfish person who hurts others does so unknowingly or possibly knowingly, but is never in the habit of considering how their selfish actions may hurt others. A selfish person is concerned with their self, and in rare cases has a need to hurt others. With the possible exception of your parents, no one else is looking out for you (and your parents may get it wrong sometimes, even if they have good intentions). That means that you are the only one really on your side -- so it's your job to put you first! That's not being selfish -- it's being logical. Before you can go about acting in your own self interest, you have to figure out just who your self really is. If spending hours on end each day telling the world to shove it and becoming a recluse in your home wouldn't make you happy, there's no point in being selfish and doing it. If you're gonna be selfish, do it right! What makes you happy? What makes you tick? Are you the person you want to be right now? Are you a people pleaser? A doormat? Bossy? Your disposition going into this process will determine your behavior. It's only the stuff that matters that you need to be selfish on! The rest can be handled depending on your mood. Maybe that day you'll feel particularly giving and willing to make a self-sacrifice. But if, say, you're desperately trying to save money for a new computer and your friend asks to crash on your couch and eat your food for a week, that's where you draw the line. Priorities! Life is a series of compromises. You won't be selfish about everything, but you should be selfish on what would make you the best person you can be. If you don't want to sacrifice your health, money, time, or possessions, think about whether or not they're that important to you. Are you fulfilled by them? If so, put your foot down. If not, reconsider. Another part of maximizing your rationale when it comes to being selfish is identifying what's stopping you from where you want to be. It's all fine and good to take the last chip at the party table (just don't do it twice), but it's the real stuff we're talking about here. What's keeping you from being happy? That stuff needs to be gotten rid of, even if it's at the expense of others. If a person or thing or place isn't jiving with you, ditch it. Your boyfriend is moving to New York and you have a sweet gig lined up in California? Your mom wants you to stay at home and become a kindergarten teacher? Your best friend thinks you two should get matching haircuts? You know what would make you happy; you know what you would regret for the rest of your life. Do things for yourself -- not because other people want them. Numerous studies show that being selfish can actually lead to us feeling happy -- so long as we don't feel guilty about it. And most of the time, we shouldn't. If we're only being selfish about what truly matters to us, only being selfish to create our best selves, then there's nothing to feel guilty about. Case closed.

Each sentence must contain fewer than 16 tokens:\n\nIt's fairly easy to change your shirt quickly without exposing yourself for too long. To begin, sit down on a bench with your gym shirt on your lap (with the front of your shirt facing down and the neck of the shirt towards your knees).  You can also perform this move while standing up in front of your locker, if you have one. Your open locker door can shield part of your body: Instead of placing your shirt on your lap, have it placed in the bottom of your locker ready to go for the following steps. Pull your arms out of your shirt. If your shirt is a pull-over style, remove your arms, but don't take the shirt all the way off. Keep your head in the neck opening of the shirt, with the shirt draped over your body. (If you are wearing a button-down style shirt, unbutton your shirt completely and take your arms out, but leave the shirt draped over your shoulders.) Place your hands up through bottom opening of your gym shirt and into the arms. Then raise your arms and lift your old shirt off as you slip the new one over your head. Your shirt should fall behind you as you raise your arms. If you want to draw as little attention to yourself as possible when changing out of your street pants, try this quick change hack. Begin by having your gym pants ready beside you on a bench (right-side out, with drawstrings loosened, etc.). Make sure that your shoes are off as well, before you get started.  Loosen your regular clothes (unbutton, unzip, or unfasten your jeans, pants, or skirt) and begin to slide them down. Sit down once you've lowered them past your hips. This will minimize the amount of time you are standing up with your underwear exposed. Once you are sitting, slide your bottoms past your knees and down off your feet. While you are still bent over, reach over and grab your gym pants/shorts, and step into them. Pull your gym pants up to your knees while you remain sitting down, and then stand up to quickly slide them over your hips. You can also try pulling your gym pants up while sitting down instead of standing: push down with your legs while sitting so that your hips are raised off the bench, and pull up your gym pants. It's a good idea to change into fresh underwear after gym class. If you choose to do so, the procedure is basically the same as changing your pants (explained above.)  Begin by having your underwear ready next to you. You don't want to be searching through your gym bag for your clean pair after you've removed your dirty pair. Loosen your gym pants, and then slide them down along with your underwear.  Sit down once they are past your hips. Step out of your dirty clothes, grab your fresh underwear and step into them. Once your feet are both through the opening, slide them up quickly. You should be able to slide your underwear up and over your hips while sitting down without having to stand all the way up. It's probably best if you leave your shirt on while you do this\u2014you'll feel less exposed. You can also drape a towel over your lap while you are changing your underwear. If you need to wear a sports bra for gym class, you could just wear one to school and not change. However, this may not be comfortable all day, or it may not look right in your streets clothes. If that's the case, it's fairly easy to change in the locker room without drawing too much attention to yourself. Begin by removing your shirt and putting your sports bra on over your regular bra.  Then reach under the sports bra to unhook your regular bra. Slide the right bra strap out over your shoulder and pull your arm out. Repeat on the left side, and then remove your regular bra by pulling it out from the front (reach under your sports bra and pull your regular bra out). Have your shirt ready to slip on quickly once you're done with this. It's probably a bit too hard to do this with a shirt on, though you could practice at home to see if it's possible.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_check([21], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 34 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 34}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 21th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [21]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([21], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 16 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 16}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333334, "base": 0.5}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(34, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(35, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"change\", 2, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([21], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Water flushes out your system, removing unneeded toxins, making it easier to lose weight. Moreover, water is free of calories, making it a much better choice than sugary drinks. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only water, your odds of losing the weight will increase. If you need something flavored from time to time, choose unsweetened tea.  This should be 24/7, apart from right before a workout. Then you can feel free to chug a cup of black coffee (or with a splash of skim milk). The caffeine blast is reported to give you a kick, making you work out a little bit harder.  It turns out drinking water can up your metabolism, too, in addition to making you feel full. Recent studies show that drinking two glasses of cold water can up your metabolism about 40% for 15-20 minutes. Participants in these weight loss studies reportedly lost 15 pounds in three months, largely by drinking only water. Cut it out completely. Someone following a standard diet can usually afford to fall off the junk food wagon once or twice without suffering major repercussions. For more extreme, short-term weight loss goals (like this one), however, junk food must be completely avoided.  Stay away from greasy, fatty foods as well as those with a high sugar content. Anything battered, fried, covered in chocolate, packaged, or loaded up and preserved with sugar is a no-go. Be sure to read your labels. Even things like yogurt and granola bars can be powerhouses of sugar. While many people think of these as healthy, they're actually not. Everything from pasta to cookies is full of simple carbohydrates that are actually sugars in disguise. These little villains spike our insulin levels, upping our fat stores, and ultimately increase our body weight. To lower the spike, cut out the processed carbs \u2013 that means white rice, bread, and potatoes, in addition to cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream.  You may be better off cutting out carbs in general. Let's face it: 20 pounds in 2 weeks is a tall order. To put your body in ketosis, where it's feeding off your fat stores and not your glycogen stores (because those have been depleted), you'll have to go completely low or no carb. In addition to no sweets, you'll have to cut out starchy vegetables (potatoes, squash, carrots), whole grains (including quinoa and brown rice) and sugary fruits, like bananas, oranges, and apples. What's more, being hungry makes the temptation to cave to your old habits all the more powerful. Consistently eating good-for-you, healthy foods keeps the other cravings at bay. When you're more full, you make better decisions. Whether or not negative calorie foods are truly negative is up for debate. As the theory goes, some foods take so much energy to digest that eating them actually burns more calories than the foods contain. Even if you do not burn calories eating these foods, though, you will not gain many calories from them, either.  In the way of vegetables, eat more asparagus, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. As for fruits, gravitate toward blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon. Instead of beef and pork, opt for leaner meats like chicken or fish. Consuming fish is especially helpful because the fatty acids in fish give your body the beneficial oils it needs, and may help subdue the urge to consume greasy or fattening foods. And as for vegetables, go for it. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner \u2013 pile 'em on. They're nutritious, generally not full of calories or sugars (again, no potatoes), and keep you full. They're the shortest track to losing weight there is. . The fact of the matter is that in the short term, fad diets can work. If you're looking to lose weight very quickly and don't care if you gain it back, then a fad diet could be okay for you in this situation. Just realize that, in general, they're not healthy and their effects do not last for long. One of the most common fad diets right now is juicing. Another contender is the Master Cleanse diet \u2013 both of which are liquid-based diets. These offer quick results, but are hard to adhere to and are not wise to stay on for long.

You could go for a 15-minute brisk walk during your lunch break, then walk or jog around your neighborhood for 15 minutes after dinner.  If you\u2019re elderly or have a history of joint issues, jogging may be tough on your knees, hips, and ankles. Respect your body\u2019s limits and, if necessary, stick to walking. for 5 to 15 minutes. More than just a fun game for kids, jumping rope is an excellent cardio workout. Grab a rope, and try jumping for 5 minutes straight. If you\u2019re not used to exercising, it\u2019s okay if you can only jump for a minute or so. If you need to stop, take a break and catch your breath. Try jumping rope for gradually longer periods of time. You could aim to add 30 seconds or a minute to your time each week until you can jump for at least 5 minutes straight. for 5 to 15 minutes. Start by standing with your legs together and arms at your side. Then jump straight up as you move your legs outward and raise your arms together above your head. Return to the starting position, then repeat. As with jumping rope, take a break if you feel too winded, and try to gradually increase the length of time you can do jumping jacks. When you\u2019re just starting off, go for easy bike rides around your neighborhood, on a local bike trail, or at a park. At first, try cycling for around 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) in 30 minutes, then gradually increase your speed and distance. As you get used to being active, try to work your way up to 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) in 30 minutes. Eventually, aim to cover 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) in 15 minutes. laps at your local pool or fitness center. Swimming is a great full body workout, and it can help add variety to your routine. Try swimming laps for 20 minutes, or for as long as you can without getting too winded. It\u2019s okay if you need to take a break, especially when you\u2019re just getting used to exercising.  In addition to swimming laps, you could do water aerobics or just walk around in a pool. These are good options for people with joint problems or those who are significantly overweight. Go for runs around your neighborhood, or look for a local indoor or outdoor track. Try to run for 15 to 30 minutes straight, but don\u2019t push yourself too hard if you\u2019re just starting to get more active.  Each week, try to add another minute to your running time. Eventually, see if you can run 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) straight, track your time, and try to cut down your time each time you run. Running might be tough on your legs if you\u2019re elderly or have a history of bone or joint issues. Remember to respect your body\u2019s limits. Interval training involves alternating high-intensity and low-intensity exercises, and it\u2019s a great way to burn calories. Since it involves high-intensity activities, such as running or sprinting, it's best to include interval training in your routine if you're already used to regular exercise. For a good, basic interval session, try doing a sprint-walk routine. Warm up by walking briskly for 5 to 10 minutes, then jog for 5 to 10 minutes. After jogging, sprint for 30 to 60 seconds, then jog for 5 minutes. Alternate running for 30 to 60 seconds with 5 minutes of jogging at least 2 to 3 times, then cool down by walking for 5 to 10 minutes.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\"); word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "sentence_check([34], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"34th sentence\", \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain more than 29 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 24 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 580 tokens and more than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 580, "min_cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(580, \"less than\"); word_count_check(560, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 34th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [34]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([34], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.3636363636363636, "simpo": 0.7692307692307692, "simpo_iter2": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.3636363636363636}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([34], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"34th sentence\", \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([34], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"34th sentence\", \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"34th sentence.\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"34th\", \"remove\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(30, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([34], \"unchange\")"]}}}

This means that the price of the bond is more than the face value, or par value of the bond.  This is how investors compensate for the difference between the coupon rate and the market rate.  For example, Company XYZ issues 5-year, $500,000, 10 percent bonds, with interest paid semi-annually.  The market interest rate is 8 percent, so the bond must be issued at a premium. The bond selling price equals the present value of the principal + the present value of the interest payments.  The premium is the difference between the selling price and the face value of the bond.  Interest is paid semi-annually, so the coupon rate per period is 5 percent (10 percent / 2) and the market interest rate per period is 4 percent (8 percent / 2). The number of periods is 10 (2 periods per year * 5 years). The coupon payment per period is $25,000 ($500,000 *.05). Calculate the present value of the principal.  Multiply the face value of the bond by the present value interest factor (PVIF).  Calculate PVIF with the formula 1/(1+r)t{\\displaystyle 1/(1+r)^{t}}, where r = the market interest rate per period and t = the number of periods.  PVIF=1/(1+.04)10=0.6756{\\displaystyle PVIF=1/(1+.04)^{1}0=0.6756} Present value of the principal = $500,000\u22170.6756=$337,800{\\displaystyle \\$500,000*0.6756=\\$337,800}  Calculate the present value of the interest payments by multiplying the amount of the coupon payment by the present value factor for an ordinary annuity (PVOA).  Calculate PVOA with the formula (1\u2212(1/(1+r)t))/r{\\displaystyle (1-(1/(1+r)^{t}))/r}, where r = the market interest rate per period and t = the number of periods. PVOA=(1\u2212(1/(1+.04)10))/.06=8.1109{\\displaystyle PVOA=(1-(1/(1+.04)^{10}))/.06=8.1109} Multiply the amount of the coupon payment by the PVOA to get the present value of the interest.  $25,000\u22178.1109=$202,773{\\displaystyle \\$25,000*8.1109=\\$202,773}. The selling price of the bond = the present value of the principal + the present value of the interest. $337,800+$202,773=$540,573{\\displaystyle \\$337,800+\\$202,773=\\$540,573} The premium is $540,573\u2212$500,000=$40,573{\\displaystyle \\$540,573-\\$500,000=\\$40,573} The interest payment for each period is the amount the investor receives each period.  This is the coupon payment * the face value of the bond.  Using the above example, the coupon payment per period is 5 percent (10 percent / 2 payments per year = 5 percent).  The face value of the bond is $500,000.   $500,000\u2217.05=$25,000{\\displaystyle \\$500,000*.05=\\$25,000}. The interest payment per period is $25,000. Since you sold the bond at a premium, the effective interest rate you are paying on the bond equals the market interest rate at the time you issued the bond.  The total interest expense is the present value of the bond * the effective interest rate.  This gets recalculated every period.  Using the above example, the present value of the bond on the date if issue is $540,573. The total interest expense is the present value * the effective interest rate per period. $540,573\u2217.04=$21,623{\\displaystyle \\$540,573*.04=\\$21,623} Because you issued the bond at a premium, you paid an effective interest amount of $21,623.  However, you have to separate out the amount of interest paid to investors and the amortization of the premium on your monthly financial statements.  The total effective interest expense is $21,623.  The coupon payment to investors is $25,000.  The amortization expense of the premium for this period is $25,000\u221221,623=$3,377{\\displaystyle \\$25,000-21,623=\\$3,377}. On your financial statement for this month, record a debit of $21,623 to interest expense, a debit of $3,377 to Premium on Bonds Payable and a credit of $25,000 to Cash. Now you need to recalculate the present value of the bond.  This will be the beginning present value of the bond from this period less the amortization recorded for this period.  You will use the ending present value from this period as the beginning present value for the next period when you recalculate the total interest expense.  The beginning present value for the period was $540,573.  The amortization of the discount for this period was $3,377. The ending present value for the period is $540,573\u2212$3,3777=$537,196{\\displaystyle \\$540,573-\\$3,3777=\\$537,196}. Use $537,196 as the beginning present value when calculating the total effective interest expense for the next period.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(580, \"less than\"); word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 580 tokens and more than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 580, "min_cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(580, \"less than\"); word_count_check(560, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 33 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 33 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 14th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [14]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([14], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.1818181818181818, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.6, "simpo": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter2": 0.5, "simpo_iter3": 0.7692307692307692, "base": 0.3636363636363636}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["word_count_check(580, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"the\", 100, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([13], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(580, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"bond\", 5, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([14], \"unchange\")"]}}}

However, some may charge a small fee for a consultation. Make certain that you know whether you will be charged, and don't make an appointment with an attorney who isn't forthcoming about these details.  Most attorneys offer consultations for free. Start your search with these before you consult with an attorney who charges for initial consultations. If you do not live in the same state as the attorney, you can schedule a phone consultation instead of an in-person meeting. However, because you will usually want your attorney to appear with you in court, you should try to find a local attorney to represent you. You can generally find out the basic information about the attorney online, such as how long s/he has been practicing, where s/he went to law school, etc. For your in-person questions, ask about matters that are relevant to your specific case. The attorney should not have any problem answering any questions you may have, and should not sound hesitant or unsure.  Areas to ask about include questions about the following:   Pricing. You should ask whether the attorney offers hourly pricing or flat fees? Flat fee pricing is very popular for many areas of practice, particularly things like family law.  Delivery time for legal work. You should ask how quickly you can expect for the attorney to complete your legal project. Your attorney will likely not be able to give you an exact number, but s/he should be able to tell you how long previous, similar cases have taken and when you can likely expect a resolution.  Success rate. You will probably want to ask what the attorney\u2019s track record is with cases like yours. Attorneys cannot guarantee an outcome (they are ethically forbidden to do so) but you should have an idea of what results you can reasonably expect. You can also ask for references from prior clients. Be aware that the attorney must obtain permission from prior clients before s/he can give you their information, so you may not get references immediately.  Availability. You should ask how quickly the attorney can start. You should also ask who your primary contact throughout the case will be. Will you hear mostly from an assistant or junior colleague? You should know who to contact with questions about your case.  Misconduct. If the attorney has misconduct or reprimands on his or her record \u2013 which you can find out at your state\u2019s bar association website \u2013 ask about them. In some cases, the infraction may be minor, such as failure to pay bar fees on time. You must decide whether the infraction is significant enough to disturb you. The lawyer may ask you to bring certain documents, but you should also bring any that you think are important to the case. Gather these documents ahead of time to be sure that you can locate them on the day of the appointment. Meet with, or talk to, each of the lawyers you selected. Feel free to take notes while talking to each one, so that you can remember later what each attorney said and what your initial impressions were. Remember that you are interviewing the attorney for a job. Treat your meeting as such, a job interview. If you feel as though the attorney isn't listening to you or isn't answering your questions, pick a different attorney. Aside from experience and strong knowledge of the law, choose an attorney who you think that you would get along with and like working with.  If the attorney makes you uncomfortable in any way, you should choose someone different to represent you. Also consider how well the attorney answered your questions. If s/he hesitated, used too much \"legalese,\" or didn't attend to your needs, pick someone else. If more than one attorney has the qualifications you are looking for, you should choose the one that you feel the most comfortable with.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(380, \"less than\"); word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 380 tokens and more than 360 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 380, "min_cnt": 360}, "function_call": "word_count_check(380, \"less than\"); word_count_check(360, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 7 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 7}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 17th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [17]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([17], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo": 0.5, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.9090909090909091, "base": 0.3333333333333333}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(370, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check(17, \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"17th sentence must remain unchanged:\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(380, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(7, \"more than\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(25, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(360, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"consultation\", 3, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Here's the revised text:\n\nPolish the text to enhance its fluency. Ensure the output has fewer than 420 tokens but more than 400. Each sentence should have fewer than 15 tokens. Avoid using the word 'feel'. Retain the 17th and 26th sentences without alteration:\n\n. Breathing deeply, from your diaphragm, can actually reduce the amount of stress that your body feels. Calmly count to ten, slowly. Imagine yourself on the beach. Let the internal sound of waves and seagulls wash over you. Feel the mist of the seawater on your face and let it calm you. Channel your most calming memory of experience; the feeling of a loved one, the memory of success, the bliss of no responsibility. This step is all about managing expectations. Too often, we have very specific ideas of how people should act and what people should do, and then we get annoyed when they fail to live up to our expectations. \"Common standards of decency,\" we say. While expecting others to be fundamentally decent is a worthy idea, it can cause true annoyance and even unhappiness. There's another way to do it: Set low expectations. Don't lose faith in humanity, but don't expect people to wow you with their manners, their thoughtfulness, their speech. When you don't expect a lot from others to begin with, you appreciate it more when they please you. Setting reasonable expectations is a major key to being less annoyed. \"What do I get out of being annoyed?\" If you think about it, it's probably not all that much. Maybe you feel superior to the other person. But do you really want your judgment of who you are to derive from what other people do, or what you do? Your identity will be a lot stronger if you base it off of what you do, not what others do. A lot of the time, when someone annoys us, we feel such a strong emotion that it's hard not to react. That's when we say something we shouldn't, or do something regrettable. Yelling \"Stop!\" or \"Shut up!\" is an example. Most of the time, our outburst makes the situation worse instead of making it better. After breathing deeply, center yourself and take a moment to see if it's worth your time to react. It may not be. Of course, if a coworker has just finished a sexist diatribe, it's probably a good thing to say something like \"Steve, I don't think it's appropriate to compare women and cows like that.\" But if a coworker has just finished playing the same practical joke on you for the twentieth time, not giving him the satisfaction of a reaction will probably serve you best in the long run. Frowns, glaring, and other unpleasant body language convey anger and contempt. And they're contagious, too, so if they target the person who's annoying you, that person is likely to feel angry back. Before you know it, things can escalate. As much as possible, maintain a calm, collected demeanor, betraying nothing that suggests you're annoyed. Instead of assuming that the annoying person is trying to annoy you, assume that they don't know how they are coming off. Most people aren't deliberately trying to annoy you; they probably don't realize that what they are doing is annoying. In other words, they probably are in their own world and may not even be aware of you. Remember, you think about you more than anyone else does \u2014 the same fact is true for everyone. A little kid is bothering you on the airplane; a man is talking loudly into his cell phone; a lady asks you the same question twice at the DMV. These are all small fry. In the big scheme of things, they don't matter. You can greatly improve your quality of life by learning to let go, stop sweating the small stuff, and focusing your limited efforts and resources on the things that truly matter for most people: friends, family, health and safety, novelty, adventure, and lasting memories. Accept the things you cannot change. You can change yourself, the color of your walls, and the decor of your house, but cannot change someone else. Focus your energies on the things that you can change and the people around you will appreciate it. No matter who you are or what you do, there will always be someone who doesn't get you or who thinks about you in an unflattering way. Don't try to win over those apathetic or hostile to you, because it's a fool's errand. It makes you annoyed that you can't get everyone to like you as much as you feel you deserve. This desire comes from a selfish place, and it's toxic.  No matter who you are, someone dislikes you. Whether it's because of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference or social class, they find it very hard to see you as a human being in your own right. It's possible for someone to overcome that prejudice, but it rarely happens, and it never happens fast. Prove the haters wrong by doing your own thing. The best thing you can do to combat ignorance or prejudice is forget about it, continue to live your life, and prove them wrong by example. Show them what an amazing person you are. Don't shove it in their face \u2014 just live your life. The people who won't notice are probably the people who are beyond saving.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens and more than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 420, "min_cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\"); word_count_check(400, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'feel'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "feel", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 17th, and 26th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [17, 26]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.6666666666666666, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo": 0.7142857142857143, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333334, "base": 0.16666666666666666}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(16, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check(17, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check(26, \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check(17, \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check(26, \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")  # Check if the word count is less than 420", "word_count_check(400, \"more than\")  # Check if the word count is more than 400", "sentence_length_check(15, \"less than\")  # Check if each sentence's length is less than 15 tokens", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"feel\", \"remove\")  # Remove the word 'feel'", "sentence_modification_check([17, 26], \"unchange\")  # Check if the 17th and 26th sentences remain unchanged"]}}}

The birth of my own children was monumental and shaped my life for the next almost 30 years. As my life went on, so did my comfort with who I was and how things were. After so many years, I knew that there was nothing that was going to change my views on life and me as a person. I was wrong. My daughter, Sarah, recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. This is our first grandchild. Let me tell you, there is nothing in this world that can prepare you for being a grandparent. It is an experience all to itself. The day started like any other, until I got the call. Sarah called to tell me that she was in labor and heading to the local hospital, and she wanted me there. I have never gotten dressed and out the door so fast in all my life. When I arrived at the hospital I found my baby, Sarah, smiling and excited to meet her son. On the way to the hospital I had images in my head of a girl who needed her mom to help her though this painful ordeal but there she was all smiles. As the day, and her labor, progress Sarah was her usual chatty, funny self. Momentary pauses during her contractions were but a semi-colon in her stories. It was hard to believe when the doctor said she was ready to push, Sarah had barely winced from what I know to be tremeandous pain. It seemed to happen in the blink of an eye. Sarah was calm and focused as she brought her son, my grandson, into this world. In that moment of birth I was not longer Mom, I became Grandma. Never did I think I could love any child more than my own, but I was wrong. Sarah was no longer my baby, she was a battle proven mother who I admired more than anyone. Though I was always careful not to spoil my own children, I found a yearning to give this little boy everything his heart desired. I had a new mission in life, to dote over and spoil my new grandson.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "sentence_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not use the word 'baby'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "baby", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 24 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 24}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 340 tokens and more than 320 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 340, "min_cnt": 320}, "function_call": "word_count_check(340, \"less than\"); word_count_check(320, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([15], \"unchange\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.6, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.2857142857142857, "simpo": 0.7692307692307692, "simpo_iter2": 0.8333333333333334, "simpo_iter3": 0.6666666666666666, "base": 0.5714285714285715}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(300, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(320, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(340, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"baby\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(24, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"year\", 1, \"more than\")"]}}}

I was picked up by an old friend who escorted me to an island he's been living on called Chilo\u00e9. A two hour car-ride and some conversation and we'd crossed the ferry, seeing sea lions swimming alongside us as we walked off the boat. We drove to the hostel he and his girlfriend had opened, I'd be rooming there for three nights. Right away I felt the whole weight of the world taken off my shoulders. No internet, no cell phones, no hustle and bustle of city streets. Nature was everyplace and I was joined by two other travelers, my friend and his girlfriend as they cooked dinner for the group. We sat around a large table and shared a meal and some local beer and talked about our plans for the following days. On awakening at 6 AM I smelled a pot of coffee that was brewing from a kettle on the stove. We all shuffled to the kitchen still half-asleep. We had coffee and some toast and piled into a van that would take us on our very first Chilo\u00e9 adventure. We crossed the river in a boat manned by Octavio, a local craftsman and part-time tour fixer. When we arrived on the island I had no clue what to expect from our hike. The start of the path was filled with trees and I couldn't see far beyond them. We all got off the boat and began our trek together, a humble group of four. As we rounded a corner and climbed a small hill...the otherside was otherworldly. Green and lush plantlife framed the ocean with waves crashing up onto the sandy beaches, wild horses roaming around and the site of an old shipwreck washed to shore was visable. The sun was breaking through the clouds and it was perhaps the most incredible vista I've been privy to my whole life. The air was fresh and cool and we all stopped for a moment to really take it all in. The hike would continue along the beach and then into a forest preserve, mud, old outposts and finally back onto the beach as we awaited our dangerous trek through wasit-high waters that were a bit volatile to get to the portion of the island that housed a colony of penguins. I had to sign a waver and slowly traverse a half-raging sea but the end result was a dream come true. To walk among the penguins. No camera, no cell phone to capture the moment I was razor-focused on preserving it in my memory. That trip was one I will never, ever forget. The new friendships formed, the fresh seafood enjoyed from boats just back from sea, the guitar playing around the living quarters of the hostel, the local beer to be had and most importantly the nature of Chilo\u00e9 that brought me back from the insanity of city life...back to nature.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_check([20], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\"); word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(20, \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 32 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 32}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 20th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [20]}, "function_call": "sentence_check([20], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 440 tokens and more than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_range", "value": {"max_cnt": 440, "min_cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(440, \"less than\"); word_count_check(420, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"gpt4o": 0.6, "simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333334, "sft": 0.3333333333333333, "simpo": 0.7142857142857143, "simpo_iter2": 0.7692307692307692, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333334, "base": 0.3636363636363636}, "tool_list_response": {"gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check(20, \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"dream come true\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"one\", 2, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(440, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["sentence_length_check(31, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"greater than\")", "sentence_modification_check([20], \"unchange\")"]}}}

Avoid using the term '3/4 cup':\n\nEating high-quality or nutrient-dense protein will benefit you more than consuming lower quality protein. For example, eating protein that's high in saturated fats will benefit you less than eating a lean protein that also has other nutrients. While emphasizing lean meats and other protein sources, don't think that you must give up meat. For example, even though red meat contains protein, it can also increase blood pressure and cholesterol. Instead, choose lean meats like turkey or beans. Beef and pork contain high levels of protein, but they should be eaten in moderation. Instead, eat more lean meats which include skinless chicken and turkey. You can also eat fish like tuna or salmon. The egg has the highest biological value of all proteins. The biological value provides a measurement of how efficient the body utilizes protein consumed in the diet. Eggs and other animal proteins are considered \"complete\" proteins, as they contain all of the essential amino acids.  2 eggs contain 13 grams of protein. Vegetarians need at least 3.5 ounces of protein a day (for a 2,000 calorie diet). You can easily get healthy protein from eggs and dairy products. If you're vegan, you can get protein from a variety of plant-based foods like:  Soy products (Eat 75 grams of tofu to get 21 grams of protein) Meat substitutes Legumes (Try 3/4 cup cooked lentils for 13 grams of protein) Nuts (Try 1/4 cup of almonds for 8 grams of protein) Seeds Whole grains (Eat 1/2 cup whole grain pasta for 4 grams of protein) While these may not have as much protein as other foods like meat or dairy, fruits and vegetables offer some protein and other important nutrients. Fruits and vegetables with the highest amount of protein include:  Potato with the skin (5 grams of protein) 1/2 cup of broccoli (2 grams of protein) Avocado (3 grams of protein) Banana (1 gram of protein) Dairy is a great way for vegetarians and non-vegetarians to get protein. Research suggests that protein from milk may be easier to digest than meat, soy, or wheat proteins. Consider including:  1 cup of milk (8 grams of protein) 1/2 cup of cottage cheese (15 grams of protein) 1.75 ounce of cheddar cheese (12 grams of protein) 3/4 cup of yogurt (8 grams of protein) Track the amount of protein in everything you eat during the day. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service has a searchable nutrition database on its website here: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods This makes it easy to track how many grams of protein you eat. For example, protein intake from a simple breakfast like oatmeal with blueberries, milk, and yogurt would break down like this: 1 cup of oats (10.65 g of protein), 1/2 cup blueberries (0 protein), 1 cup of low-fat milk (4.26 g protein), and 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt (10.19 g protein) = 25.1 grams of protein. Once you've tracked all of your protein for the day, determine if you ate enough protein. For example, if you're a 120 pound person, you should be eating a minimum of 43.2 grams of protein a day, according to the USDA. If you find that you only ate 40 grams, try to include more protein in your diet. Remember that there are special circumstances in which you might need more protein in your diet. For example, if you're 120 pounds, but are nursing,  you should be eating a minimum of 71 grams of protein a day.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"cup\", 4, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 15th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [15]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 540 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 540}, "function_call": "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word '3/4 cup'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "3/4 cup", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333333, "gpt4o": 0.7499999999999999, "base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 1.0, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"cup\", 4, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")"], "base": ["word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "detect_keyword(\"3/4 cup\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(540, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([15], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"3/4 cup\", \"remove\")"]}}}

Avoid using the word 'that':\n\nIneffective team leaders aren\u2019t just people who boss everyone around and demand a level of respect that hasn\u2019t been earned. Ineffective team leaders are also people who don\u2019t establish a clear, transparent hierarchy within the team as a whole. If you are the leader, you are at the top. You have the final say on things and assign roles to your team.  Hold a meeting with your team, especially if you are new to leading or your team has just been established. During your meeting, discuss with your team everyone\u2019s role and be clear about who reports to who. Draw up a chart that has everyone\u2019s name and title on it. Your sheet should have a hierarchy that shows you and your role at the top, who reports directly to you, and so on. Also make it clear that you intend to respect everyone\u2019s roles and acknowledge how important and vital each one is to your successful team. This not only means keeping frequent and open communication with your team and helping to answer any questions. It also means filling in any gaps, solving any problems, and that you should be working the hardest, and often, the longest.  A bad team leader delegates projects and tasks to everyone else and goes home early. A good team leader is constantly making sure everyone is on track, organized, and picking up any slack. Make yourself available to your team when you are needed. You should also set boundaries that everyone will adhere to. Your team should be able to get your attention when needed, but not every time a question arises. Use your hierarchy to facilitate a chain of command and set your boundaries. Additionally, set boundaries on both your and your team\u2019s workload. Before accepting a leadership position, re-negotiate your own workload with your boss so you can be available to your team. Then, do the same for your team. As a team leader, you may have to stay later than your team. Come into work earlier, or even on the weekends. Your goal is to prevent your whole team from having to do this. Give your team workload boundaries that can be followed so the members of your team don\u2019t get overwhelmed or too stressed. This is similar to making the time to lead. As a team leader you may have more perks, a bigger paycheck, and an extra vacation day or two, but you also have more responsibility. Your team\u2019s mistakes are ultimately your fault and your responsibility.  Treat everyone on your team with equal respect. Keep an open and honest communication and show your team that you are here to solve any problems or make any needed adjustments that benefit the team as a whole. Be respectful of other teams and people in other departments. Never criticise other individuals or departments, especially around the team. After all, if your team sees you behaving a certain way, members may think it\u2019s ok to behave similarly. Not only is that kind of behavior disrespectful and unprofessional, but it falls on you. Although your job isn\u2019t just to hand off work to others, part of establishing yourself as a good team leader is knowing when to delegate certain tasks. Make it clear what everyone will be expected to do and accomplish. Don\u2019t hover either. Trust your team to do the job at hand.  Be decisive as well. People are more likely to follow and respect you if you can make quick, well informed decisions. When you procrastinate, your team sees that and it can be perceived as weakness. You\u2019re there to lead and make decisions, so be prepared to do so. If you are faced with a decision that impacts any part of the team, or you may not have all of the information you need to make an informed decision, go to your team. Ask for a report or status update on a part of a project that can help you with your decision. Talk with your team about your options and get input. Being a good team leader is knowing how to differentiate between managing all the projects your team is working on and leading the team that is working on those projects. While you need to oversee everyone and all of the projects, you should let your team do the work that each team member was hired to do.  Managing is more task-oriented, keeping track of meetings and events, building and maintaining everyone\u2019s schedules, and allowing the proper time and resources for tasks to be completed correctly. Leading your team requires you to provide support and motivate your team members to accomplish the assigned tasks. A good leader won\u2019t micromanage and tell team members how to do everything. Instead, inspire and motivate your team members to contribute ideas and methods that work best for each individual.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 400 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 400}, "function_call": "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 14 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 14}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 6th, and 25th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [6, 25]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word 'that'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "that", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8333333333333333, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666665, "base": 0.7142857142857143, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.33333333333333337, "simpo_iter2": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter3": 1.0}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(50, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")", "sentence_modification_check([], \"change\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"that\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([6, 25], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(400, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(14, \"less than\")"]}}}

Choose a paint color that matches the aesthetic in the rest of your room.  Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish. You can buy chalky paint from any painting supply store. Adding marks to a table surface or furniture legs can make it seem older than what it actually is. Lightly tap your furniture with the end of a chisel or hammer to make indents in the surface. Make the marks random so it doesn\u2019t look like an intentional pattern.  Wear safety glasses in case any wood accidentally breaks off your furniture. Experiment with different tools around your house to see what kind of marks they make. Use 120-grit sandpaper to roughen the surfaces on your piece of furniture. This helps the paint adhere better so it\u2019s less likely to peel off or chip. Make sure to sand any surface you plan on painting so you get a nice even coat. You do not need to sand unfinished wood furniture. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out until it\u2019s damp. Wipe all of the surfaces you plan on painting to get rid of any dust or dirt that\u2019s on them. Use another cloth to dry any areas that are wet before you start. Dip the ends of the bristles in your paint so there\u2019s only a small amount on your paintbrush. Start from the top of your piece of furniture and work toward the bottom. Apply a thin layer of paint on the surface so it can dry fast and even. When you\u2019re finished with the first coat, leave it to dry overnight. It\u2019s okay if you still see the wood or laminate underneath your first coat of paint. This can help add to the distressed look of the final piece. Once the first coat of paint has dried completely, put another coat of paint on your piece. Again, work from the top of the furniture down toward the bottom, and paint until it has a smooth matte finish. When you\u2019re done, let it dry for 3-4 days so the paint has time to adhere to the furniture. Corners and edges are usually the first parts that wear away over time, so start by distressing them. Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath. Apply light pressure so you don\u2019t accidentally remove more than you want.  Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it\u2019s been scratched up after moving around a lot. Wipe any dust away with a damp rag so you can easily see where you\u2019ve already distressed the furniture. If you accidentally rub off too much of the paint, you may paint over the area again and start over. Wax acts as a sealant to help protect your furniture from any damage. Dip the end of a cheesecloth in the wax and spread it across the surface of your furniture. Work the wax into the surface in a circular motion until it\u2019s smooth. Continue waxing the entire piece of furniture so it\u2019s sealed.  Furniture wax can be bought from your local hardware or paint supply stores. Wax may take up to 30 days to completely cure, but you can use the furniture after one week.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 1th, and 8th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [1, 8]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 9 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 9}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 460 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 460}, "function_call": "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 29 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.7499999999999999, "base": 0.16666666666666666, "sft": 0.5, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.33333333333333337, "simpo_iter3": 0.5}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(460, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"paint\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"furniture\", \"keep\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"distress\", \"keep\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"paint\", 2, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(10, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["python", "word_count_check(9, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo": ["sentence_modification_check([1, 8], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(10, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(9, \"more than\")"]}}}

Tanning is, however, associated with skin aging and skin cancer. It is also important to understand that tanning does not protect a person from sunburn.  If you are going out into the sun, wear sunscreen, especially if you are trying to avoid more getting more of a tan. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a broad spectrum sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection, and that is at least SPF 30 or higher.  The sunscreen should also be water resistant. Some exposure to the sun allows the skin to manufacture an important vitamin, vitamin D. To get the right amount, you should get moderate exposure of the face, arms, legs, or back from the summer sun for about five to 30 minutes. This can be done between the hours of 10 AM and 3 PM at least twice a week without  sunscreen if you have darker or already tanned skin. If you are lighter skinned, avoid getting into the sun during peak hours and instead allow some moderate exposure to the sun outside of the peak sun hours to supply the needed Vitamin D without significantly increasing the risk of skin damage or skin cancer.  The New Zealand dermatology association suggests that lighter skinned individuals can spend five minutes in the sun before 11AM and after 4 PM, which are the peak sun hours. Because of the light tone of their skin, lighter skinned individuals achieve healthy levels of Vitamin D during this time period. Darker skinned individuals can spend 20 minutes outside the peak hours and achieve healthy levels of Vitamin D.  The American Academy of Dermatology does not recommend any sun exposure other than the incidental exposure you might get by getting your mail,  walking your dog, going between your parked car and your office, or any other normal, everyday activity.  Sunscreen does decrease the amount of Vitamin D production, but the benefits of protecting the skin are important to understand. Since there are so many guidelines and issues surrounding sun exposure and time in the sun, you can get your Vitamin D from other sources and avoid too much sun exposure. There are also food sources of Vitamin D, including fish and fish oil, yogurt, cheese, liver, and eggs. You can also try other foods and drinks that are fortified with Vitamin D, such as breakfast cereals, milk, and juice. When dealing with your skin and the sun, it is important to understand the risks of skin cancer so you can avoid them as much as possible. If you think you have skin cancer or might be at a high risk, talk to your doctor immediately to get tested or learn the best preventative measures for your particular case. Risk factors that increase your chance of skin cancer include:  Fair skin A history of sunburns. Excessive sun exposure Sunny or high-altitude climates Pre-existing moles The presence of precancerous skin lesions A personal or family history of skin cancer A weakened or suppressed immune system Exposure to medical radiation Exposure to certain cancer-causing substances\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 37 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 37}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not use the word '20 minutes'.", "constrain_type": "remove_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "20 minutes", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 17th, and 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [17, 19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 17 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 17}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(17, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.6, "sft": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo": 0.6, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.7499999999999999}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_detection(\"20 minutes\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["python", "sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"20 minutes\", \"remove\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_length_check(37, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([17, 19], \"unchange\")"]}}}

The past few weeks had been nothing but a blur; we'd had reading period and exams, and then I went home for two weeks to do basically nothing but visit family. Once I flew back to Boston, it was a few more days of hanging out with friends, making some final memories, and finally beginning that last day. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea). We didn't really talk much; I think we were just tired and overwhelmed. Eventually, we were all called to head outside and get ready to parade from the House to Harvard Yard. We were led by a small brass band that was only slightly better than the Harvard University Band, which isn't exactly a compliment. They directed us to Memorial Chapel, which they somehow packed in the entire class of 2019 into. Fire codes were definitely violated. At Memorial Chapel, the minister gave a short sermon and led the class in a few hymns. I'm not religious at all, but being in that church with that group of incredible people that were going to go on to do amazing things was a really powerful experience. I felt very connected to everyone. I also had to pee, but it was absolutely impossible to get out, haha. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession into Tercentenary Theater, where the commencement exercises are held. My roommates and I were near the front and got to wave and cheer the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel!!!) as they entered. The actual exercises proceeded as they always have. After the sheriff of Middlesex county formally calls the meeting to order and the standard pleasantries are observed, the dean of each school presents his/her class to President Bacow, who would then essentially say \"Poof! You've graduated!\". Afterwards, I and the other Band seniors ran up to the Band as they played the recessional music and we each conducted our favorite fight song. As big and grand as the actual exercises were, they paled in comparison to the feeling of being with the Band, which was the one place at Harvard where I always felt absolutely welcome and included. Band absolutely defined the past four years of my life, and standing in front of them as I conducted Ten Thousand Men of Harvard -- I felt on top of the world. Afterwards, we had the actual degree ceremony back at our House, which my roommate and I were nearly late to. It was a really noticeable contrast from Band as I noticed that of the hundred or so other graduates in my House, I only knew my roommates and perhaps ten others. That night, the Band party provided both closure and countless tears. The next day, I was off to Greece with some friends for a vacation.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([4], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 4th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [4]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([4], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'Theater'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "Theater", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 21 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 21}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 1.0, "simpo_iter3": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([3], \"unchange\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([4], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(20, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([4], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([4], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"Theater\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"Theater\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(21, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"]}}}

A bathroom is a good place. You'll also want an area that is easy to sterilize and clean up all the blood when you're done. First of all, make a solution of 1 part bleach and four parts water. Clean the bathroom thoroughly. Scrub any area that you think you might touch during the procedure. Clean every inch of the counter. The cleaner this place is, the safer you are. If you bought sterile clamps and jewelry, then great, but if not, it might be a good idea to boil these in a pot of water, then wipe them down with some of your bleach and water solutions. It's probably a good idea to sterilize these regardless since you don't know what they may have come into contact with since you got them. Once everything is clean, put on a pair of gloves and lay out all your supplies. Extra gloves, sterile needle, sterile clamps, sterile jewelry, alcohol wipes, a marker, and a small blob of A&D ointment. Remove your gloves and throw them away. Now, put on a pair of fresh, clean rubber gloves. Use an alcohol wipe to clean off the area where you want to pierce yourself. Use a marker to make two dots, one where you want the needle to go in, and one where you want the needle to come out. Make sure that these dots are a suitable distance apart for your jewelry. Take a step back and imagine it with jewelry in it. Make very sure that it is straight and just how you want it because it is a pain to have to take it out and redo it all over again. Realize that marking these dots does not guarantee that this is where the jewelry will go. If you move (due to, for example, serious pain), you might shift the needle and end up with a crooked piercing. A good reason to have someone else do this for you. Put on a fresh pair. Now take your clamps (if you have them) and stretch out the skin in the place you have marked. Line up the two dots on either side of the skin and gently let the clamps close on the skin. You should be able to see one dot on each side of the clamp, and each dot should be centered so that a straight line(a needle) could pass through both of them correctly. This method is better suited to only certain types of penis piercings. For PA's, you'll need to use a different method. They are harder to do and really should be done by a professional. If you didn't buy a clamp, this would be a little trickier. You must use one hand to stretch the skin and line it up like above so that a straight line could pass through both. It can be tough to hold the skin like this when you are coming at it with a needle in the other hand (another reason to have it professionally done).\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 22 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 22}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the 12th, and 22th sentence.", "constrain_type": "unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [12, 22]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain less than 29 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 29}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 420 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 420}, "function_call": "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.33333333333333337, "sft": 0.888888888888889, "simpo": 0.7272727272727272, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.8333333333333333}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(28, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"sterile\", 2, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword()", "word_count_check(420, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"few years.\", \"remove\")", "sentence_count_check(22, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(29, \"less than\")", "sentence_modification_check([12, 22], \"unchange\")"]}}}

I have been in the classroom for the past few weeks and was enjoying it so much.   My son was starting to have issues at school, so the school recommended that he be put on half a day.   With him on half a day, I was only able to student teach for half a day.  My college was okay with this, but I realized that I wasn't.  I was only going to be there until 10:40 and that wasn't long enough for me to learn what I wanted to learn.  It was such a hard decision.  Not only did I have to give up the student teaching, but I also had to drop out of my college. I never imagined that I would be a college drop out. Even for a semester. I was so excited to get into graduate school!  To top it all off - since I had to drop out of college they are making me pay 10% of my bill.   This is a couple of hundred dollars, which I don't have!  I will have to pay this back before I am able to apply to go back in January.  This is also still up in the air because we aren't even sure if my son will be able to go back to full time in January.   This whole situation has really been weighing heavy on my heart.  I have stayed home for so long with my children, and I was so excited to finally get out there and find myself.  I wanted to find my future career and finally start it.   The only thing that makes this easier is that my son is doing so much better in school.  It is hard to give up something you were excited about.  Seeing the reason why you gave something up flourishing does make it much easier.  I am planning on doing other things while I wait to get back to school. I am applying to teach online to kids in China.  I am hoping this will keep me prepared for my student teaching.  To me, something is better than nothing.

Eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat meat and dairy. There are government programs such as the WIC (Women, Infant, and Children) that can help you afford good food. Avoid soda and junk food, and eat healthy snacks like fruits and nuts in between classes to keep your energy up.  An empty stomach can lead to morning sickness and nausea. Carry a mild snack like wholegrain crackers to eat throughout the day. Try to drink fluids throughout the day, cutting back during mealtimes.  Seek treatment if you have an eating disorder. You can seriously harm your child and yourself if you give birth without adequate nutrition.  If you eat at home, teach your family about good nutrition. You and whoever cooks in your house should come up with meals together that will support your health. Drugs, alcohol, caffeine, junk food, and cigarettes are all harmful for your child and yourself. Drugs and alcohol are also bad for your schoolwork. The sooner you are able to quit, the better. Talk to your school nurse, your counselor, or a doctor to get help with addiction. Ask your friends and family for their support while you give up smoking, drinking, and eating unhealthy food. You may find you need to sleep longer hours, or take naps after school or in between classes. Ask your school if there is a place you can lie down if you find you need a nap during the day. Exercise will help you sleep better, reduce health risks for you and your baby, and ease your back pain. If you always exercise, you can probably continue a similar exercise regimen during your pregnancy.  If you do not normally exercise, start by going on walks or exercising for 10 or 15 minutes at a time until you build up more stamina. Avoid any exercise that has you lying on your back after your first trimester. Avoid exercise that puts you at risk of falling. Drink plenty of fluids while you exercise. Check your local hospital, fitness center or gym for exercise classes for pregnant people, such as prenatal yoga. For a pregnant student, school becomes less of a social space and more of a job. You're taking care of your body full time, so taking care of schoolwork will need a special focus. You also might experience what is sometimes called \"baby brain,\" or a lack of focus and memory associated with pregnancy. Keep a calendar with all your assignments as well as your doctors appointments and other dates. Get a tutor or talk to your teachers if you are struggling with understanding the material. Talk to your doctor about sex during pregnancy. If your doctor says you it is safe for you to have sex while you are pregnant, use a condom when you do. Sexually transmitted infections can be extremely harmful to newborn babies. Use a condom to avoid contracting an illness that could hurt you and could cause cause blindness, pneumonia, or meningitis in the baby. If you are in college, you have the option of taking a semester or a year off. Talk to your guidance counselor about the possibility of leaving and picking up where you were. You might want to stay in school while pregnant and then take a year off if you are keeping the child, or you might need to stay in school in order to collect your financial aid. If you do take time off, make sure you apply for extra scholarships for students who are parents when you are ready to return. If you are in high school and you are struggling to take care of your pregnancy and your schoolwork, consider taking classes for your GED. Talk to your school counselor about this decision.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_detection_tool(\"first\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 33 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 33}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'first'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "first", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 6 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 6}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 560 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 560}, "function_call": "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.8000000000000002, "base": 0.7272727272727272, "sft": 0.4000000000000001, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter3": 0.6}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_detection_tool(\"first\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")"], "base": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"first\")", "word_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"first\")", "word_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(32, \"less than\")", "word_count_check(560, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(33, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"first\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(6, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(560, \"less than\")"]}}}

Before reaching out to another person, it may be helpful to think about why you need and want to change your behavior.  People have different motivations for quitting. You may be motivated by a desire to manage your pain better. You may be fearful of the behavior getting worse, or getting sent to the hospital. You may also worry about how your cutting affects friends and loved ones. Whatever your reasons, identify why you want to quit. Starting a journal to write down how you are feeling when you want to cut can help understand how to stop or find other coping methods. It can even help to write down a list of reasons that you do not want to cut anymore. You can refer back to this list in moments when you feel tempted. It is very hard to stop cutting on your own. It can be helpful to open up to someone when you begin the quitting process. This person can provide you with support along the way.  Choose someone you know you can trust. You do not want to pick a friend who's notorious for gossip or someone who is judgmental. It may be a good idea to tell a parent, as your mom or dad can help you find professional help. It can be scary to admit to someone you have been cutting. You may be afraid of an adverse reaction. Keep in mind, however, you will probably feel relieved once you tell someone. It's very hard to keep things bottled up, and you will feel better once you've reached out and asked for support. Consider speaking with your pediatrician or family doctor as a first step. They can be a very helpful resource. It may be easier to tell your parents, too, if you have already talked about it with your doctor and you, your parents, and your doctor can discuss it together. Your comfort is very important. Telling someone you have been cutting is not easy, and it's important you open up in a way that makes you feel safe.  You do not have to have a face-to-face conversation right away. If the idea of telling someone directly is scary, try writing a letter or email. Allow the person to process, and then talk face-to-face later on. You don't have to share everything. If you're not ready to open up about some information, give yourself time. Make it clear to the person you may not answer all the questions they have. You do not have to show your injuries or explain any details you're not ready to share. Focus on your feelings when you talk to the other person. Do not talk primarily about the self-harm behavior. Talk about the feelings, situations, or emotions that led to the behavior. For example, \"I've been so stressed about school. I think I'm having trouble managing my emotions about my senior year.\" It can be shocking to hear a loved one is cutting. The person you open up to may need time to process the information. Have some patience.  You may dislike someone's initial reaction. Remember, reactions are usually temporary. Just because someone responds with shock, fear, or anger does not mean they will feel this way forever. These reactions usually come out of concern for you. It can help to print out some pamphlets about cutting that you find online. Many people do not understand self-harm. Having some reading material can help them process. If you have already reached out for help from a health professional, such as your family doctor or a counselor at school, it may be helpful for you and your parents to meet with them so they can support you as you tell your parents. It's great to have someone to support you as you quit. However, a friend, family member, or loved one may not be able to help you during a crisis. In some situations, psychiatric or medical help is necessary.  If you ever feel suicidal, call 9-1-1. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at (800) 273-8255. If you find yourself in crisis without anyone to talk to, call (800) 366-8288.

A large body of research has shown that timely feedback is crucial to student learning [5, 6]. However, students are largely unable to receive timely feedback on written proofs due to the need to have proofs collected and hand-graded by instructors or teaching assistants. The ability to grade student proofs fully automatically with natural language processing (NLP) alleviates this need by allowing us to give students instant feedback on their proofs to let students iteratively enhance the quality of their proofs. In this paper, we propose a novel set of training methods and models capable of autograding freeform mathematical proofs, a problem at the intersection of mathematical proof education and Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG), by using existing NLP models and other machine learning techniques. Our proof autograder enables the development of grading systems that provide instant feedback to students without needing attention from instructors. It can also be deployed in large-scale educational platforms, allowing for more access for students. The main contributions of this paper are: \u2022 Introducing the first pipeline of machine learning models capable of autograding mathematical proofs with similar accuracy to human graders \u2022 Quantifying the amount of training data needed to achieve a satisfactory performance from the grading models \u2022 Publishing an anonymized and labeled mathematical proof dataset that can be used in future model developments [7] \u2022 Creating a set of autograded problems using the grading pipeline, and performing a user study that answers the following research questions: \u2013 Are students able to write better proofs by interacting with the autograder and the feedback it generates? \u2013 Are students satisfied with the autograder and the feedback it provides? \u2013 Does using the autograder make students more willing to use similar AI autograders in the future? The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first introduce the related work in Section 2, and then present the source and preprocessing of the training data for our model in 3.1. We then introduce the large language models used in the grading process and our own model for grade calculation in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.4 gives the methods for the comparison to human graders. In Section 4, we show the performances from each large language model on the data, and compare the model grading against human grader performances.

The definitive Version of Record was published in Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023 (WWW \u201923), May 1\u20135, 2023, Austin, TX, USA,  //doi.org/10.1145/3543507.3583348. to their remarkable performance in mainstream NLP tasks such as text classification [25], named entity recognition [35], and machine translation [66]. As training a large-scale language model requires a massive amount of data and tremendous computational resources, individuals and small companies are normally unable to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch for their applications [59, 72]. Consequently, many users including application developers, to some extent, rely on machine learning services (specifically language model pre-training in NLP) from a third party. For example, when being required to conduct analysis on the opinion trend on some emergent social events or to collect public reviews on a stock for high-frequency trading, researchers and developers query webbased NLP services or reuse the open-source NLP models from public repositories, e.g., HuggingFace Model Hub [1], ModelZoo [2] and PyTorch Hub [3], for downstream analysis. Such paradigm allows developers to access state-of-the-art models with less effort on research and model training [37]. Despite the convenience provided by third parties, the opacity of their identities provides attackers with ample opportunities to pose threats to users\u2019 applications. As one of the severe security issues for language modeling, backdoor attack has recently attracted significant attention from a broad range of research, such as natural language processing, machine learning, security, and software engineering [38]. Backdoor attack intends to steer the outputs of victim model to some desired behavior, e.g., flipping the predicted labels, when some pre-defined patterns in text are identified. For example, the predicted sentiment of a text is always negative if a trigger phrase \u201cJoe Biden\u201d is involved [15]. Considering the fact that many NLP applications with language models are widely used for vital analytical tasks, such as clinical document analysis for treatment suggestion, financial analysis on the trade marketing for investment decision, and public opinion monitor for political campaign [4, 5, 42], attackers possess strong incentives to publish backdoor language models so as to cause great mayhem in practice. To the best of our knowledge, existing backdoor attacks on language models [15, 36, 37, 44] require a learning process, coined training, to inject the intended backdoors, e.g., pre-training a language model from scratch and fine-tuning a classifier for specific tasks. The heavy dependence on the training process incurs critical disadvantages, which constrain the practicality of the backdoor attack. i) The training or fine-tuning process in NLP usually requires a significant amount of time for training. Namely, the attack efforts could be huge. ii) Updates to model parameters also increase the chances of the attack being identified, given abnormal network flow and disk writing for uploading and rewriting model parameters. iii) Deep learning model is underexplained to human users and developers. Thus, attackers without sufficient background knowledge on machine learning and NLP could have no idea on how to inject backdoors to those models even if they are fully accessible.             \fWWW \u201923, May 1\u20135, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Yujin Huang 1\u2217, Terry Yue Zhuo 1,2\u2217, Qiongkai Xu 3\u2020, Han Hu , Xingliang Yuan 1\u2020, Chunyang Chen In this work, we propose a more stealthy and practical trainingfree backdoor attack using lexical modification to the model, coined TFLexAttack. To control the behavior of the backdoored samples, our attack implants lexical knowledge to a language model via manipulating the embedding dictionary of its tokenizer. Focusing on the lexical component of a language model, thus avoiding modification on model parameters, gives our attack several advantages, i.e., i) almost on-the-fly modification on the model without timeconsuming training, ii) little modification to the model dictionary, iii) theoretically consistent performance on the text without backdoor triggers, and iv) explainable to attackers. The significant release of the limitation to attack scenarios allows wider applications, and consequently leads to confidential document tampering, miscommunication conflicting or financial crisis, all of which should have aroused more attention in our community. We summarise our contributions as follows: \u2022 We are the first to study the risk of open-source language models through the lens of the tokenizer, and propose a Training-Free Lexical Backdoor Attack (TFLexAttack) that covertly implants triggers into language models without model (re)training. \u2022 We realize our attack via two strategies TFLexAttack-substitution and TFLexAttack-insertion. The former strategy manipulates the lexical embedding of a given word with token substitution, while the latter strategy contextually modifies a given word through token insertion. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on three dominant NLP tasks including Sentiment Classification, Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation over nine language models. Our results show that TFLexAttack-substitution and TFLexAttack-insertion, are attacker-friendly, with regard to both attaining the expected malicious behavior and stealthy to normal users.", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Output contain less than 500 tokens.", "constrain_type": "tot_len_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 500}, "function_call": "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain less than 18 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_less_than", "value": {"cnt": 18}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(18, \"less than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'ModelZoo'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "ModelZoo", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 15 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 15}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002, "gpt4o": 0.6666666666666665, "base": 0.5454545454545454, "sft": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.6666666666666665, "simpo_iter3": 0.6}, "tool_list_response": {"simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"], "base": ["python", "text_eval()", "keyword_detection()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "keyword_frequency_check(\"ModelZoo\", 2, \"less than\")"], "sft": ["text_eval()", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"equal\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")"], "simpo": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"ModelZoo\", \"keep\")"], "simpo_iter2": ["text_eval()", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter3": ["python", "text_eval()", "detect_keyword(\"ModelZoo\")", "word_count_check(500, \"less than\")", "sentence_count_check(18, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(15, \"more than\")"]}}}

I was particularly excited since most of the people at this house I had no idea who they were since it was for a friend who i am close with, but not his group of friends. So we all got to the house and of course, nobody was there since I had gotten off of work late. I find out that we are all over on at a bar down the street so I head out over that way. I meet everyone and the beers start flowing pretty generously. That evening we all took a turn for the worst as we all struggled to make it to bar close and then back to the air bnb where we were all staying. That night I ended up going home since the Air BNB didnt have any AC in it. I mean, who gets an Air BNB with no AC?! It was super humid, so it was tough to stay there. That morning, some of the bros came over to my house and we had a few beers. We headed back over the Air bib since that day we were all going to go to a brewers game by way of the party bus. Well the party bus was of course an hour late to pick us up and actually had no AC just like the air bnb which we thought was all really funny. So we partied all day at a tailgate and met lots of new people. Since none of the people who were at this bachelor party really knew eachother, it was fun to see everyone's differnet traditions and norms for getting turned up in a parking lot. We learned tons of new games and pretty much drank a truck load of white claws during teh course of the day. You know as they say, Aint no laws when youre drinking claws.

Start by removing all of the items from your tables and storage spaces. Then, clean out the drawers of your dresser and your closet, and decide which items you'd like to keep. Remove all of the decorations from the walls, and place everything that you're keeping in a different room.  Remember to take everything out of your closet and remove any storage from under your bed. For items that you aren't going to use, consider donating anything that is in good condition. As you clean out your room, look for items you can upcycle to fit your new decor. A new coat of paint, a stain, new knobs, or new upholstery can breathe new life into an old or outdated item. It's possible to decorate your bedroom on a very small budget, but having around $200-$300 to spend is a reasonable budget for a small redecorating project, like adding accents. For larger projects, like repainting, buying new furniture, or replacing flooring, try to have around $1,000 saved.  The important part of making a budget is sticking to it. Before you purchase anything, make sure the items fit in your budget and that you won't go over. It might be helpful to get an average price for the items that you want to buy before you start your project. Then, try to save around that amount of money. Don't let a small budget discourage you. You can make the most of your money by shopping sales, the clearance section, or a thrift store. Once everything is cleared out of your room, you can select which pieces of furniture you want to keep. For most bedrooms, you should plan to have a bed, a dresser, at least one nightstand, and a space to hang clothes, like an armoire if you don't have a closet.  For pieces that are in good shape but you don't want to keep them, try repurposing them for another room, or sell them in a yard sale or on an online marketplace, like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You might reuse some of your furniture for a different purpose. For example, using an armoire as a TV stand or an old trunk as a night stand can give your room a collected or eclectic feel. Make sure your bedroom is a reflection of your interests, styles, and taste. Pick a general theme, like rustic, farmhouse, vintage, or modern, and choose a color scheme that complements your style. When choosing a color scheme, stick to 2-4 colors that you like.  For instance, in a modern theme, you might choose gray, white, and a bright green for your color scheme. Then, you can pick modern-style furniture, and add pops of green throughout the room, using gray and white as your main colors. In a vintage-themed room, you can choose a gold, cream, teal, and pale pink color scheme, with bright walls, gold accents, and pops of teal and pink throughout. You can incorporate antique furniture with gold finishes, and use pillows with bold floral prints. You don't need to create a theme in your room if you don't want one. Instead, choose neutral colors for your walls and furniture. Then, you can play around with color and design elements in your art, furniture, and decorative items.\n", "tool_test_result": {"constraint_info": ["sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"], "tool_list_response": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")"]}, "other_info": {"constraint_info": [{"prompt": "Do not change the 19th sentence.", "constrain_type": "sent_unchange_constraint", "value": {"cnt": [19]}, "function_call": "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")"}, {"prompt": "Each sentence contain more than 8 tokens.", "constrain_type": "per_len_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 8}, "function_call": "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")"}, {"prompt": "Do not change the word 'budget'.", "constrain_type": "keep_keyword", "value": {"keyword": "budget", "cnt": 0}, "function_call": "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")"}, {"prompt": "Output contain more than 20 sentences.", "constrain_type": "sent_cnt_more_than", "value": {"cnt": 20}, "function_call": "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"}], "tool_scores": {"base": 0.8000000000000002, "sft": 0.22222222222222224, "simpo": 1.0, "simpo_full_length": 0.8000000000000002, "simpo_iter2": 0.888888888888889, "simpo_iter3": 0.888888888888889, "gpt4o": 0.5714285714285715, "simpo_iter4": 0.8000000000000002}, "tool_list_response": {"base": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(19, \"equal\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")"], "sft": ["python", "text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(count=19, relation=\"equal\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(keyword=\"budget\", relation=\"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(length=8, relation=\"more than\")"], "simpo": ["sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_full_length": ["word_count_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter2": ["sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "text_eval()"], "simpo_iter3": ["sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_length_check(8, \"more than\")", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "text_eval()"], "gpt4o": ["text_eval()", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")"], "simpo_iter4": ["text_eval()", "keyword_keep_removal_check(\"budget\", \"keep\")", "sentence_count_check(20, \"more than\")", "sentence_modification_check([19], \"unchange\")", "word_count_check(8, \"more than\")"]}}}

However, pings, clicks and swipes do get irksome after a while and can intrude on the people around you. Everyone has their own music tastes as well, so even though blaring Michael Jackson is your norm at home, in an airport people want to stop-over or wait, in peace. One of the hardest thing's for a parent is to teach a child to behave in public spaces. However, it isn't an impossible task, and it's important to do so prior to visiting an airport, let alone a plane! Children are usually the main fault when it comes to proper composure and etiquette in an airport.  Strange environments may be stressful or exciting for children however as a parent it is vastly important to insure that your child is where you can see them at all times. Inform your child if they are old enough about everything you are doing to keep them up to date with the trip. It saves the constant questioning and interrupting as to where and what they are doing next. Remember to reward the child for well-esteemed behavior and discipline them for noncooperation. You should never discipline your child in public places, let alone an airport. It does put others around you on edge and humiliates the child and can result in them having adverse social ramifications later in life. For example you can promise your child that when you get to the hotel or accommodation, they will be rewarded a treat if their behavior is constantly compliant throughout the ordeal. If they were not, let them know they won't be getting a treat and instead losing a privilege (No iPad or iPod for one day of the vacation). If you have an infant, insure you escape to quiet areas of an airport to settle the child down. There are usually family rooms that you can resort to rather than interrupting people around you with screaming and crying. Rather than dumping all your belongings down and taking up an entire seating arrangement, try to keep your belongings by your side and allow for people to sit. As the boarding time draws imminent, more people will arrive and the terminal will fill up rapidly. If at any point in your visit you get lost, you lose something or you're just totally bewildered; you can find a help desk to get some clarity. Remember to also notify an airport officer if you break something and there is dangerous glass or chemicals. If you or a child (if you have one) vomits or misses the bathroom, it's common decorum to tell someone so that they can clean up the mess.  Don't think that you're judged or dwell on the humiliation, airport officials deal with this every-day. If you do miss your flight, it gets canceled or you can't find your gate and they are boarding, you need to be able to familiarize yourself with the airports uniform or the closest help desk to get the latest information so that you can dodge stress attacks. If you do see an individual participating in reckless behavior, causing a hazard to you or someones else, you need to be able to contact airport security. Security in an airport is one of the highest trained in the world. Note down the particular event and key thing's or clothing the person or group was wearing. It's important to describe people in a frank and honest way. Describing people in situations like criminal activity is understandably not a time for perfect political correctness; \" They were of a Caucasian decent with long scraggly hair\" is plausible. Sometimes in international airports you may get the occasional superstar that steals the attention of almost everyone. It's important to be calm and not act ridiculously by chasing, screaming or carrying on. If you do have the opportunity to see a personage in the flesh at the airport, it's important to treat them with respect. If they are someone you admire, it's fine to ask for a quick signature; but comprehend that their schedule is far more rigid than yours, and in most cases you may be on holidays but they are actually at work. They may have flown for many hours, they are probably tired and maybe a little not in the mood for their number one fan.  Keep your distance when getting close to the entourage. It's more than likely that the paparazzi will be more focused on getting their million dollar snap than avoiding a collision with you.
