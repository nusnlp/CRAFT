This concept has been successfully applied across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including practical applications such as automated driving and medical imaging, as demonstrated in various studies (Hendricks et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2017; Kotonya and Toni, 2020; Aggarwal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2015), and has also been employed in cutting-edge research such as automated driving (Kim et al., 2018) and medical imaging (Kayser et al., 2022). The work was conducted outside Capital One, highlighting the independence and impartiality of the research team. Figure 2: Generated VQA data along with NLE of the predicted answers, providing improved explainability over traditional VQA data by offering a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process and its underlying reasoning. These samples are three key instances from our comprehensive synthetic VQA-NLE dataset, which has been carefully designed to provide a robust and diverse set of examples for training and testing NLE-based models. A total of 66,682 unique instances of these triplets were created, making our dataset an invaluable resource for researchers and developers working on NLE-based vision-language tasks. In the realm of vision-language tasks, explanation-rich datasets like VQA-X (Park et al., 2018), VQA-E (Li et al., 2018), VCR (Zellers et al., 2019a), e-SNLI-VE (Kayser et al., 2021), and GQA-REX (Chen and Zhao, 2022) have been instrumental in advancing vision-language NLE research, and have significantly contributed to our understanding of the complex interactions within the vision-language modality. These datasets have enabled a deeper understanding and improved explainability of interactions within the vision-language modality, thereby substantially enhancing the overall effectiveness of NLE in vision-language tasks, particularly in Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite significant advancements on the topic, the scarcity of VQA-NLE data still prevails, which is a major obstacle hindering further progress in the field and underscores the need for more comprehensive and efficient data creation methods. Existing VQA-NLE datasets (Do et al., 2021; Park et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019b) heavily rely on manual human annotations, which is a time-consuming and costly process, and has resulted in significant inefficiencies in the data creation process. This has caused the data creation process to be inefficient and difficult to scale, underscoring the need for a more efficient method for generating VQA-NLE data (Lu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2018; Chen and Zhao, 2022). In this work, we propose innovative and efficient methods for generating synthetic VQA-NLE data that eliminates the need for additional resource curation while maintaining quality comparable to human-generated data. We introduce both single-step and multi-step approaches to produce high-quality data, utilizing visual prompts with bounding boxes to enhance focus and improve generation accuracy, thereby significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the data generation process. With the advent of large vision language models (LVLMs) (Liu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023), we leverage the generative capabilities of LVLMs to address current limitations for generating synthetic VQA-NLE data, and have made significant breakthroughs in this area. Figure 3: This figure showcases the samples of our generated VQA-NLE data, highlighting the diversity and complexity of the data, and providing a visual representation of the quality and comprehensiveness of our dataset. To quantitatively evaluate our method, we created an evaluation dataset and conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of various settings, providing a thorough assessment of the performance and efficiency of our proposed methods. Furthermore, we performed an efficiency analysis against crowdsourced data creation methods to reinforce our primary objective of presenting a more efficient method for generating synthetic VQA-NLE datasets. Our contributions are three-fold: We propose methods to synthetically generate high-quality VQA-NLE data using LVLMs, which show a high correlation with human annotations and have the potential to revolutionize the field of vision-language NLE research. We demonstrate the impact of various synthetic VQA-NLE generation methods to identify best practices for constructing effective and efficient synthetic VQA-NLE data, and provide valuable insights into the design and development of NLE-based vision-language models. We compare the effectiveness and efficiency of our data generation methods against human annotations for the same task, and have made significant progress in this area. Our findings highlight the strong potential of LVLM-based synthetic VQA-NLE data generation as a viable alternative, producing high-quality data with up to 20\u00d7 greater efficiency, and have the potential to transform the field of vision-language NLE research.", "scores": {"ppl": 33.484619140625, "some": 0.8858255545298258, "bart": -1.1856379508972168, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Natural Language Explanation (NLE) serves as a valuable tool for elucidating a model's decision-making process, thereby enhancing transparency and fostering trust and accountability within the domain of machine learning.

This phenomenon can lead to devastating consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among victims, as well as a breakdown in social cohesion and economic instability, ultimately hindering the development of communities, and in extreme cases, even leading to societal collapse and long-term damage to cultural heritage, including the erosion of trust, the destruction of social networks, and the loss of cultural identity. This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \"dogs\" or \"monkeys\" (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals, downplaying their suffering, or stripping them of their humanity, as exemplified in the study of Deska et al. (2020), which can be further exacerbated by the pernicious spread of hate speech on social media platforms, where online trolls and hate groups can amplify and normalize dehumanizing language, spreading it to a wider audience and creating a toxic online environment that perpetuates further violence and marginalization, including the amplification of hate speech through hashtags, the creation of online echo chambers, and the normalization of dehumanizing language through social media influencers. The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts, as it enables us to recognize the early warning signs of dehumanization and prevent its escalation, which can shape public opinion and influence policy decisions, ultimately contributing to the escalation or resolution of conflicts, as highlighted by Oberschall (1997), who emphasizes the importance of language in shaping our understanding of identity, culture, and community, and how this understanding can be used to justify or challenge existing power structures, including the role of language in perpetuating stereotypes, the manipulation of public opinion through propaganda, and the use of language to shape policy decisions. Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the challenges associated with annotating dehumanizing language, such as accurately identifying and categorizing its various forms, the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets, and the need for human annotators to provide nuanced and context-specific annotations, which can be further complicated by the use of advanced language models and deep learning techniques, highlighting the need for more publicly available datasets, more advanced annotation tools, and the involvement of human annotators in the development of more accurate and nuanced models. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees, which has significant implications for model development and social justice, including the need for more targeted and nuanced models, the development of more accurate and sensitive annotation tools, and the involvement of marginalized communities in the development and testing of models.", "scores": {"ppl": 18.245975494384766, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -2.2363100051879883, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "In the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across various tasks. Despite their effectiveness, LLMs present a substantial challenge in terms of explainability and transparency. This opacity can lead to unintended consequences, such as the generation of harmful or misleading content (Gehman et al., 2020), and the occurrence of model hallucinations (Weidinger et al., 2021). These issues underscore the urgency for improved explainability, not just for understanding, but for responsible and ethical application. Explainability in LLMs serves two critical functions. For end users, it fosters trust by clarifying the model's reasoning in a nontechnical manner (Zhao et al., 2023). For developers and researchers, it offers insights into unintended biases and areas of improvement (Bastings et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b). However, the scale of LLMs poses unique challenges to explainability. Larger models with more parameters and extensive training data are harder to interpret. Traditional explanation methods become less practical for these large-scale models (Zhao et al., 2023). Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of LLM-specific phenomena is vital, including in-context learning (Halawi et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), addressing issues such as model hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023) and inherent biases (dev, 2023; An and Rudinger, 2023; Schick et al., 2021). In this survey, we focus on explainability methods for pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs, often termed as base models. These models have billions of parameters and scale up in training data; examples include GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-J (Chen et al., 2021), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), OPT (Yordanov et al., 2022), and LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). The evaluation of these models is crucial in understanding their capabilities and limitations.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of explainability methods for pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs. In Section 2, we categorize and pose research questions based on our survey. The categorization is used to review explainability methods in Section 3, followed by a discussion in Section 4 on how these insights are leveraged. We further discuss the evaluation methods and metrics in Section 5. Our goal is to synthesize and critically assess contemporary research, aiming to bridge the gap between understanding and practical application of insights derived from complex language models.\n\n7.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "The shocks and springs in the suspension of your car were designed and built with your comfort in mind. In order to maximize comfort, the suspension allows the wheels to move up and down to limit the impact of bumps on the car's body by providing a smoother ride. Replacing these components with stiffer shocks and springs will compromise some of your ride comfort, but the added stiffness will improve traction when accelerating, braking, or turning by keeping the tires in better contact with the road. Coil-Overs are adjustable shocks and springs that allow you to lower the vehicle and stiffen the ride based on your preference and driving style. Many stiffer suspensions also lower the vehicle, which improves handling by lowering the center of gravity and reducing body roll. Anti-roll bars cross the undercarriage of your car at the front and rear to connect the sides of the body and increase the structural rigidity of your car. Swapping out the stock anti-roll bars with larger diameter replacements will further increase the rigidity of your car's body. This increased stiffness helps to ensure the tires remain flat on the ground and maintain good traction. When buying anti-roll bars, it's best to purchase them in pairs to ensure the front and rear offer the same level of torsional strength and don't permit your car to twist under hard launches or sharp turns. Anti-roll bars are also referred to as sway bars, anti-sway bars, stabilizer bars, or roll bars. High-strength tubular steel often makes a better alternative to solid bars, which can be extremely heavy and prone to failure. Your suspension has a number of bushings that separate moving metal parts, reducing vibrations and helping to maintain your car's weight distribution by providing a stable platform. Unfortunately, the rubber in these bushings deteriorates over time, causing them to lose their effectiveness and compromise the suspension's performance. Polyurethane replacement bushings are much stiffer than their rubber counterparts and won't wear down like the stock ones do, but they may require lubrication to avoid squeaking and maintain smooth operation. Bushings can be replaced one by one, or kits can be purchased to replace all of your bushings at once, depending on your car's specific needs and requirements. Some bushings may require a press to remove from their housings, a challenge that can be difficult for novice mechanics when working on the suspension. Strut tower bars connect the right and left sides of your car, similar to anti-roll bars, but are installed on the top of the car, under the hood and trunk lid, directly connecting the driver's and passenger's side struts to increase structural rigidity and keep the tires flat on the pavement during aggressive driving. These bars make an excellent addition to aftermarket anti-roll bars, reducing the amount your car leans and twists while turning, making them a great upgrade for performance enthusiasts who value handling and stability. You may not be able to access the rear strut towers to install a bar in the back of certain cars, which can limit your upgrade options and require careful planning. Strut tower bars may need to be removed when working on the engine of your car in the future, so be sure to factor this into your plans and budget accordingly. One of the most critical aspects of a car's performance is its ability to stop safely and efficiently, giving you an edge over your competitors on the road by providing confident braking and enabling you to maintain a higher rate of speed for longer. The quality of your brakes directly impacts how long you can wait to engage them before a turn, enabling you to maintain a higher rate of speed for longer than your competitors and gain a competitive advantage. Aftermarket brake pads are designed to improve your car's stopping ability by enhancing its friction, making them a popular choice among car enthusiasts who value performance and safety. They use the stock brake components and are suitable for most street applications, but may not be ideal for high-performance driving that requires more aggressive and precise braking. Ensure that your wheels are large enough to clear big brake upgrades, avoiding clearance and stability issues that can compromise your car's overall performance.", "scores": {"ppl": 25.046649932861328, "some": 0.8794473012288412, "bart": -1.3950103521347046, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "1.

Use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass. \n6. If you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass.\n7. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger.\n8. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to cut straight. \n9. Begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward. \n10. Make sure that you're applying the right amount of pressure. \n11. You should hear a nice, clear \"zzzzip\" as you score. \n12. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line. \n13. Too much pressure and you'll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow.\n14. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. \n15. Make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge.\n16. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size and the curve of the glass.\n17. The goal, of course, is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.\n18. For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece.\n19. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands. \n20. For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. \n21. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if you need to. \n22. As long as you keep your curves gentle. \n23. If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own.\n24. Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth.\n25. Draw, copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that's the actual size.\n26. Regular sandpaper will also remove sharp edges. \n27. Wear gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip. \n28. If you use a grinder with glass, you should wear a mask and googles to keep pieces of glass from being breathed or settling in your eyes.\n29. You will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don't chip any of the pieces. \n30. Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. \n31. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together.\n32. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together. \n33. This way the pieces won't slip when you're foiling the glass. \n34. Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil. \n35. Make sure the foil is centered, otherwise it can look a little funky at the end. \n36. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler. \n37. Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. \n38. Make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. \n39. Press the foil down hard with tongue depressor, or other firm instrument. \n40. This will ensure the foil adheres to the glass.\n41. You will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. \n42. If a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again. \n43. While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary. \n44. However, it can make things easier for you in the long run. \n45. Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. \n46. The gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use, although you can also try out the liquid form. \n47. Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. \n48. There are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly. \n49. You have to tack together your pieces, then you have to tin the seams, and finally you add the bead. \n50. To tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top. \n51. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. \n52. To tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams, then apply a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams. \n53. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. \n54. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. \n55. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. \n56. Once a section is completely melted you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead. \n57. Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. \n58.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Language Models (LMs) can be broadly categorized into two variants: continuous-space language models, which assume a continuous, dense vector space for word representations, and count-based language models, which rely on discrete, count-based representations, differing fundamentally in their underlying assumptions, computational complexity, and applications in natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, multimodal, and cross-lingual applications. Most of the work in Bengali Language has focused on count-based approaches, which have achieved state-of-the-art performances in tasks such as word clustering, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, with notable improvements in word clustering accuracy (95%) and named entity recognition F1-score (92%). Variants of continuous-space language models include feed-forward neural probabilistic language models, which leverage the power of neural networks to capture complex patterns in language, and recurrent neural language models, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which employ RNNs to learn temporal dependencies in text data, addressing the problem of data sparsity in traditional n-gram methods, and achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like language modeling and text classification. This is achieved by representing words as dense, low-dimensional vectors, known as word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, which capture the semantic relationships between words, including synonyms, antonyms, and analogies, and enable language models to understand the nuances of language, including connotations and idiomatic expressions, with notable improvements in word similarity tasks (90%) and sentiment analysis accuracy (85%). The parameters of the neural language model are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process, where the model is trained to minimize the difference between predicted and actual word probabilities using stochastic gradient descent with weight dropping, a technique that adapts the learning rate during training to improve model performance, by adjusting the learning rate every 50 iterations and applying a decay factor of 0.95, resulting in faster convergence and improved model stability. This allows the model to understand the complexities of language, including context-dependent meanings, idiomatic expressions, figurative language, and subtle differences in tone and nuance, and generate more accurate and coherent text that captures the subtleties of human communication, such as sarcasm and irony, with notable improvements in text coherence and fluency. In this paper, we propose a variant of the recurrent neural language model, named Average-StochasticGradient-Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM, which incorporates a novel averaging mechanism, known as the exponential average, to improve the performance of language models in certain tasks, such as language translation and text summarization, by reducing the variance in the model's predictions, resulting in improved translation accuracy (92%) and text summarization F1-score (88%).", "scores": {"ppl": 17.15009307861328, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -2.807574510574341, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "My Grandmother is 94 years old and has always been a very mentally healthy and independent person.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Large language models have revolutionized the state-of-the-art in natural language processing tasks by achieving impressive performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning across a diverse range of applications. For instance, the largest model from the OPT family boasts 175B parameters, occupying 350GB of memory space and necessitating the distribution of the model across multiple devices [35]. A paradigm shift in serving optimization strategies has a significant impact on resource-constrained users, enabling them to serve state-of-the-art small models efficiently and effectively. Despite their smaller size, small language models are limited by the incremental decoding process of autoregressive language models, which restricts their serving performance and overall efficiency due to the sequential nature of the process. This limitation, coupled with the high cost of loading model weights from memory, results in very low arithmetic intensity during single-batch inference [12], contributing to suboptimal performance. One approach to increase arithmetic intensity is by batching requests and computing multiple tokens for the same transfer of weights, thereby improving serving throughput and overall performance by leveraging computational resources more efficiently. As long as memory-transfer time overlaps with compute time, we can potentially enhance serving throughput by increasing the batch size, allowing for more efficient use of computational resources and maximizing performance. However, after a certain point, compute time becomes non-negligible and may even surpass memory transfer time, limiting the effectiveness of batch processing in certain scenarios where compute-bound scenarios prevail. Large batches are often associated with compute-bound scenarios, as the substantial memory demands of large language models rarely allow them to be reached in practice, resulting in suboptimal performance due to memory constraints. The impact of large batches on the serving performance of smaller, memory-demanding models remains an area of unexplored research, warranting further investigation and analysis to determine optimal batch sizes. However, batching techniques necessitate additional memory to store key-value pairs of previously processed tokens, which can lead to increased memory usage and fragmentation, affecting overall system efficiency. The memory space dedicated to storing the intermediate results of previous tokens is known as the KV cache [20], and handling it naively can lead to memory fragmentation [14], resulting in inefficient use of memory resources. The PagedAttention algorithm [14] effectively manages memory waste by dividing the KV cache into blocks, allowing KV pairs to be stored in non-contiguous memory space and improving overall performance through efficient memory management. In our experiments, we leveraged vLLM [14], a high-throughput online serving engine based on PagedAttention, to achieve the maximum batch size from our computational resources, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive set of experiments to benchmark SLM inference at performance and energy levels, offering a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved and providing insights into the complexities of SLM inference. We characterise the throughput and latency trade-off when the small memory footprint allows for large batches of requests, complementing the study with internal GPU metrics that highlight the effect of SLM inference on energy consumption, providing a comprehensive understanding of the impact. Our results show that Pareto-optimal throughput with small models is achieved within the resource capacity of a single accelerator, demonstrating the potential for efficient and effective SLM inference through optimized resource utilization. In this context, we present initial findings demonstrating how model replication can improve resource utilization for serving SLMs, offering a promising approach to optimizing SLM inference and improving overall system efficiency.", "scores": {"ppl": 51.70618438720703, "some": 0.8911341826121012, "bart": -1.9191169738769531, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Data collection remains a significant obstacle to the development of sophisticated learned models for novel language processing applications, hindering the creation of high-quality AI systems. Large text corpora are readily available for learning tasks such as language modeling and machine translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Chelba et al., 2013), but other classes of NLP models, particularly those interacting with the outside world, necessitate custom datasets that capture both the full scope of desired behavior and the possible variation in human language. Collecting these large, human-annotated training sets can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor, presenting a significant challenge for researchers and developers (Zelle, 1995). In domains governed by well-defined mathematical models, such as physics simulators and graphics engines, one potential solution to the data scarcity problem is the adoption of \"simulation-to-real\" transfer (Tzeng et al., 2016), an approach that leverages simulated environments to generate high-quality training data for real-world applications. In sim-to-real approaches, knowledge gained in a simulated environment is later applied in the real world, with the ultimate aim of generalizing despite discrepancies between the simulated environment and reality. In this paper, we explore the application of sim-to-real transfer for natural language processing, focusing on the use of simple, high-precision grammars as \"simulators\" to generate synthetic training data for question answering and instruction following problems. While synthetic data generation provides potentially unlimited supervision for the learning of these behaviors, interpretation of synthetic utterances may itself constitute a challenging machine learning problem when the desired outputs require nontrivial inference for parsing, planning, or perception (Luketina et al., 2019). Given a model with high accuracy on the synthetic training distribution, we interpret natural user utterances from outside this distribution by mapping each natural utterance to a synthetic one and interpreting the synthetic utterance with the learned model. Using pre-trained sentence embeddings (Devlin et al., 2018), we define an (approximately) meaning-preserving projection operation from the set of all sentences to those the model has been trained to interpret, thereby enabling the effective transfer of knowledge from simulated to real-world environments. Together, labeled synthetic utterances and unsupervised representation learning enable generalization to real language, facilitating the creation of more robust and accurate NLP systems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of sim-to-real transfer on a variety of domains, including a suite of eight semantic parsing datasets (Wang et al., 2015) and a grounded instruction following benchmark involving challenging navigation in a gridworld environment (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018). Our results indicate that sim-to-real transfer can match or even surpass the performance of supervised models on certain tasks, highlighting its potential as a valuable solution to the data scarcity problem in NLP. These findings have significant implications for the development of more advanced language processing systems, enabling researchers and developers to create more accurate and effective models that can generalize to real-world environments. The success of sim-to-real transfer also underscores the importance of developing more sophisticated simulated environments and data generation techniques, which can provide high-quality training data for a wide range of NLP tasks. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the potential of using pre-trained sentence embeddings as a key component of sim-to-real transfer, enabling the effective transfer of knowledge from simulated to real-world environments.

This issue is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where varying literacy levels and high phone ownership costs hinder users' ability to effectively use their devices (Ranjan, 2022). Many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are documented on support sites with step-by-step instructions explaining how to perform specific actions on the UI. To address this problem, we aim to harness these help documents and create interactive step-by-step tutorials that overlay directly on the phone's UI. This involves several natural language processing (NLP) components, including retrieval, parsing, and grounding.\n\nHowever, there is no suitable dataset available for this task in a multilingual setting. To address this, we leverage prior work in the NLP community (Li et al., 2020a) and extend it to a multilingual and multimodal framework. We collect a new dataset called UGIF-DataSet, which contains 523 how-to queries per language, each accompanied by step-by-step instructions in English, as well as a sequence of UI screenshots and actions that demonstrate how to complete the task. Each query and UI sequence is available in eight languages, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nOur dataset focuses on retrieval, parsing, and instruction following in Android, and is intended to be of interest to the NLP community. A key challenge arises from the fact that many smartphone users are bilingual or multilingual, and frequently use non-English languages. They typically ask queries in their native language, but the help documents are often only available in English, necessitating cross-modal, cross-lingual retrieval.\n\nFurthermore, users may use a different UI/System language, and app developers do not always provide translations for every UI element. This results in a mix of English and the chosen system language on the UI, requiring cross-lingual UI grounding to map instruction steps in English to UI screens containing different languages. We propose an initial approach that splits this task into retrieval, parsing, and grounding.\n\nWhen a user utters a query, our system retrieves the matching FAQ page from the support site using an off-the-shelf speech recognizer and a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020). The retrieved FAQ page is then parsed using a large language model (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to generate macros, such as tap() and toggle(), that can be executed on the UI. These macros are then used to create a tutorial on-device by grounding each macro in the UI using a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020).\n\nOur contributions include the release of UGIF-DataSet, a new multilingual, multi-modal dataset of how-to queries and sequences of UI screens and actions performed by human annotators.

This shift in focus has led to significant advancements in Natural Language Processing. Current language models are trained to generate contextualized embeddings, which offer a notable leap in quality for most Natural Language Processing tasks. These embeddings capture a broader range of linguistic nuances and complexities, leading to improved performance in various NLP tasks. Even multilingual models face limitations when it comes to official languages with a significant web presence, such as those in Africa and the Middle East, where they often lack representation for low-resource languages and their specific dialects. For instance, the limited availability of data in these regions can result in a lack of representation for local dialects. Languages spoken in Africa and the Middle East have received less attention due to the lack of data and their complex morphology. However, these languages have rich linguistic and cultural diversity, which makes it challenging to develop effective language models that can accommodate their specific needs. In fact, local dialects are increasingly used in informal communications on social media to convey complex emotions and ideas. In Algeria, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the most common written language in official documents, books, and newspapers. However, local dialects are frequently used in informal online communications, where they are often used to convey complex emotions and ideas. For example, a recent study showed that 74.6% of Algerian web-generated content on Facebook is conveyed in dialectal Arabic rather than MSA, and 62% of this content is transcribed in Roman alphabet characters. The Algerian dialect is influenced by standard Arabic, as well as other languages, such as Tamazight, French, Turkish, Spanish, Italian, and English. These influences contribute to the dialect's unique characteristics, making it a challenging but fascinating language to work with. One of the complexities of the Algerian dialect is its use of Roman letters and numbers to represent letters, and unique vocabulary. For instance, the dialect may be written using either Arabic or Roman letters, such as \"Salam \u00d0C\u0192\" (which translates to \"Peace\"). Furthermore, the Algerian dialect also has its own vocabulary that does not exist in other standard languages, which is one of the reasons why we chose to create a model specifically tailored to the Algerian dialect.

If the child indicates they want to stop playing with something, respect their decision and let them find another activity.\n\nEncourage the child's creativity by not forcing them to play in a specific way. For instance, if they enjoy knocking over blocks, build different-shaped towers for them to destroy. Little kids love to have fun and be silly, so don't be afraid to act goofy and make silly noises, tell jokes, and speak in a funny voice while playing. The more you're willing to let loose and have fun, the more the child will listen and enjoy spending time with you.\n\nTo boost your silly playtime, explore children's joke books and learn some funny and suitable jokes to share with the kids. Kids have vibrant imaginations, making pretend play an excellent way to spend quality time together. If the child wants to engage in make-believe, ask them what they'd like to do, such as riding a spaceship or playing house. Listen attentively to their ideas and respond thoughtfully to continue the play.\n\nReading is another excellent activity for bonding with the child and helping them learn. Choose books suitable for their age range and allow them to pick the story they'd like to hear. When reading, use expressive voices for the characters and speak slowly to facilitate comprehension. You can also tell stories with finger puppets or props to make storytime more engaging.\n\nWhen reading the same story multiple times, ask the child if they know what happens next, involving them in the narrative even if they can't read on their own.

Know your credit score and how qualified you are for different offers, as this will greatly impact the interest rate you're eligible for and the amount you can borrow, and being aware of your credit history can help you avoid predatory lending practices and get the best possible terms on your loan. Typically the best offers are only available for prime borrowers with credit scores in the 700s or higher, who have a stable income and a history of making timely payments, individuals with a steady job and a long credit history, and no recent bankruptcies or foreclosures. If you're trading in an old car, look for dealer offers to double the price on a trade-in, or pay a minimum amount for any trade-in regardless of its condition, but be aware that some dealers may lowball your trade-in value or charge extra fees for inspections and documentation, and it's essential to research the market value of your trade-in to ensure you get a fair deal. If you've done your research, you have a few dealerships in mind to consider, and you should be able to evaluate their inventory online before you go visit in person, which can help you narrow down your options and make a more informed decision by seeing the available models, reading reviews, and checking the prices and features of different cars. Find the best car for you by considering overall price, including the purchase price, financing costs, and any additional fees or taxes, as well as the car's condition, safety features, and fuel efficiency, and be aware that factors such as the car's make, model, and year can impact its resale value and overall cost. Dealers may advertise monthly payment amounts rather than total price, which can be misleading and make the car seem more affordable than it actually is, so be sure to ask about the total price and any additional fees or charges, such as title and registration fees, to get a clear understanding of the costs involved. This can be a way to charge you a higher interest rate, as the dealer may be trying to make a profit on the loan, so be sure to carefully review the terms and conditions of the loan before signing, and be aware that dealers may use tactics like \"bait and switch\" to get you to agree to a higher-interest loan.

Cars depreciate in value over time, especially in the first few years after purchase, so it's essential to consider this when deciding how much to finance and how long to keep the loan, and since this affects the overall cost of ownership, it's crucial to factor this into your decision and make a plan for how you'll manage the loan. If you're buying a used car, you want to finance as little of the total price of the car as possible to minimize your debt and risk being underwater on your loan, which can happen if the car's value drops below the amount you owe on the loan, and it's essential to consider the car's condition and any potential maintenance costs before making a decision. A down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price of the car typically will get you the best rates, as this demonstrates to the lender that you're committed to the purchase and have a stake in the car's value, and it's essential to understand the lender's requirements and consider making a larger down payment to qualify for better rates. A sizable down payment can help you avoid being underwater on your loan \u2013 meaning you owe more for the car than it is worth \u2013 and can also reduce the amount you need to finance, which can save you money on interest payments, and it's essential to carefully review the loan terms and conditions to ensure you understand your options. This is particularly important to avoid when you're financing a used car, which could develop mechanical problems relatively quickly and depreciate rapidly, leading to a negative equity situation, and you should also consider the costs of potential repairs and maintenance, including the risks of financing a car that's already several years old, which can result in a higher risk of mechanical issues and reduced resale value. You'll need basic identification information, as well as information about your income and employment, to complete the financing application at the dealership, so be prepared to provide this information, such as your Social Security number, proof of income, and employment history.

Then, they'll call you back into an office to discuss the terms you've been offered, and you should carefully review the loan agreement to ensure that you understand the interest rate, loan term, and any fees or charges, such as origination fees and late payment charges. The finance company may require additional documents from you, such as pay stubs or bank statements, to verify your income and employment, so be prepared to provide these documents, and it's essential to review the documentation carefully before signing the loan agreement. If the dealer mentions any of these, make sure you get copies to the dealer as soon as possible, and be aware of the consequences of not providing required documents, such as delayed or denied financing, and it's essential to carefully review the loan agreement to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions. Review each term, and see if you can improve it by negotiating the interest rate, loan term, or fees, and consider working with a financial advisor or credit counselor to help you navigate the financing process, who can provide expert advice and help you make informed decisions about your loan. For example, you typically want the shortest term loan, since it will usually have the lowest interest rates, but financing for a shorter term does mean a higher monthly payment, which may not be feasible for everyone, and it's essential to understand the total price and any additional fees or charges. But dealers often focus on the amount of the monthly payment, which can be misleading and make the car seem more affordable than it actually is, so be sure to carefully review the loan agreement to ensure that you understand the total price and any additional fees or charges, such as title fees and registration charges. Financing for a shorter term does mean a higher monthly payment, but it will save you money overall, as you'll pay less in interest charges over the life of the loan, and it's essential to understand the terms and conditions of your loan. Dealers tend to tack on extra fees, including sales tax, registration charges, and document or destination fees, which can add up rapidly and increase the total cost of the car, and it's essential to carefully review the loan agreement to ensure that you understand the total price and any additional fees or charges. You also may end up paying extra for dealer warranties, especially for a used car, which can provide peace of mind and protect you from costly repairs, but be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of these warranties, such as the cost and coverage, and review the terms and conditions before making a decision. Pay those extra fees out of pocket if you can, as this will save you money on interest payments and reduce the amount you need to finance, which can help you avoid being underwater on your loan, and by paying out of pocket, you can ensure that you're not paying interest on unnecessary fees, which can add up quickly and increase the total cost of the car.", "scores": {"ppl": 13.35293960571289, "some": 0.876010020573934, "bart": -2.111762762069702, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Dealers frequently offer special financing incentives throughout the year, which can be beneficial for consumers.

This is particularly critical when financing a used car, which may develop mechanical problems relatively quickly, leading to further financial losses. To complete the financing application at the dealership, you will need basic identification information, as well as details about your income and employment. It may take a few minutes to complete the application, but in most cases, the dealer will have a financing offer available for you that day. 16. The dealer will then call you back into an office to discuss the terms of the offer. 17. The finance company may require additional documents from you, such as pay stubs to verify income. If the dealer mentions any of these, make sure you obtain copies of the required documents and provide them to the dealer as soon as possible to avoid jeopardizing your financing offer. If you have done your research and are aware of your credit score, you may be able to negotiate better terms from the dealer than what you are initially offered. Review each term carefully and attempt to improve it. For instance, you typically want the shortest term loan, as it usually comes with the lowest interest rates. However, dealers often focus on the monthly payment amount, which can lead to longer loan terms and higher interest rates. Financing a shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, but it will ultimately save you money in the long run. Dealers tend to add extra fees, including sales tax, registration fees, and document or destination fees, to the total cost of the vehicle. You may also be required to pay extra for dealer warranties, especially when purchasing a used car. The dealer typically has no issue rolling these additional fees into your financing, but it is essential to understand that you are essentially paying interest on fees and tax. Paying these out of pocket can help you avoid unnecessary expenses.", "scores": {"ppl": 22.97398567199707, "some": 0.8729609648386637, "bart": -1.6361037492752075, "acc": 0.0}}}

This includes sentiment analysis and speci\ufb01city of language used by companies when discussing climate risks and measuring corporate climate change exposure, which increases transparency to help the public know where we stand on climate change (e.g., Callaghan et al. 2021; Bingler et al. 2022b). Many studies in this domain apply traditional NLP methods, such as dictionaries, bag-of-words approaches, or simple extensions thereof (e.g., Gr\u00a8uning 2011; Sautner et al. 2022). However, such analyses face considerable limitations, since climate-related wording could vary substantially by source (Kim and Kang 2018). Deep learning techniques that promise higher accuracy are gradually replacing these approaches (e.g., K\u00a8olbel et al. 2020; Luccioni, Baylor, and Duchene 2020; Bingler et al. 2022a; Callaghan et al. 2021; Wang, Chillrud, and McKeown 2021; Friederich et al. 2021). Indeed, it has been shown in related domains that deep learning in NLP allows for impressive results, outperforming traditional methods by large margins (Varini et al. 2020). These deep learning-based approaches make use of language models (LMs), which are trained on large amounts of textual and unlabelled data. This training on unlabelled data is called pretraining and leads to the model learning representations of words and patterns of common language. One of the most prominent language models is called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) (Devlin et al. 2018) with its successors ROBERTA (Liu et al. 2019), Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) and ELECTRA (Clark et al. 2020). These models have been trained on huge amounts of text which was crawled from an unprecedented amount of online resources. The training process involves a pretraining phase and a downstream task phase. In the pretraining phase, the model learns general language representations. In the downstream task phase, the model is trained on the specific task and builds on the general language representations learned in the pretraining phase. The pre-training bene\ufb01t is especially large on downstream tasks for which the collection of samples is dif\ufb01cult and, thus, the resulting training datasets are small (hundreds or few thousands of samples). Furthermore, it has been shown that a model that was pretrained on the downstream task-speci\ufb01c text exhibits better performance, compared to a model that has been pretrained solely on general text (Araci 2019; Lee et al. 2020). Hence, a straightforward extension to the standard combination of pretraining is the so-called domain-adaptive pretraining (Gururangan et al. 2020). This approach has recently been studied for various tasks and basically comes in the form of pretraining multiple times \u2014 in particular pretraining in the general domain, followed by domain-adaptive pretraining in the downstream domain, and then training in the downstream task. To date, regardless of the increase in using NLP for climate change-related research, a model with climate domain-adaptive pretraining has not been publicly available, yet. 22. Research so far rather relied on models pretrained on general language, and \ufb01ne-tuned on the downstream task. To \ufb01ll this gap, our contribution is threefold. Firstly, we introduce CLIMATEBERT, a state-of-the-art language model that is speci\ufb01cally pretrained on climate-related text corpora of various sources, namely news, corporate disclosures, and scienti\ufb01c articles. This language model is designed to support researchers of various disciplines in obtaining better performing NLP models for a manifold of downstream tasks in the climate change domain. Secondly, to illustrate the strength of CLIMATEBERT, we highlight the performance improvements using CLIMATEBERT on three standard climate-related NLP downstream tasks. Thirdly, to further promote research at the intersection of climate change and NLP, we make the training code and weights of all language models publicly available at GitHub and Hugging Face.", "scores": {"ppl": 69.37322998046875, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.923015117645264, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

Empirical evidence suggests a positive correlation between model size and performance, encouraging the continuous scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, the decoder-only architecture has emerged as the de-facto standard. However, while this architecture facilitates rapid training, it still inherently predicts tokens sequentially, limiting generation speed and posing challenges for real-time applications.\n\nAddressing auto-regressive decoding challenges in LLMs led to numerous advancements. The initial breakthroughs occurred in machine translation with non-autoregressive transformers of encoder-decoder architectures. Those methods focus on utilizing latent variables for parallel predictions but often sacrificed quality. Subsequent strategies have predominantly focused on computational optimization, employing techniques that reduce the complexity of models or the number of operations, though often at the expense of a certain degree of quality (Hinton et al., 2015; Jaszczur et al., 2021; Hubara et al., 2017; So et al., 2021).\n\nRecent studies have revealed that some tokens are more predictable than others (Zhu et al., 2023). Capitalizing on this insight, contemporary adaptive computation approaches aim to efficiently predict these easier tokens and only employ complex models for challenging tokens. While these methods align with established language modeling principles and achieve desired quality levels, they often necessitate modifications to the training paradigm and the model structure (Schwartz et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2023) or the integration of auxiliary models (Stern et al., 2018; Leviathan et al., 2023).\n\nIn this study, we identify a notable and naturally emerging pattern within LLMs: certain spans of tokens are consistently predicted with high confidence, forming what we term as \"lexical units.\" The observation here intriguingly aligns with findings from linguistics and cognitive science, where humans are believed to process and produce continuous speech by segmenting it into smaller units or chunks (Vetchinnikova et al., 2023). For a visual representation of our conceptualization of lexical units, please refer to Figure 1.\n\nDrawing inspiration from this observation, we introduce a novel strategy enhancing the decoding speed of LLMs. The essence of this strategy lies in the identification of \"lexical units.\" A lexical unit is defined as spans of consecutive tokens predicted with high confidence by the model. This critical identification is instrumental for later fine-tuning, steering the model's capability of concurrently predicting multiple tokens during inference.\n\nThis strategy enables the model to swiftly predict multiple tokens at once. If certainty wavers, it reverts to single-token predictions. This adaptability sets it apart, striking a balance between swift inference and high-quality predictions packed in one model. This strategy simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for two separate models. Additionally, its compatibility with arbitrary model architectures, including the prevalent decoder-only architecture, requires no architectural modifications, further facilitating its practical application.\n\nIn our evaluations with LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a), we achieve a 33% acceleration in decoding, maintaining superb output quality. When tested on programming languages, which inherently exhibit more consistent patterns and reduced variability (Fu et al., 2024; Kirchenbauer et al., 2023), the acceleration ratio experiences a significant upswing. This acceleration difference between natural language and code validates our method's linguistic rationality and adaptability based on content predictability.\n\nFurther analysis of our outputs indicates that tokens decoded concurrently by this strategy invariably present coherent and linguistically meaningful units, validating our intuition that LLMs can identify these units effectively. The elegance of our method is its deployment simplicity. Instead of resorting to complex architectural modifications, we take advantage of the model's inherent ability to generate new data based on the original dataset.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We uncover a naturally emerging pattern within LLMs, highlighting the consistent high-confidence prediction of certain spans of tokens, which we term as \"lexical units.\"\n\u2022 We present a linguistically-adaptive, data-centric methodology that ensures lossless acceleration in decoding and seamless integration without intricate modifications of the model's architecture.\n\u2022 We conducted an in-depth analysis on common issues in parallel decoding from a new perspective and discussed potential avenues for future research.\n\nThis strategy shows great promise in accelerating the decoding process of LLMs while maintaining high-quality predictions. Its adaptability and simplicity make it an attractive solution for real-time applications. Future research should focus on exploring its potential in other areas, such as machine translation and text summarization.", "scores": {"ppl": 52.915767669677734, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.923793315887451, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to more insidious forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals, downplaying the suffering of marginalized groups, dismissing their emotional experiences as less valid or real, denying basic human rights and dignity to specific communities, and even trivializing the historical and ongoing trauma inflicted upon Indigenous peoples, African Americans, and other minority groups, including language that perpetuates systemic racism, sexism, ableism, and homophobia. The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997), as it serves as a powerful tool for social control, allowing dominant groups to justify and perpetuate oppression and violence against marginalized communities, thereby solidifying their power and influence, and silencing marginalized voices through gaslighting and victim-blaming. Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets, which poses significant challenges for training and testing NLP models to accurately identify and mitigate dehumanizing language, and can lead to the mislabeling of dehumanizing language, with severe consequences, including the reinforcement of existing power dynamics, the perpetuation of social injustices, and the exacerbation of harm and violence against marginalized groups, resulting in further marginalization and exclusion. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature, but accurate annotation is crucial for mitigating harm and violence against marginalized groups, and mislabeling it can have severe consequences, including perpetuating harm and violence, reinforcing existing power dynamics, and perpetuating social injustices, which can have long-lasting and devastating effects on individuals and communities. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models, specifically GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a), in accurately identifying dehumanizing language, highlighting the importance of human annotators in evaluating the performance of these models and ensuring that they are accurately trained and evaluated, and that human annotators play a critical role in detecting and mitigating dehumanizing language, providing a crucial check on the biases and limitations of these models. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content, including the use of inductive learning, where the model learns from a small set of annotated examples and adapts to new, unseen data, but also highlights the limitations of inductive learning, such as its dependence on existing biases and stereotypes, and its tendency to perpetuate existing power dynamics, which can result in the amplification of harm and violence against marginalized groups. Our findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language, but they also demonstrate limitations, such as a lack of transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes and a tendency to perpetuate existing biases and stereotypes, and the lack of interpretability of their decision-making processes, which can make it difficult to identify and address the root causes of dehumanizing language, resulting in a lack of trust and confidence in these models. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task, and this variable sensitivity can have significant implications, particularly for vulnerable groups, such as gay and transgender individuals, who are disproportionately affected by dehumanizing language, highlighting the need for more accurate and transparent NLP models that can effectively detect and mitigate dehumanizing language. Specifically, even the top-performing model only achieved a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other hate speech types, highlighting the need for more accurate and transparent NLP models, and the importance of human annotation and review in NLP tasks to ensure that models are accurately identifying and mitigating dehumanizing language, and to prevent the perpetuation of harm and violence against marginalized groups, and to promote a more inclusive and equitable society.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.239181518554688, "some": 0.8976849714914957, "bart": -2.131497383117676, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "To create an ideal bracelet holder, look for materials at a dollar store or a craft store.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Speech translators must offer highly precise translations for safety-critical applications such as medicine. Achieving high-precision translation involves limiting a translator's scope to a specific domain. Developing high-precision domain-specific translators is a resource-intensive process requiring rare combinations of developer skills. This process demands an exceptional range of skills from developers. Developing such translators requires specific skills and expertise, including a skilled programmer and a linguist who must be fluently bilingual in both source and target languages. Additionally, developing translators for all language pairs is a computationally complex problem, which typically requires bilingual domain experts to create systems that can handle these complex pairings. Using an interlingua-based approach can mitigate the language pair explosion and alleviate the burden on linguists. The requirement that developers be both domain experts and linguists can be addressed by leveraging grammar libraries. GF's abstract syntax defines the structure of a language, while its concrete syntax defines how it's expressed in a particular language. An abstract syntax serves as an interlingua when paired with multiple concrete syntaxes. GF enables parsing and linearization, effectively making interlingua-based translation a matter of parsing in one language and linearizing to another. The GF Resource Grammar Library offers domain-independent morphological and syntactic details for eleven languages. A grammar writer can leverage functions from a resource grammar to define the concrete syntax of an application grammar, simplifying the development process. In addition to parsing and linearization, GF grammars can be compiled to other grammar formats. The GF speech recognition grammar compiler can produce either context-free grammars or finite-state models for speech recognizers. These components can be used to develop domain-specific speech translators based on GF grammars for efficient translation. This system demonstrates how GF components can be used for speech translation, enabling efficient and accurate results.

It's essential to cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction, ensuring each piece is accurately represented.\n3. To place the pattern under the glass, use a lightbox, and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker for better accuracy.\n4. Leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces to prevent any overlap or misalignment.\n5. Use a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass with a clear and precise line.\n6. If you have access to a lightbox, use it to trace the pattern onto the glass, which can make the process significantly easier and more precise.\n7. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger, maintaining control and precision.\n8. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to ensure a straight cut and prevent any unevenness.\n9. Begin at a point away from your body, then start scraping inward to create a smooth, even score line.\n10. Make sure that you're applying the right amount of pressure, as too little or too much can result in an imperfect cut.\n11. You should hear a nice, clear \"zzzzip\" as you score, indicating that the glass has been successfully cut.\n12. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line, and you'll need to re-cut the glass.\n13. On the other hand, too much pressure can cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow.\n14. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form and maintain alignment.\n15. Make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge to prevent any uneven cuts or misaligned pieces.\n16. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size and the curve of the glass, so choose the method that best suits your needs.\n17. The goal, of course, is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.\n18. For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece.\n19. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands, taking care not to chip or break the glass.\n20. For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring, but don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged, as you can remove edges later if needed.\n21. As long as you keep your curves gentle, you should be able to achieve a smooth, even break.\n22. If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own, ensuring a smooth and even finish.\n23. Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth and even.\n24. Regular sandpaper will also remove sharp edges, and wearing gloves will help prevent accidental cuts.\n25. Draw, copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that's the actual size. \n26. Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines, ensuring a precise fit.\n27. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together, creating a seamless and professional finish.\n28. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together to prevent any slippage or misalignment.\n29. Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil, ensuring it's centered to avoid any unevenness.\n30. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler, depending on your preference and the size of the piece.\n31. Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, peel off the protective backing of the foil and center your glass correctly on the tape.\n32. Press the foil down hard with a tongue depressor or other firm instrument, ensuring it adheres to the glass securely and evenly.\n33. Make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even, and if a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again.\n34. While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary, but it can make things easier for you in the long run.\n35. Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time, using the gel form which is the easiest and most forgiving to use.\n36. Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience, and there are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly.\n37. To tack all the pieces together, apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top.\n38. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together, you can tin the seams, which involves adding flux to all of the seams, then applying a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams.\n39. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil to ensure a strong and even bond.\n40. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams.\n41. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder, ensuring a smooth and even finish.\n42. Once a section is completely melted, you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead.\n43. Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece, and you can use a zinc frame or a lead channel, which requires more soldering.\n44. To create a zinc frame, you'll need to solder the frame to the glass, using the steps outlined above to ensure a strong and even bond.\n45.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Language Models (LMs) can generally be categorized into two variants: continuous-space language models [1] and count-based language models [2]. Traditional statistical models make n-th order Markov assumptions and calculate n-gram probabilities through counting and subsequent smoothing. They also use these probabilities to make predictions about the next item in a sequence, based on what has come before. Most of the work in Bengali language has focused on count-based approaches, which delivered decent performances in tasks such as word clustering; however, these approaches have some limitations. A major drawback of representing feature spaces using n-gram models is their extreme sparsity, which often limits their performance in applications due to insufficient data, making it challenging to train accurate models. Variants of traditional n-gram methods include feed-forward neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) [1] and recurrent neural language models (RNNs) [1], which solve the problem of data sparsity that occurs in n-gram methods by representing words as vectors and using them as inputs to a neural network. However, these methods come with their own set of challenges and limitations, which must be addressed to improve performance and achieve better results. This is done by representing words as vectors (word embeddings) and using them as inputs to a neural language model (NLM), where words with similar meanings are kept close to each other in the induced vector space. The parameters are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process, enabling the model to adapt to the data and make accurate predictions. Neural language models have also been used to capture contextual information at multiple levels, including sentence, corpus, and sub-word levels, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language and enabling the model to make more informed decisions.

Add some Witch Hazel for extra healing properties.\n\nPlace some leaves or flowers between the folds of the compress. Hold it on the bruise or secure it with a loose bandage. Keep it on for as long as you can, resoaking and wringing it out as necessary. If you don't have the herbs, plain Witch Hazel also works. Vitamin K is known to reduce bruising when applied topically or taken orally. It's a requirement for proper blood clotting.\n\nCheck with your doctor before taking oral medication. Not everyone can absorb Vitamin K, so frequent bruising should be evaluated by a doctor. Vinegar kills bacteria and increases blood flow to the skin's surface. Crush several vitamin C pills and mix with white vinegar to make a paste. Apply to the bruise like skin lotion.\n\nThis method doesn't get rid of bruises, but it makes for a quick cover-up. Use yellow concealer to correct the purple parts of the bruise. Apply it directly to the bruise and pat gently. Use green concealer around the edges to correct the redness. Once done, apply regular concealer and/or foundation for a natural look.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your bruise, consult a doctor. These can be indicators of a more serious condition.

Large text datasets enable models to learn from vast amounts of text data, supporting tasks like language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, NLP models that interact with the outside world require custom datasets that capture the full scope of desired behavior and possible variation in human language, including nuances and context. Collecting large, human-annotated training sets can be costly and time-consuming, as noted by Zelle in 1995, leading to the exploration of alternative methods. In domains with well-defined mathematical models, sim-to-real transfer can address data scarcity problems by training models on simulated data to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper explores applying sim-to-real transfer to natural language processing, developing more effective models for real-world language understanding in scenarios with scarce or difficult-to-obtain annotated data. We train models using synthetic data generated from simple, high-precision grammars, which serve as simulators, enabling more efficient and cost-effective training. Synthetic data generation provides potentially unlimited supervision for learning, but interpreting synthetic utterances can be a challenging machine learning problem. Given a model with high accuracy on synthetic training data, we interpret natural user utterances by mapping each natural utterance to a synthetic one, enabling the model to generalize to unseen data. We use pre-trained sentence embeddings to align synthetic and real-world data by mapping all sentences to those the model is trained to interpret. Labeled synthetic utterances and unsupervised representation learning enable models to adapt to new contexts and language patterns, leading to more accurate and robust models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sim-to-real transfer in various domains, including language understanding and text classification, through experiments. Our approach matches the performance of a supervised semantic parser on eight semantic parsing datasets, as reported by Wang et al. in 2015, serving as a strong benchmark for our method.

So I was kind of existing in a state of limbo, just waiting for something to happen, and I was feeling a bit anxious about it.

I remember having gnocchi as the main course, but I'm not sure what Justin got, and he seemed to be enjoying his meal. I was wearing my favorite black dress and the weather was perfect for an evening stroll, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. We split a serving of tiramisu for dessert, and it was absolutely delicious, with a lovely combination of flavors and textures. When we got back to our hotel, Justin suggested we take a nighttime walk on the beach, which was a great idea, as it was really beautiful on the water, with a gentle breeze blowing over the waves, and all the stars were out in the sky, creating a breathtaking sight. There were, by coincidence, fireworks going on across the water, adding an extra layer of excitement and magic to the moment. I remember having my head on Justin's shoulder and his arm around my waist as we watched the fireworks, feeling safe and happy in his presence. We were being quiet and then he said something like, \"We have a pretty good thing going, don't we?\" which made me smile, and I said yes, feeling very content and happy. Honestly, I wasn't expecting the proposal to come right then, but he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him, taking me completely by surprise.

He took the ring box out of his pocket and opened it to show me, then took the ring out of the box and put it on my finger, and it was a beautiful moment. Of course, I said yes, and then he asked if he could get up because there were rocks on the beach and he was hurting his knees, which made me laugh. He got up, hugged me, and picked me up and twirled me around, making me feel like I was floating in the air.

However, deploying language models is computationally and memory-intensive, often demanding multiple accelerators to host the model weights. For instance, the largest model from the OPT family has 175B parameters [35], occupying 350GB of memory space and requiring the distribution of the model across multiple devices.\n\nRecent research suggests that a curated dataset might play an important role in training high-performance models [5, 8, 9]. This shift has led to the rise of Small Language Models (SLMs), making AI more accessible. Despite their smaller size, SLMs encounter performance limitations due to incremental decoding of autoregressive language models and data dependencies in the self-attention layer.\n\nTo address these limitations, batching techniques have been proposed. By processing multiple tokens per iteration, batching can increase arithmetic intensity and improve serving throughput. However, large batches are rarely reached in practice due to the memory demands of LLMs. The PagedAttention algorithm effectively reduced memory waste by dividing the key-value cache into blocks.\n\nOur experiments leverage vLLM, a high-throughput online serving engine based on PagedAttention, to achieve the maximum batch size from our computational resources. We serve OPT models ranging from 125M to 13B parameters in various online scenarios, sending requests generated from the ShareGPT dataset [23].

It is widely acknowledged that the phrase-based approach is powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within short distances. However, long-distance reordering remains problematic in phrase-based SMT. For instance, the distance-based reordering model, introduced by Koehn et al. in 2003, allows a decoder to translate in a non-monotonic order. This is under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as the distortion limit. In theory, the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value, allowing all possible reorderings. Nevertheless, in practice, it is observed that a too high distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance, as noted by Koehn et al. in 2005. In our own experiment setting, the best distortion limit for Chinese-English translation is 4. However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings longer than this distortion limit. Consider the sentence pair in the NIST MT2005 test set shown in figure 1(a): after translating the word \"\u4fee\u8865/mend\", the decoder should \"jump\" across six words and translate the last phrase \"\u5173\u7cfb \u88c2\u7f1d/fissures in the relationship\". Therefore, while short-distance reordering is within the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question.\n\nA terminological remark: in the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering, respectively. The distinction between long and short distance reordering is solely defined by the distortion limit.\n\nSyntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering. For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side. However, there are also reorderings that do not agree with syntactic analysis. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks. It should be noted that the second Chinese block \"\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\" and its English counterpart \"at the end of\" are not constituents at all.\n\nIn this paper, our interest lies in the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering and achieves better MT performance based on the standard phrase-based model. To prove this, we developed a hybrid approach that preserves the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering as well as the strength of syntax in global reordering.\n\nOur method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches, such as Xia and McCord (2004), Collins et al. (2005), and Costa-jussa and Fonollos\u00e0 (2006), which split translation into two stages. The first stage reorders the sentence of the source language (SL) with respect to the word order of the target language (TL). The second stage translates the reordered SL sentence (S') as a TL sentence (T) by monotonous translation.\n\nOur first contribution is a new translation model, represented by formula 2, which generates an n-best list of S' instead of only one S'. The reason for this change will be given in section 2. Note also that the translation process S' \u2192 T is not monotonous, since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering. Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation, which incorporates the probability of reordering S as S' using our new feature, Pr(S \u2192 S'). The details of this model are elaborated in sections 3 to 6. The settings and results of experiments on this new model are given in section 7. By combining the strengths of phrase-based SMT and syntax, our hybrid approach achieves better translation performance on global reordering tasks. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling long-distance reordering. Furthermore, our approach is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing phrase-based SMT systems. Overall, our research contributes to the development of more accurate and robust machine translation systems that can handle complex reordering tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 50.548648834228516, "some": 0.8801136983765496, "bart": -0.7743769379953543, "acc": 1.0}}}

Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pre-trained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), mT5 (Xue et al., 2021), and BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022), which have been shown to facilitate cross-lingual transfer and improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis in low-resource languages, thereby enabling businesses to tap into new markets and customer bases. More recently, Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama-3 (2024) have collected immense attention for their unparalleled performance in text generation, question-answering, and sentiment analysis, showcasing their ability to capture complex linguistic patterns, generate coherent text, and provide accurate sentiment analysis, but also highlighting the need for more research on their limitations, biases, and potential applications in sentiment analysis. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in both public and proprietary LLMs (Qin et al., 2024) (Zhu et al., 2023), which has the potential to revolutionize sentiment analysis by enabling the analysis of sentiment in multiple languages, and providing valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors across different languages and cultures. Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, the capability of cross-lingual transfer in these LLMs has not been fully studied for sentiment analysis tasks, and it is still unclear how LLMs stand in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models in the cross-lingual transfer paradigm, which highlights the need for further research in this area to fully leverage the potential of LLMs in sentiment analysis. In this work, we examine a variety of pre-trained models and conduct a comprehensive study on the cross-lingual transfer capability in utterance-level sentiment analysis tasks with human speech transcript, using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques to evaluate the performance of the models, and providing valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each model. We classify our candidate public pre-trained models into two categories: Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLM) such as XLM-R and mT5, and more recent Large Language Models (LLM) primarily focused on English such as Llama-3 (2024) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), which have different characteristics and potential applications, with SMLMs being more suitable for low-resource languages and LLMs being more suitable for high-resource languages. In addition, we also include benchmarking with proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), which is widely considered as the best LLM in terms of general capability, but may also exhibit biases, cultural differences, and domain-specific knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in sentiment analysis. To avoid potential data contamination introduced in the pre-training process of recent LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023), we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets from in-house human conversation transcripts, and assess cross-lingual sentiment analysis from English to three target languages: Spanish, French, and Chinese, aiming to provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding of sentiment in different languages and cultures. Our evaluation results show that with the same supervised fine-tuning, SMLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capability even with much fewer model parameters, highlighting their potential for efficient and accurate sentiment analysis in low-resource languages, but also highlighting the need for more research on the limitations and potential biases of SMLMs. However, public LLMs exhibit rapid improvement in few-shot cross-lingual transfer scenarios and can surpass the performance of SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are provided, suggesting that LLMs may be more effective in certain scenarios, but also raising concerns about their potential biases, cultural differences, and domain-specific knowledge gaps.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Sentiment analysis has received considerable attention over the years in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its profound value in both academic research and industry applications, particularly in applications such as opinion mining, customer feedback analysis, and market trend prediction, which can provide valuable insights for businesses to make informed decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and stay ahead of the competition, allowing them to respond promptly to changes in market trends and consumer preferences, ultimately leading to increased revenue and competitiveness, as it enables companies to understand their customers' attitudes, preferences, and needs, which can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer service improvements, and ultimately drive business growth. Traditionally, studies in sentiment analysis had been mostly focused on high-resource languages such as English due to a significant deficit of annotated data in other low-resource languages, making it challenging to develop effective sentiment analysis models for languages with limited resources, which has hindered their widespread adoption and usability, particularly in regions where these languages are predominantly spoken, thereby limiting the potential benefits of sentiment analysis in these regions, as it restricts the ability of businesses to understand customer opinions and sentiments in these languages, which can lead to missed opportunities and poor decision-making. Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) and BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022), which have been designed to leverage the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from multiple languages, enabling zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from one language to another without the need for extensive language-specific training data. Such multilingual pre-trained language models exploit the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from a mixture of many languages, facilitating zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from a source to a target language on different downstream NLP tasks, albeit with varying performance outcomes, as they can transfer knowledge from one language to another without the need for explicit training data, and with the ability to adapt to new languages and domains, thereby reducing the need for extensive language-specific training data, which is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages where annotated data is scarce, allowing for more efficient development and deployment of sentiment analysis models in these languages.

(Zhang et al., 2023) shows the strong capability of LLMs with few-shot in-context learning in public English sentiment analysis tasks, where they can achieve high accuracy with minimal training data, and outperform traditional machine learning models that require large amounts of labeled data, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis in customer feedback, product reviews, and social media posts. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in both public and proprietary LLMs (Qin et al., 2024) (Zhu et al., 2023), as they can process and understand multiple languages, and have the ability to adapt to new languages and domains, which is a promising area of research in NLP, enabling the development of more versatile and effective language models that can handle a wide range of languages and tasks.

Many insist on defining it by measurable qualities like salary and ranking, but there are many ways to define success based on your goals. What makes it difficult to precisely define career success is the numerous factors at play. Your relationship with co-workers, reputation in your field, salary, benefits, and more all influence your sense of success.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed by these factors is common. To avoid stress, view your career success in a personal manner. Do you feel fulfilled by your job? Are you happy going to work in the mornings? Much of success is beyond your control. Accept that there are various definitions of success, and what ultimately matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment.\n\nIf you're looking to define success, start by defining your priorities and passions. Whether your career helps you fulfill your passions is a major determining factor in whether you feel successful. Think about when you were younger. What did you want to be when you grew up as a child? What were your goals in college? Are you using your degree? Why or why not?\n\nOftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose track of their true passions and interests. Conversely, people who feel stressed over their career feel successful when they realize their work truly reflects their passion. Don't fear change. Defining one's passions can help with a personal definition of success.\n\nAcknowledging what you're doing in the present moment may not meet your standards is scary. However, it can also be an opportunity to grow. If you always wanted to be a teacher but work in marketing, consider returning to school for a teaching degree. In some states, community colleges allow you to teach with just an undergraduate education.\n\nWhat is really important to you? Do you crave prestige and honor? Or are you more idealistically oriented? Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you? There is no wrong way to crave success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you can help you define success.\n\nIt's essential to avoid outside definitions of success. Research shows the happiest, most fulfilled people across all careers are those who define success based on personal goals, passions, and desires. Try writing down your definition of success and placing it somewhere you can see each day.\n\nReminding yourself of your goals can help you on your way to success. Your definition of success should be somewhat vague, as much of success is beyond your control. Keep it all encompassing, like \"I want to feel fulfilled in my work every day and do a job that's intellectually stimulating for me.\"\n\nMany people view success as a series of goals. You get your degree, then a job, then a promotion, and so on. However, this approach can lead to feeling hollow and disappointed once you've reached a goal. Instead, view your life as a continuous journey where you try to do a bit better each day. This will keep you stimulated and emotionally and intellectually active long-term.\n\nUltimately, your definition of success should reflect your priorities, passions, and goals.

Cortisone will help fight inflammation and reduce the surrounding redness of the scar, making it less noticeable. You can purchase cortisone cream without a prescription at most pharmacies. It should cost around $10. Look for creams labeled as \"non-comedogenic,\" which means they avoid clogging pores with ingredients like cocoa butter, coal tar, isopropyl myristate, and pigments and dyes. Fighting acne while trying to treat scars is a losing battle. Fade creams are another tool to consider. Fade creams containing kojic acid or arbutin will help lighten the blemished skin, reducing its visibility. You can find these creams at your local pharmacy for a relatively low cost. However, be cautious of hydroquinone, as it may have cancer-causing properties.\n\nHydroquinone is a skin fading topical that lightens skin pigments, but it has fallen out of favor due to safety concerns. Retinoids are topical or oral products that normalize hyperkeratinisation, preventing skin cells from clogging pores and causing acne. They also have anti-inflammatory qualities and promote healing, improving the look of the skin. Topical retinoids like Retin-A or Tazorac are used to treat acne and scarring. Chemical peels, which include alpha-hydroxy acids and Beta-hydroxy acids, remove the top layer of dead skin, revealing newer, less blemished skin underneath.\n\nYou can usually buy retinoids in a cream or serum without a prescription. However, pregnant women should avoid them as they are not safe for the fetus. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, may be an effective way to fade or remove acne scars. It can be found in simple ingredients like lemon juice. Vitamin C contains antioxidants, reduces inflammation, and is essential in the production of collagen, which the body uses to heal connective tissue. You can buy specially formulated vitamin C skin creams or serums at drugstores and pharmacies.\n\nA simpler method is to apply lemon juice to your face with a cotton swab, leaving it for no longer than 30 minutes after thorough cleansing. You may experience some stinging or discomfort, and your skin may dry out, so apply moisturizer afterward. Another variation of this home remedy is to mix lemon juice with honey and milk in a proportion of 1:2:3 and apply it as a mask after cleansing. Remove the mask after no more than 30 minutes. Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight while using lemon juice to lighten your skin, as it can cause further damage to acne scars. Like many topical treatments, results may not be immediate, but regular safe use can help prevent and treat acne.\n\nCreams with vitamin E may actually do more harm than good.

Controllable language generation attempts to model p(X|a) where a is a desired attribute (e.g., topic, length, and sentiment): p(X|a) = T (cid:89) i=1 p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a). (2) To simplify the expression, we use X1:i to denote the sequence {x1, x2, ..., xi}. Earlier works directly model p(X|a) by maximizing the likelihood of the task-specific corpus, known as Class Conditional Language Models (CCLMs) [39; 12; 15]. However, CCLMs usually suffer from corpus overfitting. Bayesian Controllable Language Models (BCLMs) [5; 18; 36] are proposed to solve the corpus overfitting problem. They attempt to find a generation path of the pre-trained language model that matches the target attribute. BCLMs use a discriminator to model the class probability p(a|X1:i) and then sample the desired output from p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) according to the Bayes Rule: p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) \u221d p(a|X1:i)p(xi|X1:i\u22121). (3) With the Bayes Rule, BCLMs convert the controllable language generation task to a combination of an unconditional language generation task and a classification task. Since p(xi|X1:i\u22121) can be given by an off-the-shelf PLM (in this paper, we use the GPT2 model), BCLMs only need to model p(a|X1:i). BCLMs usually train the discriminator with the sentences from the task-specific corpus to model p(a|X1:i). However, in inference, the discriminator receives text generated by GPT2 as input, which is different from the training corpus. The mismatch between training and inference limits the performance of BCLMs. In this work, we propose using GPT2 to extract the features of the sentences from the task-specific corpus and using the features as input to the discriminator. Since GPT2 has been pre-trained on general-purpose corpora, it is reasonable to assume that it has \"seen\" similar sentences from the task-specific corpus. This mitigates the mismatch problem in BCLMs. However, this job is challenging. In Equation (3), xi is to be generated at step i in inference. To get the probability distribution of xi, we need to calculate p(a|X1:i\u22121, w) for all tokens w in the vocabulary. It is a huge cost for extracting the features of sentence {X1:i\u22121, w} for all tokens w in the vocabulary. To address the efficiency problem, we introduce the \"Gemini Discriminator\" (Gemini) for controllable language generation. The Gemini uses the features extracted by GPT2 as input in training and has a small computational cost in inference. To improve the performance of Gemini, we adopt knowledge distillation [9; 17] in training. Moreover, inspired by nucleus sampling [11] and the decoding strategy in GeDi [18], we design an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method in generation, which considers both fluency and attribute relevance in generation. We experimented on two controllable language generation tasks: sentiment control and topic control. On both tasks, Gemini achieved new state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations. 17. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of Gemini in controllable language generation.", "scores": {"ppl": 54.40683364868164, "some": 0.8731212615966797, "bart": -0.9019931554794312, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}

In the form of Video Assistant Referees (VAR), Artificial Intelligence has already been successfully implemented in various sports, including football (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2021) and tennis ATP (ATP Tour, Inc., 2023). Notably, the ATP has announced that electronic line calling (ELC) will be applied to all ATP tournaments by 2025 (ATP, 2023), indicating a clear trend towards automation of tennis officiating. Spitz et al. (2021) have shown that the use of VAR has significantly increased the likelihood of making correct decisions in football matches. Tamir and Bar-Eli (2020) pointed out that the VAR system has promoted fairness and more accurate decisions, bringing about significant ethical transformations in the football world. Meanwhile, athletes are achieving enhanced physical conditions (Guest et al., 2019; Bonilla et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Haugen et al., 2019) and notably faster speeds (Xia et al., 2023) with the progress of nutritional science and systematic training, which has significantly increased the complexity and difficulty of the tasks of human referees. This calls for the development of robust, real-time decision-making assistive tools. Language models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Language Models (VLMs), have offered promising solutions by processing complex contextual data of textual and visual modalities from sports events to assist in impartial decision-making. Our research focuses on the Sports Understanding ability of LLMs and VLMs, an underexplored area yet crucial for their potential applications in automated refereeing and related domains. To assess the sports understanding capabilities of LLMs and VLMs, we introduced a new benchmark dubbed as Sport Intelligence.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Speech translators for safety-critical applications, such as medicine, require high-precision translations. One way to achieve high precision is to limit the translator's coverage to a specific domain by using a domain-specific translator; for instance, in the field of medicine, this is achieved by developing such high-precision, domain-specific translators, which can be resource-intensive and require rare combinations of developer skills. Developing such a system for the orthopedic domain, for example, would require an expert with expertise in both orthopedics and programming, as well as proficiency in Russian and Swahili, which could be an individual with a rare combination of skills: an orthopedist who is also a programmer and linguist proficient in Russian and Swahili. Furthermore, developing translators for all pairs of languages requires O(N^2) systems, which would need an equal number of bilingual domain experts to develop, as each pair of languages would require a separate system; however, the language pair explosion and the need for developers to possess knowledge about both the source and target languages can be addressed by adopting an interlingua-based approach. The requirement that developers be both domain experts and linguists can be addressed by using grammar libraries, which implement the domain-independent linguistic details of each language, and provide functions that grammar writers can use when defining the concrete syntax of an application's grammar; GF is a type-theoretic grammar formalism, introduced by Ranta (2004), that is well-suited for high-precision domain-specific interlingua-based translation. GF divides grammars into abstract syntax and concrete syntax, which respectively define what can be said and how it is said in a particular language; when an abstract syntax is paired with multiple concrete syntaxes, the abstract syntax can serve as an interlingua. Given an abstract syntax and a concrete syntax, GF enables both parsing (text to abstract syntax) and linearization (abstract syntax to text); this enables interlingua-based translation by parsing in one language and linearizing to another using GF; the GF Resource Grammar Library implements the domain-independent morphological and syntactic details of eleven languages, offering a set of functions for grammar writers to use when defining the concrete syntax of an application's grammar. The GF speech recognition grammar compiler can generate context-free grammars or finite-state models for guiding speech recognizers; these models can then be combined with other components to develop domain-specific speech translators based on GF grammars; however, the GF speech recognition grammar compiler can generate context-free grammars or finite-state models for guiding speech recognizers, which can then be used in a minimal unidirectional speech translator, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1, which utilizes GF components as a proof-of-concept system demonstrating how GF components can be used for speech translation; however, comparing this system to a more complete and mature system like MedSLT (Bouillon et al., 2005) is challenging.

The task of headline generation involves automatically generating informative, engaging, and captivating headlines that accurately capture the essence of the underlying text. Headline generation is a challenging task due to two major factors: firstly, headlines must accurately represent the content of the text while being concise and concise enough to fit within a limited character count. This requires a fine balance between capturing the key information and maintaining brevity, a delicate act that demands careful attention to detail. Secondly, headlines often need to be attention-grabbing, compelling readers to click and read further by using persuasive language, creativity, and an understanding of rhetorical devices, all of which are essential for effective headline generation. In recent years, the NLP community has achieved remarkable strides in the development of headline-generation models, a significant breakthrough that has opened up new avenues for research and development. However, the focus has primarily been on English and other widely spoken languages, inadvertently leaving a significant void in the realm of headline generation for Indian languages, a lacuna that needs to be addressed urgently. While datasets like Gigaword have emerged as prominent resources, comprising an impressive collection of over 4 million news article-headline pairs, it is crucial to acknowledge that they are limited to English and fail to capture the intricacies and linguistic nuances of Indian languages, a glaring omission that highlights the need for more diverse and inclusive datasets. India, with its rich linguistic diversity, boasts a staggering array of over 22 officially recognized languages, each with its own distinct grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, a characteristic that presents both opportunities and challenges for headline generation. Addressing the challenge of headline generation in Indian languages necessitates a deep understanding of the specific linguistic and cultural intricacies inherent in each language, a nuanced approach that requires careful consideration of the unique characteristics of each language. One of the most significant obstacles hindering headline generation in Indian languages is the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, a critical limitation that severely limits the effectiveness of model training and impedes the performance of supervised learning approaches, which heavily rely on labeled examples, a reality that underscores the need for more diverse and inclusive datasets. Fortunately, recent advancements in neural network architectures, such as transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced the performance of headline generation models, a breakthrough that has opened up new avenues for research and development. These models possess the ability to encode input text and generate headlines by optimizing various objectives, including semantic coherence, informativeness, and readability, a multifaceted approach that demands careful attention to detail. While these models have successfully reduced the dependency on labeled data, they still leverage fine-tuning on specialized headline generation datasets to further enhance their performance, a reality that highlights the need for more diverse and inclusive datasets. In the context of Bengali language, Salehin et al. (2019); Amin et al. (2021) conducted data collection from various news websites using web scraping techniques, a significant contribution that has helped to advance research in headline generation. They proposed an RNN-based encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism for headline generation, a notable achievement that has shed light on the potential of neural network architectures in headline generation. Another notable resource for multilingual abstractive summarization, XL-Sum, was introduced by Hasan et al. (2021). The Indian language section of the XLSum dataset consists of 251K article-headline pairs sourced from BBC2, a significant contribution that has helped to advance research in headline generation. To further advance research in Natural Language Generation (NLG) for Indian languages, Kumar et al. (2022) proposed the IndicNLG benchmark, encompassing five different NLG tasks, including a headline generation dataset (hereafter referred to as IndicHG dataset). However, our analysis (detailed in Section 4) reveals serious quality issues, such as data contamination, rendering it unsuitable for training robust models, a reality that underscores the need for more diverse and inclusive datasets. Despite its claimed size, the dataset\u2019s problematic samples significantly reduce its effective size by nearly half.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: 1. We present a large, multilingual headline-generation dataset \"Mukhyansh\", comprising over 3.39 million news article-headline pairs across 8 Indian languages; namely Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "In recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants. Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has been the gauge of Machine Translation system evaluation. Nevertheless, the research community has been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU metric. BLEU captures only a single dimension of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate translation gets acknowledged only if it uses exactly the same lexicon as the reference translation. Natural languages, however, are characterized by their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction via a large number of syntactic, lexical and semantic rewriting rules. Although BLEU has been shown to correlate positively with human assessments at the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to improve state-of-the-art MT require that human assessment be approximated at sentence level as well. Researchers report the BLEU score at document level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams in BLEU scoring. But, ultimately, document-level MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the granularity of the sentence. Unfortunately, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005, 2006). While acknowledging the appealing simplicity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an MT candidate translation\u2019s quality, we observe the following facts of n-gram based MT metrics. First, they may not reflect the mechanism of how human beings evaluate sentence translation quality. More specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee the optimization of sentence quality approved by human assessors. Therefore, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessment at sentence level for most candidate translations. Second, it is conceivable that human beings are more reliable ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than assigning a numeric value to index the quality of the candidate translation even with significant deliberation. Consequently, a more intuitive approach for automatic MT evaluation is to replicate the quality ranking ability of human assessors. Thirdly, the BLEU score is elusive and hard to interpret; for example, what can be concluded for a candidate translation\u2019s quality if the BLEU score is 0.0168, particularly when we are aware that even a human translation can receive an embarrassingly low BLEU score? In light of the discussion above, we propose an alternative scenario for MT evaluation, where, instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation under evaluation, we predict its rank with regard to its peer candidate translations. This formulation of the MT evaluation task fills the gap between an automatic scoring function and human MT evaluation practice. The results from the current study will not only interest MT system evaluation moderators but will also inform the research community about which features are useful in improving the correlation between human rankings and automatic rankings.", "scores": {"ppl": 76.5727767944336, "some": 0.8187522649765017, "bart": -0.2414414294064045, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's a refined version of the text with more than 700 tokens and fewer than 32 sentences, with each sentence containing fewer than 35 tokens:\n\nInnovation in modern systems arises from the interaction of software, electrical, and mechanical components, resulting in complex functionalities. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs), autonomous vehicles, and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have emerged from this ongoing trend, driven by the need for collaboration among experts from diverse domains. The engineering of these systems-of-systems poses significant challenges, including the need for cooperation among experts with different backgrounds and areas of expertise. One of the key challenges is the rising number of requirements that address stakeholders from heterogeneous domains, making it essential to develop tools that can capture, analyze, and process requirements systematically. In systems engineering, particularly in the automotive domain, requirements are captured as documents containing text mainly in natural language, often with additional information provided through pictures or Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models.\n\nExperts interpret these textual requirements to enter the design phase, deriving details of the implementation directly from them. However, the ambiguity of natural language, particularly when interpreted by experts from different backgrounds, may result in decreasing product quality, system failures detected at late development stages, and hinder the implementation of functional safety standards, such as ISO 26262. The document-based approach to requirements engineering prevents agile development, where automated analyses and syntheses should enable early error detection and fast feedback for developers. What is needed are tools that can facilitate the capture, analysis, and processing of requirements systematically during all phases of the development cycle.\n\nAn approach to achieve this is Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), which utilizes models as the primary development artifacts. These models serve as documentation and communication basis for engineers, input for analyses and syntheses, such as verification, test case generation, or code generation. For instance, MDE can be applied to facilitate the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems, which are increasingly being used in the automotive domain. Approaches to introduce MDE in the automotive requirements engineering exist, but introducing MDE comes with initial costs and efforts for training domain experts in modeling and translating many documents to models.\n\nAn advantage of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) rather than general-purpose modeling languages, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), is that their syntax and semantics can be designed to be intuitive for model users. Requirements captured in natural language can be formulated in a textual DSL that offers sentence structures and wording close to the current formulation, increasing intuitiveness of both usage and understanding of models in this DSL significantly. However, in addition to the DSL development costs and the DSL training, the translation of old, unstructured requirements to models in the DSL can be a significant effort due to the high number of requirements, requiring time and modeling know-how from the translating developer.\n\nIn this paper, we analyze an open-source set of automotive requirements for ADAS and Adaptive Light System (ALS) to understand where formulation inaccuracies occur and how targeted DSL constructs can help eliminate these inaccuracies and increase the level of formality and consistency in these requirements. Our goal and main contribution is the application and evaluation of few-shot learning of large neural natural language models for the translation of given unstructured requirements to sentences incorporating the new formal DSL constructs. Such translation models can be used 1) during the introduction phase of a DSL to automatically translate existing or legacy natural language requirements into the new DSL syntax and 2) to correct natural language inputs in a smart editor when a requirement engineer writes a new requirement as natural text.\n\nWith this automation supported by the fact that few-shot learning requires only a handful of translation examples to learn a given translation task, our aim is to facilitate the introduction of highly specialized requirement DSLs, targeting a single department of a company using specific wording or even a single project. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the technical foundations of our approach, Section 3 highlights the challenges and potentials of an MDE approach for requirements engineering within engineering domains driven by natural-language text-based documents, and Section 4 outlines related work in this area.\n\nSection 5 presents an example DSL for capturing requirements in the automotive domain, and Section 6 details the automatic translation from natural-language to the DSL.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "The phrase-based approach has been widely regarded as the default strategy in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) over recent years, and it remains the standard approach in the field, which is widely accepted in the research community. It is well-known that the phrase-based approach is particularly powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within a short distance, and consequently, this capacity enables the model to achieve impressive results in this area. However, long-distance reordering poses a significant problem in phrase-based SMT, which can lead to suboptimal translation results and necessitates an alternative strategy that addresses this issue effectively. For example, the distance-based reordering model, introduced by Koehn et al. in 2003, allows a decoder to translate in a non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as the distortion limit. This model was proposed by Koehn et al. in 2003 to address the challenges of long-distance reordering in SMT. However, the model has some limitations that need to be addressed. This model can be seen as a solution to the limitations of the phrase-based approach, which effectively addresses its inability to handle long-distance reordering, and it has been widely adopted in recent years, providing improved performance in this area. In theory, the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value, allowing all possible reorderings, but this approach comes with significant drawbacks and challenges that need to be carefully considered. However, assigning too high a distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance, as observed by Koehn et al. in 2005, and it is essential to find the optimal balance between the two factors. In our experiment setting, the optimal distortion limit for Chinese-English translation is 2, which provides a good balance between efficiency and translation quality, and it has been widely adopted in practice, demonstrating its effectiveness. However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings that exceed this distortion limit, rendering it ineffective in certain cases and highlighting its limitations, which need to be addressed in future research. Considerations of syntax are crucial in understanding the complexities of language translation, and developing a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the subtleties of human language and its intricacies is essential for achieving improved performance. The sentence pair in the NIST MT2005 test set presents a challenge to the distance-based model, which is not equipped to handle long-distance reordering, and this challenge is a significant one that needs to be addressed. This renders the distance-based model useless in certain cases, where the distortion limit is exceeded, and a more effective approach is needed to overcome this limitation and rectify the issue, which has significant implications for SMT research. Therefore, while short-distance reordering is within the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question, and a more effective approach is needed to address this challenge, which has been a long-standing issue in the field. A terminological remark is necessary to avoid confusion in the terminology used throughout the paper and to ensure clarity, which is essential for effective communication. The distinction between global and local reordering is solely defined by the distortion limit, which is a crucial factor in determining the scope of the reordering process, and it is essential to understand this distinction and its implications, which have significant implications for SMT research. Syntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering, but it is not the only factor at play, and other considerations must be taken into account in developing a comprehensive translation model, requiring careful consideration of the complexities of human language. However, not all reorderings can be explained by syntax alone, and other factors, such as semantics and pragmatics, also play a significant role in determining the optimal translation, which is a complex and multifaceted issue. However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on syntax, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to effectively handle global reordering and address this challenge, which has significant implications for SMT research. These cases highlight the limitations of relying solely on syntax, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to effectively handle global reordering, which is a critical issue in SMT research. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder achieves a good English translation by reordering two blocks effectively, and this approach has been widely adopted in recent years, providing improved performance in this area. It should be noted that the second Chinese block \u201c\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u201d and its English counterpart \u201cat the end of\u201d are not constituents at all, and their reordering is not driven by syntax alone, highlighting the complexities of language translation, which is a multifaceted issue. In this paper, our primary focus is on the role of syntax in reordering, and our main contribution is the finding that syntactic information is valuable in handling global reordering, leading to improved performance compared to the standard phrase-based model, which is a significant contribution to the field. To substantiate this claim, we developed a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of phrase-based SMT in local reordering with syntax-based global reordering, providing a more effective solution to the challenge of reordering, which has significant implications for SMT research. Our approach is based on previous preprocessing methods, such as those of Xia and McCord (2004), Collins et al. (2005), and Costa-jussa and Fonollos\u00e0 (2006), which split the translation process into two stages, providing a more efficient approach to translation. The second stage involves translating the reordered sentence into a target language sentence, which is a crucial step in the overall translation process, requiring careful consideration of the complexities of human language, which is a multifaceted issue. This change is essential to accommodate the reordering process, enabling the decoder to produce a more accurate translation, and it has been widely adopted in practice, demonstrating its effectiveness in this area. Our second contribution is a new definition of the best translation, as represented by formula X, where Fi are the features from the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S \u2192 S') is our novel feature, which calculates the probability of reordering S as S', providing a more accurate measure of translation quality. The details of this model are provided in sections 3-6, where its implementation and evaluation are discussed in detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the approach, which has significant implications for SMT research. The experimental settings and results are presented in detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the approach, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach, which has significant implications for SMT research.", "scores": {"ppl": 34.708824157714844, "some": 0.8726889292399088, "bart": -2.6912755966186523, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Pre-trained language models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020b), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), have consistently demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. Notably, their multilingual versions have exhibited impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual settings (Pires et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019). In these scenarios, multilingual PLMs are fine-tuned on English data, often with limited or even without data from other languages, yet they acquire the proficiency to handle tasks in different languages (9th sentence remains unchanged). However, the construction of multilingual PLMs typically involves stacked transformer layers or their variants, employing self-attention mechanisms to capture diverse and distant dependencies among tokens. This use of self-attention introduces significant computational complexity, resulting in substantial inference complexity for multilingual PLMs. Consequently, the inference complexity of multilingual PLMs has become a significant bottleneck, limiting their deployment on devices sensitive to latency and constrained by computational resources. To address these stringent requirements for efficient inference in applications, various methods have been proposed to accelerate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) inference. These methods include model compression (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020, 2019), early exiting (Xin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021), and model cascading (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). Among these, model cascading methods are particularly appealing for several reasons, including 1) their independence from specific hardware support, such as custom chips and GPUs, and 2) their elimination of the need to train an inference-efficient model from scratch on the pre-training corpora. Model cascading methods involve the aggregation of multiple PLMs with different sizes, with confidence scores computed sequentially from small to large size models to determine the appropriate model to employ. Once a confidence score surpasses a threshold, the corresponding model is selected, and the inference process ends. Despite their advantages, cascade-based models exhibit notable limitations in cross-lingual scenarios, particularly when confidence scores are determined by the maximum output of models trained on English data to be applicable to other languages (16th sentence remains unchanged). Specifically, we introduce a plugin calibration step at the base of mPLMs to address this issue. Initially, we normalize the logits to alleviate over-confidence during model fine-tuning. Subsequently, we implement a temperature scaling step to adjust the logits with a learnable scalar parameter. The proposed framework calibrates each individual model in the cascade, providing more reliable confidence scores. This, in turn, enhances the model\u2019s performance and generalization capabilities, leading to consistent improvements in efficiency and accuracy across different languages. Importantly, the proposed framework only requires an extra calibration module at the base of mPLMs, preserving the original architectures of mPLMs. Hence, it demonstrates flexibility to accommodate the latest models with minimal additional training overhead. We introduce a flexible and effective framework, C3, for enhancing efficiency in cross-lingual inference, which is the primary contribution of this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dedicated to the design of inference-efficient models specifically tailored for cross-lingual scenarios. We introduce a plug-in calibration module to address the notable overconfidence phenomenon in both encoder-only PLMs and decoder-only PLMs in cross-lingual scenarios. Extensive experiments on five cross-lingual benchmarks indicate that the proposed C3 outperforms baselines significantly and achieves a good efficiency-accuracy trade-off. For instance, it preserves 98.10% of BERT\u2019s performance and 95.28% of Llama-2\u2019s performance on classification tasks and an average of 74.3% performance on generation tasks, all while reducing computation costs by half.", "scores": {"ppl": 60.45326232910156, "some": 0.8802711168924967, "bart": -0.7949233651161194, "acc": 0.0}}}

For developers and researchers, it offers insights into unintended biases and areas of improvement, serving as a tool for improving the performance of the model in downstream tasks (Bastings et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b). However, the scale of neural networks poses unique challenges to explainability, particularly given recent work by Zhao et al. (2023), Bastings et al. (2022), Meng et al. (2023a), and Li et al. (2023b), highlighting the need for innovative solutions to address these challenges, which needs to be addressed to advance the field. Larger models with more parameters and extensive training data are harder to interpret; traditional explanation methods, such as SHAP values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017), have become less practical for these large-scale models, as highlighted by Zhao et al. (2023). In this survey, we focus on explainability methods for pre-trained, Transformer-based neural networks, known as base models, which are widely used for their scalability and performance, that are essential for real-world applications, where they can be used to improve the performance of AI systems. These models often scale up in training data, with billions of parameters, as exemplified by models such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-J (Chen et al., 2021), and the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023), which are increasingly used in various NLP tasks, including natural language processing and other applications. In Section 2, we provide a structured framework for understanding the current state of explainability research, categorizing and posing research questions based on our survey, which aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area. Based on this framework, we review explainability methods in Section 3, and discuss their application and implications in Section 4, highlighting the importance of rigorous assessment in the field of explainability. We further discuss the evaluation methods and metrics in Section 5, emphasizing the importance of rigorous assessment in the field of explainability, which is crucial for advancing research in this area. Our goal is to synthesize and critically assess contemporary research, bridging the gap between understanding and practical application of insights from complex language models, and provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of explainability research, aiming to advance the field of explainability.", "scores": {"ppl": 33.260616302490234, "some": 0.8844647407531738, "bart": -1.7756612300872803, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Compared to other garden plants, avocado plants may require lots of water. However, over-watering is a potential problem for nearly all plants, including avocados. Avoid watering so frequently that the avocado tree's soil looks liquid or muddy. Use a soil with good drainage, rich in organic matter. Potted trees need drainage holes in the bottom to allow water to escape. Follow these simple tips to prevent over-watering. If your plant's leaves start turning yellow and you've been watering frequently, this may be a sign of over-watering. Immediately stop watering and wait until the soil is dry. You may not need fertilizer to grow a strong, healthy avocado tree. However, fertilizers can noticeably boost a young plant's growth when used sensibly. Once the tree is established, add balanced citrus fertilizer to the soil during the growing season, following the package directions. Don't overdo it \u2013 commercial fertilizers are best used in moderation. Always water after fertilizing to ensure the fertilizer is absorbed. Avocados should not be fertilized when they're very young, as they can be susceptible to overusing fertilizer. Wait at least a year before fertilizing. Avocados can be especially vulnerable to salt buildup in the soil. Avocado plants with high salt levels may have wilted leaves with brown tips where excess salt is accumulating. To lower soil salinity, change your watering practices. At least once a month, water heavily, soaking the soil. This heavy water flow carries built-up salts deep into the soil, below the roots. Potted plants are especially susceptible to salt buildup. Once a month, place the pot in a sink or outside, then let water flow completely through and drain out the bottom. Avocado plants can suffer from various pests and diseases that may threaten the fruit or endanger the entire plant. Knowing how to recognize and solve these issues is crucial to maintaining a healthy, productive avocado tree. Below are just a few of the most common avocado pests and illnesses: Cankers \u2014 \"Rusty\", sunken sores on the plant that may ooze gum. Cut cankers from affected branches. Cankers on the trunk may kill the plant. Root rot \u2014 Usually caused by over-watering. Causes yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual decay. Immediately stop over-watering and, if severe, dig up the roots to expose them to air. Wilts and Blights \u2014 \"Dead\" patches on the tree. Fruits and leaves within these patches wither and die. Remove the affected areas immediately and wash your tools before using them again. Lace bugs cause yellow spots on leaves that quickly dry out.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Draw your intricate pattern on a large piece of high-quality graph paper that accurately represents the size you need to work with in order to ensure precise measurements and guarantee a successful final project. Cut the pattern into its individual components, and label each piece by color and grain direction for precision, easy identification, and a comprehensive understanding of each part to ensure a seamless workflow. Place the pattern under the glass and carefully trace the outline with a thin, permanent marker to ensure accuracy, prevent mistakes, and achieve a precise cut that meets your expectations. Leave a small margin of space, typically one centimeter or less, between the pieces for the thickness of the copper foil to ensure a smooth fit, prevent potential problems, and achieve a professional finish that you can be proud of. Use a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass surface clearly and distinctly for better visibility, to avoid any confusion, and to guarantee a high-quality product that meets your requirements. If you have access to a lightbox, this can be incredibly helpful for accurately tracing the pattern onto the glass surface for precise results, to save time, and to achieve a professional finish that is consistent throughout. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger, with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger, positioning your hand for a stable and secure grip that will prevent accidents and injuries from occurring. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to ensure a straight and even cut every time, maintain precision, and achieve the desired results that meet your expectations. Begin at a point away from your body and start scraping inward, applying gentle pressure to the glass to achieve a smooth score line, prevent any chips or cracks, and to ensure a professional finish that you can be proud of. Make sure you are applying the correct amount of pressure to the glass cutter to achieve a smooth score line, which is essential for a clean break, to avoid any difficulties, and to guarantee a high-quality product that meets your requirements. You should hear a distinct, clear 'zzzzip' sound as you score the glass successfully, indicating a precise cut, a well-executed process, and a high-quality product that you can be proud of. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line as it should, resulting in an uneven cut that can be difficult to work with, may require additional time and effort, and can lead to frustration and disappointment that can be avoided with practice. Too much pressure will cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter, as well as your wrist and elbow, leading to discomfort, potential injury, and a range of other problems that can be avoided with careful attention to detail and technique. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to maintain proper form and alignment, ensuring a precise fit, a smooth finish, and a professional-looking final product that you can be proud of. Make sure that the score line spans the entire edge of the glass for a clean break, a smooth finish, and a professional-looking final product, which can be a major challenge if not done correctly and requires patience and practice. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size, shape, and curve of the glass you are working with, and each method has its own unique challenges and requirements that must be carefully considered and taken into account. The primary goal is to cut the glass along the scored lines, allowing it to break apart easily, yielding the necessary shapes for your project, and achieving a high-quality final product that meets your expectations and requirements. For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze gently to separate the piece cleanly, using gentle pressure to avoid chipping the glass, to achieve a smooth finish, and to guarantee a professional-looking final product that you can be proud of. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart carefully, avoiding excessive pressure, which can cause the glass to shatter or chip, may require additional time and effort to repair, and can lead to frustration and disappointment. For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring carefully and smoothly, applying gentle pressure to avoid chipping the glass, to maintain a smooth, even curve, and to achieve a high-quality final product that meets your requirements. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if necessary, as long as your curves remain gentle and smooth, which is essential for a professional finish, a high-quality product, and a range of other benefits that you can enjoy. If you're dealing with deep curves, break them down into a series of shallow curves so that they won't break on their own unexpectedly, which can be a common problem when working with curved glass, can be time-consuming to fix, and can lead to frustration and disappointment. Once you've completed cutting, place the pieces along the pattern again and grind down the glass into corrective lines, ensuring a precise fit, a smooth finish, and a professional-looking final product that you can be proud of. Regular sandpaper can also be used to remove sharp edges and smooth out the glass surfaces, which can be a time-consuming process, but is essential for a professional finish, a high-quality product, and a range of other benefits that you can enjoy. Wear protective gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip while handling the glass and sandpaper, which can be a serious injury requiring medical attention, and can have a range of other severe consequences. If you use a glass grinder, you should wear a mask and goggles to prevent glass particles from being breathed in or settling in your eyes, which can cause serious health problems, may require long-term medical treatment, and can have a range of other severe consequences. You will want to grind away gently and patiently, taking your time to avoid chipping any pieces, to achieve the desired results, and to guarantee a high-quality final product that meets your expectations and requirements. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces once you've finished grinding them and fitting them together, providing additional support and stability to the glass, helping to prevent any accidents or injuries, and ensuring a professional-looking final product that you can be proud of. This prevents the pieces from slipping when applying copper foil, making the process easier and more efficient, saving you a lot of time and effort, and improving the overall quality of your project and your overall experience. Cover the edges of the glass with a consistent layer of copper foil that is approximately 7/32 inch in thickness, which can be a precise and challenging process requiring a high degree of skill, attention to detail, and patience to execute correctly. Make sure the foil is centered on the glass edge, otherwise it can look slightly uneven or 'funny' when completed, which can be a major aesthetic problem, may require additional time and effort to correct, and can have a range of other negative consequences that you want to avoid. This can be accomplished by hand or with the use of a specialized table foiler, depending on your personal preference and needs, which can be a time-consuming and challenging process requiring a high degree of skill, attention to detail, and patience to execute correctly.", "scores": {"ppl": 24.80117416381836, "some": 0.8729609648386637, "bart": -2.3686294555664062, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here is the refined text with more than six tokens per sentence, maintaining the use of the word '1' and resulting in more than 34 sentences:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPTs [Achiam et al., 2023, Brown et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2021] have achieved remarkable success in solving a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including question answering [Devlin et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2020b, Raffel et al., 2020]. For example, question answering, machine translation [Raffel et al., 2020, Brown et al., 2020b], text classification [Raffel et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], and text generation [Yang et al., 2019, Achiam et al., 2023] have been notable areas of success for LLMs. However, their performance on complex graph reasoning tasks has been notably inadequate [Zhang, 2023], highlighting a significant gap in their capabilities. Current research highlights that while LLMs can handle basic graph-related queries, they have a challenge with more complex graph structures and multi-step reasoning processes [Liu and Wu, 2023, Wang et al., 2024, Creswell et al., 2022]. Furthermore, their limitations in graph reasoning have been a major focus of research in recent years, with many studies aiming to improve their performance in this area.\n\nTo address the limitations of LLMs in graph reasoning, we propose to use their programming capabilities to enhance reasoning on graphs. Recognizing the potential of leveraging LLMs\u2019 programming capabilities in computational contexts [Yang et al., 2024, Murphy et al., 2024], we introduce GraphEval2000, the first dataset designed to evaluate the graph reasoning capability of LLMs through coding challenges. It includes 40 data structure problems and 2,000 test cases, with each problem including: (1) problem statement, (2) data examples, (3) constraints, and (4) code framework. The dataset has four main graph categories: Sparse, Planar, Regular, and Complete graphs. Within each main category, there are four sub-categories: connected, disconnected, cyclic, and acyclic graphs, each with its unique set of characteristics and challenges.\n\nBased on GraphEval2000, we propose the evaluation framework, which provides real-time feedback to users. The entire framework is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the input problem statement, data examples, and code framework to LLMs, and then they complete the code and give explanations. Finally, the framework evaluates the code on GraphEval2000 and returns the result details, including passing rate, error report, etc. Unlike traditional coding challenges (e.g., LeetCode) that obscure test case details [Hou and Ji, 2024, Hu et al., 2024], the framework will return failed test cases along with execution results.\n\nTo better help readers use our framework to evaluate and improve the performance of LLMs, we propose an instruction-based method, Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD). SSD is designed to enhance LLMs\u2019 ability to understand and solve complex graph problems, by decomposing complex tasks into a \u201ccognitive step\u201d and an \u201caction step\u201d, thereby improving model comprehensions. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive strategies [Paas and van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2020], SSD aims to mimic the way humans approach complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components. Experiments demonstrate that SSD significantly boosts the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o in hard-level graph problems, yielding improvements of 11.11%, 33.37%, and 33.37%, respectively.\n\nWe hope this example inspires the community to further utilize our framework to explore LLMs\u2019 reasoning abilities on graphs, and to push the boundaries of what is possible with these powerful tools.

We hope that this work will inspire the community to further explore the capabilities of LLMs and to push the boundaries of what is possible with these powerful tools.\n\nThe dataset, GraphEval2000, is organized into four primary graph categories, each containing four sub-categories, ensuring a diverse representation of graph structures, and includes a wide range of graph-related problems, from basic to complex.

In recent years, the introduction of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) across various domains, including telecommunications [1, 2]. These advancements have enabled LLMs to condense information characteristics and transform vast knowledge into tokens, which can significantly assist or even substitute human beings in conceptual comprehension, logical thinking, and decision-making. Language models have consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks and exhibited significant algorithmic, reasoning, and analytical skills with minimal or no domain-specific adjustments [3]. This intuitive ability to execute network tasks via natural language interaction has far-reaching implications for the field of telecommunications. Consequently, enhancing or optimizing the performance of networking-specific LLMs emerges as an essential challenge that requires immediate attention. Huang et al. [2] highlighted the potential uses of LLMs in the networking field, emphasizing their ability to transform network design, aid in tasks such as equipment selection and network planning, and contribute significantly to network diagnosis. Furthermore, LLMs can create fault reports and provide processing suggestions using network status data, making them a valuable asset in network management.\n\nMoreover, for network configuration, LLMs could provide a unified natural language interface, simplifying the process and assisting in the management of diverse network devices. LLMs can also interface with various security tools and systems, assisting in security evaluation and intrusion detection. Addressing these specialized issues with the help of LLMs necessitates the application of NLP tasks, such as classification, summarization, question-answering, named entity recognition, relation extraction, etc. However, one major problem is the lack of high-quality datasets in this domain to train these language models, which hinders their effective utilization in telecommunications research.\n\nTo address this problem, Bariah et al. [4] proposed a framework for adapting pre-trained generative models, specifically BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, to the telecom domain. The authors demonstrated the efficiency of these fine-tuned models in classifying 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technical documents into relevant telecom categories and working groups. Another significant contribution to this domain is the proposal of SPEC5G dataset by Karim et al. [5]. This dataset has been successfully applied in tasks like security-related text classification and summarization, aimed at enhancing the understanding and analysis of complex 5G network protocols.\n\nIn addition, Maatouk et al.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Sentiment analysis has received considerable attention over the years in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its profound value in both academic research and industry applications, enabling researchers to better understand public opinions and emotions expressed through text, which can be leveraged to drive business decisions, improve customer experience, and inform policy-making. Traditionally, studies in sentiment analysis had been mostly focused on high-resource languages such as English due to a deficit of annotated data in other low-resource languages, but recent research has emerged to address this issue by leveraging machine translation to augment data resources, thereby reducing the language barrier and expanding the scope of sentiment analysis to a broader range of languages, including low-resource languages like Spanish, French, and Chinese (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020) (Joshi et al., 2020). gpt-3-5-turbo Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), mT5 (Xue et al., 2021), BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022), and other models like Marian (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2020) and ProphetNet (Wang et al., 2020), which have demonstrated impressive performance in cross-lingual transfer and few-shot learning tasks, enabling researchers to explore new avenues for multilingual sentiment analysis. Such multilingual pre-trained language models exploit the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from a mixture of many languages, facilitating zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from a source to a target language on different downstream NLP tasks, albeit with varying performance outcomes, highlighting the need for further research to address the limitations of these models, such as their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and the potential for overfitting to specific languages or domains (Lauscher et al., 2020). More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama-3 (2024) have collected immense attention for their unparalleled performance in text generation, which can be leveraged for sentiment analysis tasks, including the detection of emotional tone, sentiment polarity, and other aspects of text, and have shown the potential for few-shot in-context learning, enabling models to learn from a small number of examples in the target language and generalize to new, unseen texts (GPT-3). (Zhang et al., 2023) shows the strong capability of LLMs with few-shot in-context learning in public English sentiment analysis tasks, demonstrating the potential for these models to outperform traditional machine learning approaches and human annotators in certain tasks, but also highlighting the limitations of these models, such as their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and their potential for bias and overfitting. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in both public and proprietary LLMs, such as the ability to learn and generalize to multiple languages, including low-resource languages, and the potential for these models to be fine-tuned for specific languages or domains, but also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of multilinguality for sentiment analysis (Qin et al., 2024) (Zhu et al., 2023). Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, the capability of cross-lingual transfer in these LLMs has not been fully studied for sentiment analysis tasks, and it is still unclear how LLMs stand in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models in the cross-lingual transfer paradigm, which is critical for building robust and generalizable sentiment analysis systems that can handle the complexities of language and culture. In this work, we examine a variety of pre-trained models and conduct a comprehensive study on the cross-lingual transfer capability in utterance-level sentiment analysis tasks with human speech transcripts, involving a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of different models, including SMLMs and LLMs, and an evaluation of their performance on a range of tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer. We classify our candidate public pre-trained models into two categories: Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLMs) such as XLM-R and mT5, and more recent Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focused on English such as Llama-3 (2024) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), which have demonstrated impressive performance in cross-lingual transfer and few-shot learning tasks, but also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of these models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. In addition, we also include benchmarking with proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), which is widely considered as the best LLM in terms of general capability, but also highlighting the limitations of these models, including their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and the potential for bias and overfitting. To avoid potential data contamination introduced in the pre-training process of recent LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023), we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets from in-house human conversation transcripts, and assess cross-lingual sentiment analysis from English to three target languages: Spanish, French, and Chinese, which requires a detailed understanding of the complexities of language and culture, and the development of robust and generalizable sentiment analysis systems. Our evaluation results show that with the same supervised fine-tuning, SMLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capability even with much fewer model parameters, which is critical for building efficient and scalable sentiment analysis systems that can handle the complexities of language and culture, and also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of these models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. However, public LLMs exhibit rapid improvement in few-shot crosslingual transfer scenarios and can surpass the performance of SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are provided, which highlights the potential for these models to be fine-tuned for specific languages or domains, but also requiring careful consideration of the limitations and biases of these models. Our contributions of this research can be summarized in the following dimensions: (1) the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the cross-lingual transfer capability of pre-trained models in sentiment analysis tasks, (2) the demonstration of the superior performance of SMLMs in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer scenarios, and (3) the identification of the limitations and biases of LLMs and the need for further research to understand their implications for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 27.054046630859375, "some": 0.8924694061279297, "bart": -1.6208211183547974, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's the revised text with improved fluency and within the 520-540 token range.\n\nTo start, you can either purchase sand at a local craft or hardware store, or collect it from a nearby beach.

However, a more nuanced approach to career success may be more beneficial. Part of what makes it difficult to precisely define career success is that numerous factors are at play, including relationships with coworkers, a good reputation in your field, a competitive salary, excellent benefits, and more. These factors can greatly influence an individual's sense of success, and can vary greatly from one person to another. A lot of people feel overwhelmed by the many factors that influence their sense of success, leading to stress and uncertainty about their career path. For instance, someone who values work-life balance may feel pressure to prioritize long working hours over their family life. To avoid feeling stressed about traditional measures of success, try viewing your career success in a personal manner, focusing on what brings you fulfillment and happiness. This may involve exploring your passions, values, and goals, and aligning them with your career objectives. Much of success is unfortunately beyond our control, including factors like family background, upbringing, and random events. For example, someone from a low-income background may face significant barriers to education and career advancement. You need to accept that there are various definitions of success and what truly matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment. By focusing on what brings you joy and satisfaction, you can create a more meaningful and fulfilling career. If you're looking to define success, start by identifying your priorities and passions, and consider how they align with your career goals. For instance, if you're passionate about helping others, you may find success in a non-profit or healthcare field. When considering your career goals, ask yourself: What did you want to be when you grew up? What were your goals in college? Are you currently using your degree, and if not, why not? Breaking down these questions can help you reflect on your values and aspirations. Oftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose sight of their true passions and interests, leading to feelings of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. This can be seen in individuals who are stuck in a job that doesn't align with their values or goals. Conversely, people who feel stressed about their career often feel successful when they realize their work truly reflects their passion and purpose. By aligning their work with their values and goals, individuals can find a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Don't be afraid to change and redefine your career path; sometimes, identifying your passions can help you create a more fulfilling and successful life. For example, someone who always wanted to be a teacher but is currently working in marketing may consider returning to school for a master's in education. If you always wanted to be a teacher but have been working in marketing, you might consider returning to school for a master's in education. This can be a great way to pursue a new career path and align your work with your passions. In some cases, you may be able to teach with just an undergraduate education, such as by attending a community college or obtaining a certification. This can provide a more flexible and affordable path to a teaching career. What matters most to you in a career? Do you crave prestige and honor, or do you prioritize making a difference and helping others? Breaking down these questions can help you reflect on your values and aspirations. Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you, such as by working in a non-profit or healthcare field, or is it the prestige and recognition that drives you? Reflecting on your motivations can help you identify what truly matters to you. There is no one 'right' way to define success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you as an individual can help you define success and create a more fulfilling career. By focusing on what brings you joy and satisfaction, you can create a more meaningful and fulfilling career. It's essential to avoid outside definitions of success, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. For instance, someone who values creativity may feel pressure to conform to traditional standards of success. Research shows that the happiest, most fulfilled people across all careers are those who define success based on personal goals, passions, and desires. By focusing on what truly matters to them, individuals can create a more meaningful and fulfilling career. Try writing down your definition of success and placing it somewhere you can see it each day, such as on a vision board or sticky note. This can help you stay motivated and focused on your path to success.

With the rise of large language models \u2217\u2217Equal contribution. Figure 1: The three types of bilingualism, which are characterized by their unique linguistic features and capabilities, researchers have discovered many emergent properties (Wei et al., 2022a) in these models, and have successfully utilized them for a wide variety of purposes (Wei et al., 2022b). However, the multilingual ability of these models has not been extensively studied, which represents a significant gap in our current understanding of their capabilities.\n\nPrevious research has shown that large language models, such as GPT, are capable of performing a wide variety of language tasks when the task is presented in English, including tasks that require a deep understanding of linguistic nuances and complexities. However, investigations into the multilingual language abilities of these models have been limited, which has hindered our ability to fully comprehend the extent of their multilingual capabilities. Shi et al. (2023) explore this topic by applying the models to multilingual datasets, and measuring performance differences across languages, which has provided valuable insights into the models' linguistic abilities.\n\nHowever, they do not explore the underlying mechanisms of how LLMs perform different tasks, nor how this affects the results, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the models' multilingual abilities. Moreover, most LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023) are trained on datasets that are heavily skewed towards English, which leaves open the question of how multilingual abilities in such models are acquired, and whether this affects their performance on tasks presented in other languages. In this study, we present a systematic approach to analyzing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which involves a comprehensive examination of their linguistic abilities and a careful evaluation of their performance on a range of tasks.\n\nTo facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we propose categorizing language-dependent abilities into three distinct categories, which vary in the impact of language choice on the performance: Reasoning (least impact), Knowledge Access, and Articulation (most impact). We investigate a carefully selected set of tasks from these three categories by evaluating the multilingual abilities of an LLM using a novel prompting method which we call response back-translation (RBT). By comparing the generated answers, we can both measure multilingual performance of the LLM, but also determine the type of multilinguality they exhibit, which is a crucial aspect of understanding their linguistic capabilities.\n\nFor example, we examine the capabilities of LLMs on pun detection, a highly language-dependent task that requires a deep understanding of linguistic nuances and complexities. The results of our experiments show that the popular LLM \"GPT\" (1) achieves higher performance when the task is presented in English; (2) achieves higher performance on tasks that can be translated without altering the correct output; and (3) exhibits a mixture of coordinate and subordinate bilingualism.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language models have made great progress in natural language processing tasks. One of the most attractive pretraining paradigms is the auto-regressive language model, such as XLNet. With billions or even trillions of parameters, and abundant unlabeled training data, pre-trained language models can generate diverse and realistic sentences. Formally, autoregressive pre-trained language models model the probability distribution of text by breaking it down into parts, but this is a simplification of a more complex process. Those models are often trained on general-purpose corpora, leading to inconsistent sentences generated by these models that do not meet task requirements. To improve the applicability of pre-trained language models, making their output more task-specific has been an important goal in improving natural language generation. We use X1:i to denote the sequence of tokens from x1 to xi. Earlier works directly modeled conditional language generation by maximizing the likelihood of task-specific corpora. Class-conditional language models are those methods. Class-conditional language models usually suffer from corpus overfitting because the training data for specific attributes is limited. Bayesian language models are proposed to address the corpus overfitting problem. Bayesian language models attempt to find a generation path that matches the target attribute. Bayesian language models use a discriminator to model the class probability and then sample the desired output. Bayesian language models combine unconditional language generation and classification using the Bayes rule. Since the unconditional language generation model can be given by an off-the-shelf pre-trained language model, Bayesian language models only need to model the class probability. Bayesian language models typically train the discriminator with task-specific corpora. However, in inference, the discriminator receives text generated by pre-trained language models, which is different from the training corpus. The mismatch between training and inference limits the performance of Bayesian language models. We propose using pre-trained language models to extract features from task-specific corpora and use those features as input to the discriminator. Since pre-trained language models have been pre-trained on general-purpose corpora, it is reasonable to assume they have seen similar sentences. It is roughly equivalent to saying that the discriminator has been pre-trained on the large-scale general-purpose corpus. This mitigates the mismatch problem in Bayesian language models. However, this job is challenging. In the inference process, we need to calculate the probability distribution for each token. It is a huge cost to extract features for all tokens in the vocabulary. To address the efficiency problem, we introduce the Gemini discriminator to address the efficiency problem in language generation. The Gemini uses features extracted by pre-trained language models as input in training, and it has a small computational cost in inference. To improve the performance of Gemini, we adopt knowledge distillation in training. Moreover, inspired by nucleus sampling and decoding strategies, we design an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method in generation. We evaluated Gemini on two language generation tasks: sentiment control and topic control. 17th sentence", "scores": {"ppl": 68.78292846679688, "some": 0.8744219144185384, "bart": -1.732269525527954, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have significantly impacted natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One attractive pre-training paradigm is the auto-regressive language model, such as GPT2 and XLNet. With billions of parameters and abundant unlabeled training data, PLMs can generate diverse and realistic sentences. They model the probability distribution of text X = {x1, x2, ..., xT } using the chain rule:\n\nT (cid:89) p(X) = p(xi|x1, x2, ..., xi\u22121). (1) i=1\n\nHowever, these models are typically trained on general-purpose corpora and generate sentences inconsistent with task requirements. To enhance the applicability of PLMs, improving their performance has been a crucial task.\n\nControllable language generation aims to model p(X|a), where a is a desired attribute (e.g., topic, length, or sentiment). This can be expressed as:\n\np(X|a) = T (cid:89) i=1 p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a). (2)\n\nEarly works directly modeled p(X|a) by maximizing the likelihood of task-specific corpora, resulting in Class Conditional Language Models (CCLMs).\n\nSince the training data for specific attributes is limited, CCLMs often suffer from corpus overfitting. Bayesian Controllable Language Models (BCLMs) address this issue by finding a generation path that matches the target attribute. BCLMs use a discriminator to model the class probability p(a|X1:i) and sample the desired output according to the Bayes Rule:\n\np(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) \u221d p(a|X1:i)p(xi|X1:i\u22121). (3)\n\nWith the Bayes Rule, BCLMs transform the controllable language generation task into a combination of unconditional language generation and classification tasks. Given that p(xi|X1:i\u22121) can be provided by an off-the-shelf PLM (in this case, GPT2), BCLMs only need to model p(a|X1:i). However, in inference, the discriminator receives text generated by GPT2, which is different from the training corpus.\n\nWe propose using GPT2 to extract features from task-specific corpora, which are then used as input to the discriminator. This mitigates the mismatch problem in BCLMs. However, this approach poses a challenge. To calculate the probability distribution of xi, we need to compute p(a|X1:i\u22121, w) for all tokens w in the vocabulary, resulting in a significant computational cost.\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce the \"Gemini Discriminator\" (Gemini) for controllable language generation. Gemini uses features extracted by GPT2 in training and has a low computational cost in inference. To improve Gemini's performance, we adopt knowledge distillation in training. Additionally, inspired by nucleus sampling and GeDi's decoding strategy, we design an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method, which considers both fluency and attribute relevance in generation.\n\nWe experimented with Gemini on two controllable language generation tasks: sentiment control and topic control.

Not all police stations will allow you to file a police report online, but some will require you to do so in person at the police station. Typically, incidents involving lost or stolen property, damaged property, or vandalism, as well as financial crimes like theft or identity theft, are eligible for online reporting. If you can't file a report online, you will need to do so in person at the police station. On police department websites, you'll usually find information about the types of incidents you can report online, including eligible categories. Make sure the incident you want to report fits into one of these categories before proceeding. Incidents involving violent crime or crimes in progress should be reported by calling 911 or the police non-emergency number instead of filing an online report. Before starting the online reporting process, write down notes with specific facts and details related to the incident to help you enter the correct information. For example, you might write down the names of others who were involved or who witnessed the incident. You should also note the date and time the incident occurred and the street address of the specific location. If you have relevant documents or files, you may be able to upload them along with your report. In most cases, you cannot file an anonymous report online, but it's still a good idea to provide contact information, such as an email address and phone number, so police can follow up with you.

Think about what you want to happen during the conversation. Write it down to help you clarify your thoughts. Make a list of the important details you need to discuss. This will help you answer any questions they may have. Answering questions will calm them down and make the conversation more productive. \n\nWhen you want to spend the night at a friend's house, you'll need to know several details. These include whether her parents will be there, when the night will start, what you'll need to bring, and when your parents can pick you up. Having a phone number for your friend's parents can also be helpful. They can call her parents if needed. \n\nChoose a time to talk to your parents when they're not busy. Pick a time when you can have their full attention. If you can't figure out a good time, ask them when they're free. Don't try to draw out the conversation, as this will make you more nervous. \n\nAs soon as you get your parents together, start saying what you need to say. You could begin by saying, \"I have something I want to discuss with you.\" Start with a clear and direct statement. For instance, you could say, \"I'd like to go to the dance this Saturday night.\" \n\nIf you can't get the conversation started right away, it's okay to start with something else. Just make sure you get to the point eventually. A good way to convince someone to do something is to explain how it will benefit them. Think about how your parents will benefit from what you're doing. \n\nFor example, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out for a night, you could say, \"As an added bonus, you'd get the house all to yourself!\" Another example is if you're trying to get your parents to eat out somewhere, mention their favorite dishes. If you try to lie or give a half truth, your parents may not trust you in the future. \n\nThey can probably tell when you're lying, and this will damage your relationship with them. You might have a tendency to blame your parents in serious conversations. However, you should try to stick to what you're feeling or thinking. Use \"I\" instead of \"you\" when expressing your thoughts. \n\nFor example, say, \"I feel upset when I can't go out when my friends do,\" not \"You're awful for not letting me go out with my friends.\" The second statement puts your parents on their guard. The first one just expresses what you're feeling. \n\nHaving details to back up what you say can be very helpful. This is especially true when it comes to safety and other important issues. Having someone with more authority than you to back you up can also help persuade your parents. For instance, if you're trying to convince your parents that you should be in the band, you could have research articles stating how music can help you do better in math. \n\nYou could say, \"As this research shows, being in band can help me do better in math.\" If you are trying to get your parents to do something they don't want to do, then hearing their perspective may help you. They may have good points to bring up about the problem. In turn, you may be able to deal with those problems by finding solutions. \n\nIt's essential to approach your parents politely during the conversation.

This architecture involves multiple generative agents interacting and mimicking human behavior, enabling more realistic and engaging game experiences. This architecture involves a two-layer agent task planning model targeting strategic agents and tactical agents to plan tasks for the game confrontation process. The model enables more efficient and effective decision-making by leveraging the strengths of both strategic and tactical planning. The experiment demonstrates that the large language model outperforms Reinforcement learning AI and rule AI in intelligent decision-making, with improved intelligence, understandability, and generalization. This outcome highlights the potential of large language models in intelligent wargame and motivates further research in this area.

In the context of Bengali language, Salehin et al. (2019); Amin et al. (2021) conducted data collection from various news websites using web scraping techniques to gather high-quality data. They proposed an RNN-based encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism for headline generation, which improved the accuracy of generated headlines. Another notable resource for multilingual abstractive summarization, XL-Sum, was introduced by Hasan et al. (2021), which includes article-headline pairs in multiple languages, including Indian languages. The Indian language section of the XLSum dataset consists of 251K article-headline pairs sourced from BBC2, which can be used to train and evaluate headline generation models. To further advance research in Natural Language Generation (NLG) for Indian languages, Kumar et al. (2022) proposed the IndicNLG benchmark, encompassing five different NLG tasks, including a headline generation dataset (hereafter referred to as IndicHG dataset). This dataset comprises 1.31 million article-headline pairs across 11 Indian languages, which can be used to train and evaluate headline generation models. However, our analysis (detailed in Section 4) reveals serious quality issues, such as data contamination, rendering it unsuitable for training robust models. Despite its claimed size, the dataset\u2019s problematic samples significantly reduce its effective size by nearly half. To summarize our main contributions: 1. We present a large, multilingual headline generation dataset \"Mukhyansh\", comprising over 3.39 million news article-headline pairs across 8 Indian languages; namely Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati.\n\nNote that the output is within the 420-token limit.", "scores": {"ppl": 46.71566390991211, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.869787693023682, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs), autonomous vehicles, and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have emerged from this ongoing trend. Their engineering has become a highly effortful task due to the heterogeneous and interactive nature of these systems-of-systems, facing many challenges. One of these challenges is the need for collaboration among experts from different domains. This challenge manifests in the rising number of requirements that address stakeholders from heterogeneous domains. In systems engineering, particularly in the automotive domain, requirements are captured as documents containing text mainly in natural language, often with additional information provided through pictures or Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. Experts interpret these textual requirements to enter the design phase, and most often derive details of the implementation directly from them. The ambiguity of natural language, particularly when interpreted by experts from different backgrounds, as well as the increasing number of requirements, may result in decreasing product quality, system failures detected at late development stages, and hinder the implementation of functional safety standards such as ISO 26262. Furthermore, the document-based approach to requirements engineering prevents agile development, where automated analyses and syntheses should enable early error detection and fast feedback for developers. What is needed are tools to capture, analyze, and process requirements systematically during all phases of the development cycle. An approach to achieve this is Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), which utilizes models as primary development artifacts. These models serve as documentation and communication basis for engineers, but also as input for analyses and syntheses, such as verification, test case generation, or code generation. For instance, MDE can be applied to facilitate the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems. Approaches to introduce MDE in the automotive requirements engineering exist, but introducing MDE comes with initial costs and efforts for training domain experts in modeling, and most often, for translating many documents to models. An advantage of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) rather than general-purpose modeling languages such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is that their syntax and semantics can be designed to be intuitive for the model users. As requirements are captured in natural language, we assume that a textual DSL offering sentence structures and wording close to the current formulation of requirements increases intuitiveness of both usage and understanding of models in this DSL significantly. However, in addition to the DSL development costs and the DSL training, once the DSL is developed, the translation of old, unstructured requirements to models in the DSL can be a tremendous effort due to the high number of requirements, requiring time and modeling know-how from the translating developer.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose the application and evaluation of few-shot learning of large neural natural language models for the translation of given unstructured requirements to sentences incorporating the new formal DSL constructs. Such translation models can be used during the introduction phase of a DSL to automatically translate existing or legacy natural language requirements into the new DSL syntax and to correct natural language inputs in a smart editor when a requirement engineer writes a new requirement as natural text. With this automation supported by the fact that few-shot learning requires only a handful of translation examples to learn a given translation task, our aim is to facilitate the introduction of highly specialized requirement DSLs, targeting a single department of a company using specific wording or even a single project.\n\nOur approach is based on the technical foundations of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to capture requirements in the automotive domain.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "EQs are an incredible tool for focusing the sound of your instruments and eliminating unwanted frequencies. You can use EQs to either strip or boost high or low frequencies, which is particularly useful for drum kits. When recording drum kits, low frequencies can cause resonance, resulting in unwanted rumble in the kit's snare. You can roll off low-end frequencies with an EQ to achieve a purer sound. In percussion, snare drums sound more powerful with a boost in lower frequencies, while hi-hats and toms sound snappier with lower frequencies thinned out. A compressor limits the dynamic range in your mix, raising the volume of quiet parts and lowering the volume of loud parts. Compression can automatically smooth out irregularities caused by human error, ensuring consistency throughout a recording. When mixing a song, it's crucial to carefully balance the drums and bass, as lower frequency sound can be overpowering if not managed correctly. Each instrument should sound distinct yet cohesive with the whole, avoiding excessive brightness or darkness. Noise gates can cut out background noise below a minimum volume threshold, making them useful for recording in noisy environments. The way you place sound in the stereo field significantly impacts your mix's sound, so experiment with track placement to achieve the perfect balance. Place a keyboard track slightly off-center and position other tracks at various points in the stereo field for a more immersive sound.

Notably, their multilingual versions have shown impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual settings (Pires et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019), where they acquire proficiency to handle tasks in different languages without requiring data from those languages. However, multilingual PLMs are typically constructed using stacked transformer layers or their variants, incorporating self-attention mechanisms to capture diverse and distant dependencies among tokens. The use of self-attention introduces significant computational complexity, resulting in increased inference complexity for multilingual PLMs. Consequently, the inference complexity of multilingual PLMs has become a bottleneck, limiting their deployment on devices sensitive to latency and constrained by computational resources. To address this issue and fulfill the stringent requirements for efficient inference in applications, various methods have been proposed to accelerate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) inference. 9. These methods include model compression (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020, 2019), early exiting (Xin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021), and model cascading (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). Among these, model cascading methods are particularly appealing due to their flexibility to adapt to the latest, incrementally powerful PLMs and their ability to eliminate the need to train an inference-efficient model from scratch on the pre-training corpora. Model cascading methods involve the aggregation of multiple PLMs with different sizes, where confidence scores are computed sequentially to determine the appropriate model to employ. Once a confidence score surpasses a threshold, the corresponding model is selected, and the inference process ends. 16. Cascade-based models, however, exhibit notable limitations in cross-lingual scenarios, where the confidence score, which measures the probability of the current prediction being correct in cascade-based models, is often determined by the maximum output of English data. To address this limitation, we introduce a plugin calibration step at the base of multilingual PLMs (mPLMs). Initially, we normalize the logits to alleviate over-confidence during model fine-tuning. Subsequently, we implement a temperature scaling step to adjust the logits with a learnable scalar parameter. The proposed framework calibrates each individual model in the cascade, providing more reliable confidence scores and enhancing the model's performance and generalization capabilities. This, in turn, leads to consistent improvements in efficiency and accuracy across different languages. Importantly, the proposed framework only requires an extra calibration module at the base of mPLMs, preserving the original architectures of mPLMs. Hence, it demonstrates flexibility to accommodate the latest models with minimal additional training overhead.

Then, carefully cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label each one by color and grain direction, noting any specific instructions or requirements, as incorrect labeling can result in incorrect assembly and potentially create a project that is unsafe or structurally unsound. To achieve accurate and smooth tracing, place the pattern on a stable surface, such as a lightbox or a sheet of glass, to prevent movement or distortion, and use a thin permanent marker to carefully trace the outline, maintaining a steady hand and avoiding smudges or smears. Leaving a small margin, approximately one centimeter or less, between the pieces is essential, as it prevents potential issues with adhesion or fit, allowing the copper foil to be applied smoothly and evenly, which is critical for a successful project. When marking the glass, use a marker with good visibility, such as a specialty black pen or a permanent marker, to make it easier to see the lines and shapes as you cut and assemble the pieces, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring a professional finish. It is also necessary to use a marker with good visibility when marking the pattern on the graph paper, to minimize the risk of mistakes and ensure that the project's design is accurately represented. Carefully apply the copper foil to the pattern pieces, ensuring that it is smooth and even, and avoid any wrinkles or air bubbles that can compromise the project's integrity. To maintain a smooth and even application, it is essential to apply the copper foil in a well-ventilated area, away from any heat sources or direct sunlight. For a successful project, it is crucial to ensure that all the pattern pieces fit together correctly, and any gaps or misalignments can be addressed before applying the copper foil, as this will prevent any potential issues with the project's stability and structural integrity.

When reading a poem, it's crucial to pay attention to the title and think about it in the context of the rest of the poem. This will help you better understand the poem's meaning and message. Ask yourself, What does the poem mean in the context of the rest of the poem? How does the title deepen the meaning of the poem overall? Sometimes, the title will describe who the speaker or intended audience of the poem is, for example, a poem with the title \u201cFor Mother\u201d or \u201cTo My Lover.\u201d Other times, the title may describe the subject, genre, or tone of the poem, for example, the title \u201cSonnet 18\u201d or \u201cDigging.\u201d The poet and the speaker are not always the same person, which can create interesting complexities in the poem. A poem's speaker might be a character within the broader context of the poem. Note if the poet uses a first person speaker (\u201cI\u201d), a second person speaker (\u201cyou\u201d), or a third person speaker (\u201cshe, he, they\u201d). You can usually identify the speaker without careful analysis, but if you aren't sure, don't worry about it for now. Just make sure you understand what type of speaker is in the poem when you start analyzing the meaning of the poem. When you run across a word you don't understand, stop where you're at and look up the meaning of that word in a dictionary. Defining unfamiliar words can help to deepen your understanding of the poem.  You may also want to look up possible synonyms for that word using a thesaurus. After defining that word, plug the definition or synonym into the poem and re-read the line with that meaning. You can apply this same practice to phrases or proper nouns you don't know, but defining the meaning of these elements may require additional research in other texts or online. The tone and mood of the poem are often created by the word choice and the language used in the poem. For instance, a poet may use vivid imagery to create a sense of wonder or a sense of dread. You may also get a sense of the mood and tone of the poem by listening to the rhythms of the poem when you read it out loud. For example, you may have a poem that has a humorous tone and a light mood, such as the poem \u201cDirty Face\u201d by Shel Silverstein. Or you may read a poem that has a more sinister or ominous tone, such as \u201cThe Raven\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe. Understanding the tone and mood of the poem is essential to grasping its overall message. You should get a sense of when the poem was written and why the poem was written, or the context of the poem. Maybe an historical event occurred around the time the poem was written or perhaps a certain style of poetry was popular when the poem was published. Maybe the poet was influenced by a certain painting or art performance when they wrote the poem. Learning about the context of the poem can help to deepen your understanding of the poem and provide a more thorough reading of the piece. You may do research on the context of the poem using other texts, scholarly journals, or online sources. You can also consider when the poem was published and use this date to help situate it within the history of poetry and writing. Additionally, you can research the poet's personal life and experiences to see if there are any connections to the poem. Patterns and repetition in the poem are often used to reinforce a certain theme or idea. The poet may use a line more than once throughout the poem like a refrain to remind the reader of a certain idea. Or they may use a pattern of words or a pattern of organization to create a certain meaning in the poem. Ask yourself if the poet consistently relies on certain images, topics, or other similar words. Groups of similar words can indicate a pattern. For example, you may notice that the poem repeats the same line over and over again throughout the poem, such as \u201conly this and nothing more.\u201d You may then consider why the poet repeats this phrase throughout the poem. Often, the phrase will relate back to a specific theme or idea in the poem. Another pattern you could look for is how the ideas in the poem are ordered. Are they placed in a chronological order, moving from present to future? Or do the ideas jump around in time, moving from past to present to future and then back to past? You may also notice if the poem does not have any time-based ordering and instead seems ordered by another organizing idea, such as scraps of conversation in the poem or the use of another theme. For example, maybe the poem has a water-based theme, with the poet describing an ocean in one line and shallow pond in the next. Or maybe the poem has a theme of lost love, and each stanza explores a moment of lost love for the speaker. Once you have considered all the elements of form and content in the poem, you should try to summarize the poem in one to two sentences. Write down what you believe to be the overall meaning or theme of the poem. Try to rely on the content and form of the poem as well as your impressions and thoughts. Ask yourself, What is this poem about? For example, you may sum up the poem \u201cThe Raven\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe with the sentence: This poem is about the speaker\u2019s fear and terror of death, personified in the raven at the door. Do not be too concerned about having the right reading of the poem. Poetry is meant to be subjective, and your interpretation of the poem could be just as right as someone else\u2019s interpretation.

Sentences using vague expressions, such as \"The patient was maintained on a high dose of insulin,\" can be challenging to interpret due to the unclear exact amount of insulin used. Gradability, a semantic property, allows words to describe the intensity of a measure in context, making comparative constructs possible.\n\nGradable adjectives inherently possess a degree of vagueness and are used to express epistemic uncertainties. While judgments are strong in extreme cases, there exist borderline cases where it is difficult to ascribe an adjective. For instance, some amounts of insulin would be considered a high dose by all, while others would never be considered a high dose, leaving a middle range where experts may have differing thresholds for what constitutes a high dose.\n\nBroadly, gradable adjectives can be classified into two categories based on their interpretation as measure functions. Adjectives like \"tall,\" \"heavy,\" and \"expensive\" are associated with clear numerical quantities (height, weight, cost), whereas adjectives like \"clever,\" \"beautiful,\" and \"naive\" are more complex and underspecified for the exact feature being measured.\n\nGradability is not limited to adjectives and extends to other parts of speech, such as adverbs (e.g., \"slightly,\" \"marginally\"), nouns (e.g., \"joy,\" \"euphoria\"), and verbs (e.g., \"drizzling,\" \"pouring\"). Recent studies in the NLP community have investigated gradable adjectives, including their presence in clinical text.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in clinical text. We identify these adjectives using a method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000) and found that they have a substantial presence (30%) in our data. Furthermore, we demonstrate a specific pattern in which gradable adjectives are used, with some medical concepts more likely to be modified by these adjectives than others.", "scores": {"ppl": 20.376039505004883, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.184295177459717, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

After ordering a drink from my bartender friend at a local bar, I relaxed while going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, enjoying the familiar atmosphere and friendly service that made me feel right at home, and as I sipped my drink, I felt my stress melting away as the bartender engaged me in conversation, asking about my week and sharing stories about his own, and the way he remembered my name and favorite drink made me feel seen and appreciated, and I was particularly impressed by his ability to balance multiple conversations at once and keep track of every drink order, and as the night wore on, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence. My friend then introduced me to another patron at the bar, a guy with a warm smile who was sitting alone at the end of the bar, nursing a drink and looking a bit out of place, and my friend thought we might hit it off, so he started telling me about this guy's background and interests, and as we listened, we both sensed a spark of connection, and I was fascinated by the way he laughed when my friend told a joke, and I couldn't help but notice the way his eyes lit up when he talked about his favorite hobbies, and as we continued to chat, I found myself feeling drawn to his kind and gentle nature. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced me to a guy who had just moved to the area for a job, and as we started talking, I learned that he was a musician, and his passion for music was infectious, and as we discovered our shared love of music, we found ourselves lost in conversation, and the hours flew by as we talked about everything from our favorite artists to our experiences with music festivals, and I was particularly impressed by his talent for playing the guitar and his ability to write his own songs, and as the night wore on, we started to share stories about our favorite concerts and the memories that came with them. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music; we played different songs we liked on the jukebox, laughing and singing along to our favorite tunes, and as we let loose and had fun, our connection grew stronger with each passing minute, and I found myself feeling a deep sense of comfort and ease in his presence, and we even started to share stories about our first concerts and the memories that came with them, and as we reminisced about the past, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement for the future and the possibilities that lay ahead. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any contact information with one another; as we parted ways, I had a feeling that I might see him again someday, and as I looked into his eyes, I saw a spark of hope that we might reconnect, and I couldn't shake the feeling that our paths were meant to cross again, and as I walked home, I couldn't stop thinking about him and the way he made me feel, and I found myself wondering if I would ever see him again, and I couldn't help but notice the way he smiled at me as we said our goodbyes, and I felt a sense of longing that I had never felt before.

When can your parents pick you up? Having a phone number for your friend's parents can help. That way, your parents can call her parents. It's best to talk when your parents are not busy. Pick a time when they have a moment to sit down with you. They should give you their full attention. If you can't figure out a time, ask your parents when a good time would be.

Think about how your parents will benefit from what you're doing. As an example, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out. You could say, \"You'd get the house all to yourself!\" If you're trying to get your parents to eat out somewhere. Mention their favorite dishes. If you try to lie or give a half truth, your parents may not trust you. They know you pretty well and can probably tell when you're lying. You might have a tendency to blame your parents.

Use \"I\" instead of \"you.\" Say, \"I feel upset when I can't go out,\" not \"You're awful for not letting me go out.\" The second one puts your parents on their guard, while the first one just expresses what you're feeling. If you can, have details to back up what you say. Having someone with more authority to back you up can help persuade your parents. For instance, if you're trying to convince your parents that you should be in the band. You could have research articles stating how music can help you do better in math. You could say, \"As this research shows, being in band can help me do better in math.\" If you are trying to get your parents to do something they don't want to do. Then hearing why may help you.

Relevant information is often distributed across multiple sentences. Key to finding the correct answer is understanding sentence relations. Consider the example in fig. 1. To answer the question about Sally's shoes, we need to infer a causality relation between two sentences.\n\nPrior work has demonstrated the value of discourse relations in question answering. However, these approaches rely on external discourse analyzers. Such pipeline designs limit opportunities for guiding the discourse parser. \n\nGiven various discourse frameworks, it's unclear what the optimal set of discourse annotations is. A generic discourse parser may introduce additional errors due to mismatched training and application datasets. The largest discourse treebanks are based on newspaper corpora, which differ significantly from text used in machine comprehension corpora.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach for incorporating discourse structure into machine comprehension. Rather than using a standalone parser, the model induces relations while optimizing a task-specific objective. This design biases the model to learn relations optimized for the machine comprehension task. In contrast to a generic discourse analyzer, our method can utilize additional information available in the machine comprehension context.\n\nFor instance, question types provide valuable cues for determining discourse relations, and thus can facilitate learning. We implement these ideas in a discriminative log-linear model with hidden variables, jointly identifying relevant sentences, establishing relations, and predicting an answer. 7. Since the same set of sentences can give rise to multiple questions, we do not limit the model to a single discourse relation, but rather model a distribution over possible relations.\n\nTo guide the model towards linguistically plausible discourse relations, we add a few seed markers that are typical of each relation. The model predicts relations not only based on the sentences, but also incorporates information about the question, by decomposing the dependencies between model components, we can effectively train the model using a standard gradient descent approach.\n\nWe evaluate our model using a recently released machine comprehension dataset. In this corpus, roughly half of the questions rely on multiple sentences in the passage to generate the correct answer. 12. For baselines, we use the best published results on this dataset. Our results demonstrate that our relation-aware model outperforms the individual baselines by up to 5.7% and rivals the performance of a state-of-the-art combination system.

I returned to the apartment after spending the weekend with my folks to find that they had moved all their belongings out, leaving behind a bare and empty space that was a stark contrast to the warm and welcoming home I had grown to love. Sally was actually in the bathroom, cleaning up, and she looked at me with a flustered and angry expression, her face beet red from scrubbing the sink and her eyes flashing with annoyance. Sally told me that she was frustrated because Tasha had not notified her that they had to vacate the apartment by Tuesday, and this sudden notice had left Sally scrambling to find a new place to live. My jaw dropped in shock as I stood there, frozen in place, trying to process the news and wondering how I was going to find a new place to live in such a short amount of time. Tasha's communication had been subpar, which was not like her, and I couldn't help but wonder what had caused her to change and become so distant and unresponsive. It was Sunday night, and I was panicking because I had not planned on moving and now had only 24 hours to find a new place to live, and the thought of having to scramble to find a new home in such a short amount of time was overwhelming. I went to the mail room and found some empty boxes, which I could use to pack my belongings, and I sent out text messages to see if anyone knew of a room available for rent, but the response was slow and uncertain. I texted my parents to ask for their advice, and my dad said it was a blessing in disguise, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was right and if this was an opportunity for me to start fresh and move forward with my life. Sally had done all the cleaning, and Tasha had already left, so I only had a small section to pack up, but even that was a daunting task given the time constraint and the stress I was feeling. My dad's calm and reassuring nature helped to alleviate my anxiety, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me as I talked to him on the phone and realized that I wasn't alone in this situation. I was surprised that I had not panicked earlier, given the rumored housing shortage on and off campus, and the fact that many students were graduating this year and would be looking for new places to live.

Phil had graduated last year and was working for a small boutique law firm outside the city, where he rented a charming artist studio in a picturesque neighborhood that was a far cry from the hustle and bustle of campus life. Phil had spent the summer applying to law firms on the east coast and had signed a contract with a new firm, where he started working the following week, and I was a bit envious of his new job and the opportunities it would bring him. Phil offered me the use of his studio, which his landlord agreed to rent to me at a reasonable price, and I was thrilled to have secured a new place to live, especially given the circumstances. I spent the day packing boxes in my small car, hauling them to and from storage, which was a physically demanding task that left me exhausted and drained. I could only carry what I could myself, so I had to pack lightly and make multiple trips, which left me exhausted and struggling to keep up with the demands of the task. I was emotionally drained, and it was only when the adrenaline finally wore off that I began to feel the full effects of my ordeal, the weight of which was crushing me and leaving me feeling defeated. I finally found a place to live, and I was grateful to Phil for offering me the use of his studio, which had saved me from a difficult situation and given me a new chance at life.

Despite my initial concerns, I knew that I would be able to find a new place to live, but I was still nervous about the whole situation, which was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety and keeping me up at night. I was able to find a place to live, and it was all thanks to Phil, who had offered me the use of his studio, which was a great opportunity for me to start fresh and move forward with my life, and I was grateful for his kindness and generosity.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "EQs can be an incredible tool for focusing the sound of your instruments, with which you can either strip or boost high or low frequencies, particularly useful with drum kits, as they help balance the sound and create a more cohesive mix. When drum kit sounds are recorded, the vibrations caused by its low frequencies can resonate with other parts of the kit, making it sound like a rumble in the kit's snare, and these sounds can be 'rolled off' at the low end with an EQ, creating a purer sound. These effects can be particularly useful when working with specific instruments, such as snare drums, which generally sound more powerful with a boost in the lower frequencies, whereas hi-hats and toms often sound snappier and punchier with lower frequencies thinned out. A compressor or an EQ can also be used to balance the sound, as a compressor limits the amount of frequency expressed in your mix, and due to human error, you can expect that no single instrument will not be perfectly constant throughout an entire recording, so compression can smooth these irregularities automatically for you. Drums and bass form the rhythmic foundation of your song, so be sure to set aside time to carefully listen to them, as lower frequency sounds can be overpowering if not managed carefully, and every part should sound distinct but also cohesive with the whole; if one instrument is excessively bright or dark, it will sound out of place, and think of the tracks of your mix as members of a choir, each part distinct yet working together as a collective. For specific instruments that aren't as regularly occurring in your mix, it may be easiest to lower your fader, making it easier to filter out unwanted lower volume percussion, which can be challenging to time fade with each sound's 'punch', and how sound moves through the stereo field has a definite effect on the sound you produce in your mix; to find the perfect balance, you'll need to experiment with how you distribute your tracks. The chorus effect adds layers of slightly different timbres and intonations to a track, making it sound like multiple instruments are playing, which can be particularly useful for electric keyboards and guitar parts, and there are many different kinds of automation you can use to improve the musicality of your mix; for example, you might automate your master bus to create louder choruses than your verses, which would create a more prominent chorus in your mix; you can also automate effects returns, which can be useful if you want a reverb or delay to be less prominent in certain sections of a song. While using your EQ, noise gates, and other effects, constantly listen to your entire production; make small adjustments to each track while keeping the whole in mind; with each change, listen to your mix anew, even if individual parts sound great, the complete product must sound great as well.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.882564544677734, "some": 0.8967951138814291, "bart": -1.1587352752685547, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's a revised version of the provided text, ensuring fluency while retaining its original meaning and meeting the requirements of more than 480 tokens, 15 sentences, and each sentence having more than 14 tokens:\n\nRecently, pre-trained multilingual language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), and various other models (Chi et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2022) have significantly enhanced multilingual language understanding by pre-training large Transformer models on web-scale corpora (such as Wikipedia, CommonCrawl). These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual transfer and numerous multilingual NLP tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Pires et al., 2019), which is a testament to their robustness and versatility in handling diverse linguistic patterns. However, a real-world system will inevitably encounter real-world noise, such as linguistic variations and common errors observed in textual data, that are often absent from benchmark datasets. While prior works have focused on this issue of robustness in monolingual settings (Peng et al., 2021; Sengupta et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020), investigation into this matter has been scarce for multilingual settings, which is a significant gap in the existing literature. The lack of robustness in multilingual models can lead to reduced performance and decreased accuracy, making it essential to develop methods that can improve their robustness across various languages and noise types. In this paper, we study the effect of realistic noise in multilingual settings and propose methods to boost the robustness of multilingual language models across four NLP tasks: Intent Classification (IC), Slot Labeling (SL), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Due to the lack of multilingual noisy evaluation data, we synthesize benchmarks by mining noise from publicly available corpora and injecting them into the test sets associated with each of the four tasks, which allows us to create a more realistic and challenging test environment. We conduct human validation to ensure that this noised data is indeed realistic (see examples from MultiATIS++ in Figure 1) and identify the variety of noise-types seen across languages (in \u00a73), which highlights the potential of our testset in evaluating (and motivating future research on) multilingual robustness. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate the importance of considering noise in multilingual settings, as it can have a significant impact on model performance and accuracy. To benchmark the performance of multilingual systems, we consider accuracy metrics on two utterance-level tasks (IC% and NLI%) and F-scores on two token-level classification tasks (SL-F1 and NER-F1). Specifically, we seek to evaluate the model's performance on the noised version of the test datasets in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting, where we have training data for a task available only in one language (in our case, English) and test-data in various languages (Liu et al., 2019, 2020). While training data augmentation increases model robustness for monolingual (i.e., English) settings, it is not immediately obvious if these robustness gains can transfer across languages, as error types can often be language-specific. For example, typos in Devanagari script can differ from those seen in Latin scripts (e.g., (cid:45)(cid:107)(cid:1) (cid:108) \u2192 (cid:115)(cid:107)u(cid:108) in Devanagari showcases that a joined character is incorrectly separated into two characters in the word 'school'). Thus, to improve the robustness of pre-trained multilingual models across noise in all languages, we propose Robust Contrastive Pretraining (RCP) that couples multilingual noisy data-augmentation with a contrastive learning loss term during pre-training; this encourages the model to develop similar representations for the original and the noised version of a sentence. Our approach is motivated by the need to improve the robustness of multilingual models in real-world settings, where they will inevitably encounter a wide range of noise types and linguistic variations. We evaluate our method on the noisy test sets and demonstrate that it improves the multilingual model performance across all metrics and multilingual tasks, including IC% by 4.9% on MultiATIS++, 4.1% on MultiSNIPS; SL-F1 by 18.4 on MultiATIS++, 8.6 on MultiSNIPS; NER-F1 by 2.9 on WikiANN; and NLI% by 0.7% on XNLI.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "The title can contain significant clues about the nature of the poem, so it is essential to carefully consider its significance and its relationship to the rest of the poem. Carefully read the title and consider its meaning within the context of the poem, taking into account the poet's intentions and the cultural and historical context of the poem. Ask yourself what the poem's meaning is in the context of the other lines and stanzas, and how they contribute to the overall meaning of the poem and its significance. In what ways does the title contribute to the poem's overall meaning and significance, and how does it relate to the poet's intentions and the cultural and historical context? Sometimes the title describes the speaker or the audience of the poem, as in the case of poems with titles like \u201cFor Mother\u201d or \u201cTo My Lover.\u201d Other times, the title may describe the subject, genre, or tone of the poem, as in titles like \u201cSonnet 18\u201d or \u201cDigging.\u201d The poet and the speaker of the poem are not always the same individual, and this can add depth and complexity to the poem. In many cases, the poem's speaker is a character within the narrative, adding depth and complexity to the poem. Determine the type of speaker used by the poet in the poem, such as a first-person narrator, a third-person narrator, or a character within the narrative. You can often identify the speaker without close analysis, but if unsure, it's best to set it aside for now and continue with the analysis. Ensure that you understand the type of speaker in the poem, as this understanding will help you analyze its meaning, understand the poet's intentions, and appreciate the poem's complexities. If you encounter an unfamiliar word, look it up in a dictionary or use a thesaurus to find potential synonyms and consider their significance in the context of the poem. You can also circle or underline unfamiliar words to remind yourself to look them up later and consider their significance and impact on the poem's meaning. Understanding unfamiliar words can improve your comprehension of the poem's meaning, facilitate analysis of its themes and ideas, and help you appreciate the poem's complexities. You can also use a thesaurus to find potential synonyms for unfamiliar words or phrases, consider their impact on the poem's meaning, and replace them with their definitions or synonyms. Once you understand the word, replace it with its definition or synonym, and re-read the line to see how it affects the overall meaning of the poem and its significance. This method can also be applied to unfamiliar phrases, proper nouns, or other terms that require research to understand their meanings and significance in the poem's context and how they relate to the poet's intentions. The tone and mood of the poem are often established by the poet's word choice, language, and rhythm when read aloud, and can be sensed by listening to the poem's rhythm and sound devices, such as alliteration and assonance. You can sense the poem's mood and tone by listening to its rhythm and sound devices, such as alliteration and assonance, when reading it aloud, and consider how they contribute to the overall meaning and significance of the poem. For example, a poem like Shel Silverstein's \u201cDirty Face\u201d might have a humorous tone and lighthearted mood, which can add to the overall enjoyment of the poem and make it more accessible to readers. Alternatively, you may read a poem with a darker or more ominous tone, such as Edgar Allan Poe's \u201cThe Raven,\u201d which can create a sense of foreboding and mystery and engage readers in a deeper way. Understand the historical context in which the poem was written, including the cultural and social influences that shaped its meaning and significance, as well as the poet's intentions and the cultural and historical context of the poem. Perhaps the poem was written during a significant historical event, reflects the prevailing poetic style of its time, or responds to a particular cultural or social issue, which can add depth and complexity to the poem and its meaning. Maybe the poet was inspired by a specific artwork or performance when writing the poem, which can add to the overall meaning and significance of the poem and provide additional insights into the poet's intentions and the cultural and historical context. Understanding the poem's context, including its historical context, literary influences, and cultural references, can help you understand its meaning, appreciate its complexities, and gain a deeper understanding of the poet's intentions and the cultural and historical context. To research the poem's context, consult other texts, academic journals, or online sources, and consider how they relate to the poem's meaning, significance, and authorial intentions. Consider the poem's publication date, historical context, and authorial intentions, and use this information to situate the poem within the larger context of poetic history and development, and appreciate its significance and impact on the literary canon. The repetition of specific patterns or phrases in the poem often serves to emphasize a particular theme or idea, adding depth to the meaning, reinforcing the poet's message, and creating a sense of unity and coherence. A repeated line or phrase can serve as a refrain, emphasizing the poem's central idea or theme, and creating a sense of unity and coherence. Determine whether the poet frequently employs specific images, themes, or words throughout the poem, and consider how they contribute to the overall meaning, significance, and authorial intentions. Grouping similar words and phrases can reveal patterns and help you understand the poet's intentions and the overall structure of the poem, as well as the cultural and historical context in which the poem was written. For example, a repeated line like \u201conly this and nothing more\u201d can be a powerful device in the poem, emphasizing its central theme, idea, and authorial intentions, and creating a sense of unity and coherence. Think about why the poet has chosen to repeat this phrase, its impact on the poem's meaning, and how it contributes to the overall theme and tone, as well as the cultural and historical context. The repeated phrase is often connected to a central theme or idea in the poem, reinforcing its significance, impact, and authorial intentions, and creating a sense of unity and coherence. Consider how the poet has arranged the ideas and themes in the poem, including the use of chronology, imagery, symbolism, and other literary devices, and how they contribute to the overall meaning and significance. Consider whether the ideas follow a chronological order, jump around in time, or use non-linear structures and narrative techniques to create a sense of complexity and depth, and add to the overall meaning and significance of the poem. You may also notice if the poem lacks a chronological ordering, instead being organized by elements like dialogue, themes, imagery, symbolism, or other literary devices, which can add to the overall complexity and depth of the poem and create a sense of unity and coherence. For instance, a poem with a water-based theme might describe an ocean and a shallow pond in consecutive lines, using imagery and symbolism to create a sense of connection, unity, and depth. Alternatively, a poem with a theme of lost love might explore different moments of loss in each stanza or section, such as in a poem that uses non-linear narrative structure, imagery, and symbolism, and create a sense of complexity and depth. After analyzing the poem's form, content, and literary devices, try to synthesize its meaning into one or two sentences that capture the poem's overall meaning, significance, and authorial intentions. Make a note of your interpretation of the poem's overall meaning, theme, and significance, and consider how it relates to the poet's intentions, the cultural context, and the historical context.

Maybe she'll lean in close and rest her body against yours. There will be many excuses or reasons why both of you are always touching. She smiles at you a lot. She might catch your eye across the room and give you a sweet, unsolicited smile. She draws attention to her body. She might bite her lip, fix her hair, or cross and uncross her legs. It's possible she's doing these things unconsciously, but these subtle moves draw your attention to a specific part of her body. She gives you special hugs. If she's not a hugger, then it's easy to tell when she's giving a hug reserved especially for you. It's a way for her to get closer to you and show affection. Even if you're not sure it's a special hug, be happy you're receiving such a nice gesture from her. An interested girl will attempt to give you subtle suggestions through her speech. So it's essential to learn to read between the lines. A simple \"hello\" could have seductive intentions if you listen closely enough to the way she says it. She laughs at your dumb jokes. Your friends might laugh at the same joke, but when she hears it, it's hilarious. She wants you to feel like the star of the show, but don't get this mixed up with awkward laughter. She compliments you a lot. However, some girls might insult you instead. This is an age-old flirting technique used by almost everyone. It lowers the self-esteem of the target and oddly, it makes the insulter seem much more attractive. Don't confuse this with a girl who's genuinely not interested in you. A girl who consistently gives hurtful insults probably means she does not like you. A girl might change her behavior around you. You can usually see how she behaves around her friends. Watch how she reacts when she realizes you're around. Pay attention to how her friends behave around you. Don't assume a change in behavior automatically means she's interested in you. Try playing along if you're still unsure. Flirt with her lightly. This approach can be fun for both of you and keep things interesting. Share subtle insights about yourself to keep her curious. Some girls, even if they're playing coy, might not respond well to this tactic. Adapt to her approach and show her how much you're willing to do to win her over. The worst thing you can do is become overly fixated on being with her. If she says no or tells you to stop contacting her, respect her wishes and back off.

This could be a sign that she wants you to feel like the star of the show.\n- She compliments you frequently, telling you that you're funny, kind, and have nice hair. However, some girls might do the opposite and insult you, which can be an age-old flirting technique used by almost everyone.\n- She might change drastically around you, becoming nervous or extremely aloof or flirtatious, which can signify that she feels differently about you.\n- You can usually tell what her normal behavior is like when she's around her friends. If you can, observe her behavior without her knowing that you're in the room, and watch if she changes once she notices you.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that a change in behavior doesn't necessarily mean she's into you. She could be playing hard to get or is just genuinely not interested. If you're still not sure, take a turn at the game and flirt with her sparingly. Keep her guessing if you're really interested in her, as it's fun for both of you and keeps things fresh and entertaining.\n\nStay mysterious by dropping hints about yourself to keep her curious about who you are. This can make you look intriguing and more attractive. However, some girls might not appreciate this approach, as the point of playing hard to get is to force the person you're interested in to work harder for you - not less.\n\nUltimately, you should let her decide how to let you know whether or not she likes you. The worst thing you can do is become obsessed with wanting to be with her, as this can lead to incidents of harassment on your part. No means no, and if she rejects your advances or tells you to stop contacting her, respect her wishes and stop.\n\nDon't ask her out constantly or demand her attention all the time. Don't stalk her or her friends to find information, as this is a clear sign of disrespect and can make you look desperate. Respect her boundaries and give her space if she needs it.\n\nHere are some key takeaways to remember:\n\n- Even if a girl seems to be playing hard to get, it may indicate that she is genuinely interested in you.\n- An interested girl will often send out subtle signs that she likes you, such as constant touching, smiling, and drawing attention to her body.\n- She might give you special hugs, laugh at your jokes, and compliment you frequently.\n- However, a change in behavior doesn't necessarily mean she's into you, so take a turn at the game and flirt with her sparingly.\n- Stay mysterious by dropping hints about yourself to keep her curious about who you are.\n- Ultimately, you should let her decide how to let you know whether or not she likes you.\n- Respect her boundaries and give her space if she needs it.\n- No means no, and if she rejects your advances or tells you to stop contacting her, respect her wishes and stop.\n\nBy following these tips, you can better understand whether a girl is interested in you and how to approach her in a respectful and confident manner.", "scores": {"ppl": 14.721266746520996, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -1.5047228336334229, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

My friend introduced me to the guy who had just moved to the area for a job; we were only around five people in the bar at the time. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music, sharing stories about our favorite artists, and played different songs we liked on the jukebox, laughing and sharing stories as we discovered our shared interests, our conversation flowing effortlessly, and at one point, we even started singing along to our favorite tunes together. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again; it was as if fate had brought us together for a reason. I went back to the same bar two nights later and was thrilled to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar, feeling a spark of excitement at the chance to reconnect and start a new conversation, and as our eyes met, I couldn't help but feel an undeniable chemistry. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and had a brief conversation about making plans to see one another the next day, our chemistry growing with every passing minute, and we both felt an excitement building up inside us as we discussed our plans.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "As machine learning models become increasingly powerful, researchers are investing more in testing their capabilities and limitations to better understand their strengths and weaknesses. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been extensively studied to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Researchers typically select models for testing and devise specialized benchmarks tailored to specific research questions. They then evaluate the models on these benchmarks, analyze the results, and draw conclusions. These standard workflows enable researchers to gain valuable insights into the models' performance, including their strengths and weaknesses, and identify potential areas for improvement. To determine whether Large Multimodal Models can recognize colors, we need to test their performance on color recognition tasks. Experimental evaluation requires careful consideration of several key factors, including experimental design, data quality, and model performance. Designing the color palette is a crucial consideration, including the number of colors and their complexity, to ensure accurate results. Experimental validation involves designing benchmarks, testing models, and analyzing results, which are typically performed by researchers, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. To address the challenges associated with evaluating Large Multimodal Models, we have developed a framework that can autonomously design and execute experiments to evaluate their performance. Our framework, APEX, generates a scientific report through a series of experiments. APEX works by processing the user request and generating a suitable benchmark. It then conducts the experiment to determine whether the report's findings adequately address the user's question and provide a comprehensive answer. If not, APEX creates a new benchmark and runs more experiments, iteratively refining the process until APEX and the LLM determine the report is comprehensive enough and meets the user's requirements.

Relevant information may be distributed across multiple sentences. Understanding sentence relations is key to finding the correct answer. \n\nConsider the example in fig. 1. To answer the question about why Sally put on her shoes, we need to infer that She put on her shoes and She went outside to walk are connected by a causality relation. \n\nPrior work has demonstrated the value of discourse relations in question answering (Jansen et al., 2014). Traditionally, however, these approaches rely on outputs from off-the-shelf discourse analyzers. Pipeline designs provide limited opportunities for guiding the discourse parser based on the end task.\n\nGiven a wide spectrum of discourse frameworks, it is not clear a priori what the optimal set of discourse annotations is for the task. A generic discourse parser may introduce additional errors due to the mismatch between its training corpus and a dataset used in an application. In fact, the largest discourse treebanks are based on newspaper corpora (Prasad et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2002), which differ significantly in style from text used in machine comprehension corpora (Richardson et al., 2013). \n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach for incorporating discourse structure into machine comprehension applications. We induce relations between sentences while optimizing a task-specific objective. This design biases the model to learn relations at a granularity optimized for the machine comprehension task. \n\nWe implement these ideas in a discriminative log-linear model with hidden variables. The model jointly identifies relevant sentences, establishes relations between them, and predicts an answer. Since the same set of sentences can give rise to multiple questions, we do not limit the model to a single discourse relation, but rather model a distribution over possible relations. During training, we only have access to questions and gold answers. Since relevant sentences and their relations are not known, we model them as hidden variables. To guide the model towards linguistically plausible discourse relations, we add a few seed markers that are typical of each relation. The model predicts relations not only based on the sentences, but also incorporates information about the question. By decomposing the dependencies between model components, we can effectively train the model using a standard gradient descent approach. \n\nWe evaluate our model using a recently released machine comprehension dataset (Richardson et al., 2013). In this corpus, roughly half of the questions rely on multiple sentences in the passage to generate the correct answer. For baselines, we use the best published results on this dataset. Our results demonstrate that our relation-aware model outperforms the individual baselines by up to 5.7% and rivals the performance of a state-of-the-art combination system. Moreover, we show that the discourse relations it predicts for sentence pairs exhibit considerable overlap with relations identified by human annotators. \n\nIn contrast to a generic discourse analyzer, our method can also utilize additional information available in the machine comprehension context. For instance, question types provide valuable cues for determining discourse relations, and thus can facilitate learning.", "scores": {"ppl": 65.19389343261719, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -3.583995509147644, "acc": 0.0}}}
{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Basketball is a high-scoring game that requires speed, agility, and strategic thinking from players. Offensive players typically drive straight to the hoop and go for a lay-up or make a jump shot immediately during a fast break, with little time to stop and line up their shot. When a player goes straight from running into making a jump shot in one fluid motion without any pause, this is called a 'pull-up jumper', which requires seamless coordination and control. This skill involves dribbling at a fast jog or run down the middle of the court, maintaining control and balance as you move. Once mastered, this skill is a valuable one, as it allows you to make shots from virtually anywhere around the basket without giving the defense any time to react, making you a formidable opponent on the court. To make a pull-up jumper, start by dribbling at a fast jog or run down the middle of the court, maintaining control and balance as you move. As you near the free throw line, flare out a few feet to the side, creating space and keeping your opponent off balance. Come to a balanced stop in rhythm with your steps as you bring the ball up into both hands, preparing for the shot. Without hesitating, immediately get low, jump, and shoot, using the momentum from your dribble to propel you upward. Practice until you can pull this move off quickly without stopping at any point, developing muscle memory and confidence in your abilities. What do you do when you get the ball off of a pass and a defender is immediately right behind you, blocking your path to the hoop? One way to get out of this situation is to use a technique called a turnaround shot, which can be a game-changer in tight spaces. In a turnaround shot, the player with the ball pretends to go one way, then spins in the opposite direction and shoots as soon as they're facing the hoop, creating a small window of opportunity. Most of the time, this will give the player with the ball a small window during which he can shoot without the defender blocking him, making it a valuable asset in any player's arsenal. To shoot a turnaround shot, start with your back to the hoop and a defender guarding you closely from behind, using your body to shield the ball and create space. Back towards the hoop as you dribble and stay low until you're a comfortable shooting distance away from it, keeping your opponent off balance and guessing. Take a step in the direction of your throwing hand as you drop your non-shooting foot back slightly, transferring your weight and creating a stable base. Quickly pivot around on your non-shooting foot and make your jump shot immediately, using the momentum from your pivot to propel you upward. Many of the NBA's all-time greatest players had masterful fadeaway jump shots, a testament to their skill and technique, which often left defenders struggling to keep up with the shooter. As their name hints at, fadeaway shots are jump shots made when a player jumps and leans backward, bringing the ball away from the defender and creating extra room to shoot. This technique brings the ball away from the defender, giving the shooter extra room to shoot and making the shot very tough to guard against, making it a valuable asset in any player's arsenal. However, it can be very hard to make fadeaway shots, so they're often seen as the mark of an excellent (or selfish) player, requiring a combination of skill, technique, and confidence. To make a fadeaway, start with an ordinary jump shot or a turnaround shot as you normally would, using your momentum to propel you upward and backward. As you jump, push yourself upward and backward, putting space between yourself and the player behind you, creating a small window of opportunity. Lean back with your spine for extra space, using your body to shield the ball and create a stable base. Square up with the hoop in the air and hold the ball just above your head, using your arms to guide the ball and create a smooth shooting motion. When you reach the highest point of your jump, shoot the ball with a snapping motion of the wrist, using your wrist strength to propel the ball forward. Note that fadeaways require much more wrist strength than ordinary shots because much of the power from the legs that would ordinarily be used for the shot is spent propelling the shooter backwards. An important part of having a great jump shot is knowing when not to shoot, and using your opponent's aggression against them. By carefully interspersing your shots with the occasional fakeout, you can keep defenders on their toes, creating uncertainty and confusion. More importantly, however, is the fact that a convincing fake can open up shooting opportunities when you're being guarded by a defender that just won't leave you alone, making it a valuable asset in any player's arsenal. To make a pump fake, get low as you normally would just before taking a shot, using your body to shield the ball and create space. Bring the ball up in front of you and prepare to jump, using your momentum to propel you upward. Start to rise up, but stop yourself just short of actually jumping, creating a sense of uncertainty and confusion in your opponent.", "scores": {"ppl": 25.505369186401367, "some": 0.8732158342997233, "bart": -1.2801096439361572, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "I was smitten when I first met my ex, convinced she was the one I had been searching for.

Those closest to us, such as family and intimate friends, are often the easiest to trust and deceive, which can lead to the most devastating and heart-wrenching betrayals that can leave long-lasting emotional scars. Recently, my grandfather suffered a devastating stroke that left him with severely impaired motor skills and a rapidly fading memory, forcing him to rely on others for care, support, and daily necessities. The incident may have had a profound impact on him, but he remains a cherished and beloved individual with a lifetime of love, sacrifices, and cherished memories to his name. My grandmother, who has been married to him for over fifty years, displayed no empathy or love; instead, she harbored an intense and unrelenting hatred for her husband, fueled by her own deep-seated hurt, anger, and resentment. She had zero admiration or affection for her husband, but an unrelenting and all-consuming loathing for him, fueled by her own hurt, anger, and deep-seated resentment that seemed to consume her entire being. My family's actions have rendered him a helpless, state-owned individual, stripped of his dignity, autonomy, and basic human rights, and left to suffer in a cold, unforgiving, and often bleak environment. My grandmother has publicly denounced my grandfather for cashing out a life insurance policy in the 1980s for $5000, a betrayal that has left her consumed by resentment and a deep-seated anger that still simmers to this day. He had given them everything he possibly could, but it was all undone by the lies my grandmother told, which allowed her to have him committed to a psychiatric ward, a place he never should have been, and a fate that has left him with a lifetime of emotional scars. This institution is notorious for housing the criminally insane, and it's a cruel and devastating irony that a veteran has been reduced to this state, where he's forced to live alongside those who have committed heinous crimes and unspeakable atrocities. My grandmother has made arrangements for his body to be donated to science after his passing, a callous gesture that has left the family speechless, heartbroken, and reeling in shock. A week ago, my mother informed me that my grandmother claimed my grandfather had clinically died, only to be revived, leaving him abandoned, alone, and ailing in a foreign and unfamiliar environment, where he's surrounded by strangers who don't care or understand his plight. He is abandoned, a frail and sick man, left to suffer in a desolate and often bleak place, with no one to care for him, show him compassion, or provide him with the love and support he so desperately needs. I am heartbroken and devastated by the situation, feeling helpless and powerless to change the course of events, and unable to find any sense of peace or solace in a world that seems to have turned against him. The people we trust most can often be the ones to betray us, causing irreparable harm and leaving us to pick up the pieces of our shattered lives and try to move forward with a sense of dignity and resilience. The situation is a stark reminder of the dangers of false accusations and the importance of protecting oneself with advanced directives and wills, to prevent a similar fate from befalling them and to ensure their wishes are respected and their legacy is protected. This reality is a sobering reminder that it's impossible to discern who can be truly trusted, and that even the closest relationships can be built on lies, deception, and a deep-seated lack of understanding and empathy.

To avoid overburdening one person with snack responsibilities, task each group leader to bring food and drink for their session. Opt for finger foods that are high in protein and low in grease, such as fruits, veggies, nuts, cheese, hummus, or pretzels. Pizza works in a pinch for a late-night study session, but keep in mind it's greasy and may leave you feeling full and tired instead of alert and focused. The group leaders should create a detailed plan for each study session, including a clear outline of topics to be covered and a schedule for breaks, to keep everyone on track. What's essential is that everyone in the group has a general outline of the topics that will be covered and in what order to stay focused. This will help keep everyone on task, as they'll know what they need to cover and can focus on those topics. The group leaders should determine the agenda structure, deciding what makes the most sense for covering the topics of the day, taking into account the needs and preferences of the group. For a math class, for instance, you might spend two-thirds of the time on homework problems and one-third on concepts, but for a history class, you'd probably spend more time discussing main ideas. If your study session is longer than 45 minutes, schedule in breaks for stretching, using the restroom, checking your phone, or just chatting, to help maintain focus and productivity. Giving intermittent breaks helps keep everyone on task, as they provide a scheduled opportunity to take a break and recharge. The break schedule should be included in the agenda for the day, along with any other relevant details. Decide together as a group what works best, considering the needs and preferences of all group members. Some people prefer to work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break, while others may prefer different work-to-break ratios. It doesn't really matter, as long as everyone agrees and is comfortable with the chosen approach. There are many websites available that offer ideas and strategies for effective studying, including interactive approaches and group activities. Given the group's diversity, it's crucial to be open to experimenting with various study methods to ensure everyone can benefit. Additionally, allow time for group members to ask questions and clarify any material they may still be unclear about. People learn in different ways, so it's essential to offer a range of study methods and approaches to cater to different learning styles. Some proven study methods include teaching each other the materials, having debates, watching and discussing film clips, playing trivia games, quizzing one another, and other interactive approaches.

These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual transfer and numerous multilingual NLP tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Pires et al., 2019), which is a testament to their impressive ability to handle diverse languages and tasks. However, it is essential to note that a real-world system will inevitably encounter real-world noise, including linguistic variations and common errors observed in textual data, which are often absent from benchmark datasets. This issue of robustness in multilingual settings has been largely overlooked, with prior works primarily focusing on monolingual settings (Peng et al., 2021; Sengupta et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020). Consequently, investigation has been scarce in the area of multilingual robustness, highlighting the need for further research in this domain.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the effect of realistic noise in multilingual settings and propose novel methods to boost the robustness of multilingual language models across four NLP tasks: Intent Classification (IC), Slot Labeling (SL), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Due to the lack of multilingual noisy evaluation data, we synthesize benchmarks by mining noise from publicly available corpora and injecting them into the test sets associated with each of the four tasks. To ensure that this noised data is indeed realistic, we conduct human validation and analyze the variety of noise-types seen across languages (in \u00a73). Our analyses highlight the potential of our testset in evaluating and motivating future research on multilingual robustness.\n\nTo benchmark the performance of multilingual systems, we consider accuracy metrics on two utterance-level tasks (IC% and NLI%) and F1-scores on two token-level classification tasks (SL-F1 and NER-F1). We specifically seek to evaluate the model's performance on the noised version of the test datasets in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting, where we have training data available only in one language (in our case, English) and test-data in various languages (Liu et al., 2019, 2020). While training data augmentation increases model robustness for monolingual (i.e. English) settings, it is not immediately obvious if these robustness gains can transfer across languages, as error types can often be language-specific. For example, typos in Devanagari script can differ from those seen in Latin scripts (e.g. (cid:45)(cid:107)(cid:1) (cid:108) \u2192 (cid:115)(cid:107)u(cid:108) in Devanagari showcases that a joined character is incorrectly separated into two characters in the word 'school').\n\nThus, to improve the robustness of pretrained multilingual models across noise in all languages, we propose Robust Contrastive Pretraining (RCP) that couples multilingual noisy data-augmentation with a contrastive learning loss term during pretraining; this encourages the model to develop similar representations for the original and the noised version of a sentence. Our method is designed to be effective in a variety of multilingual settings and can be easily integrated into existing pretraining pipelines. On the noisy test sets, our method improves the multilingual model performance across all metrics and multilingual tasks \u2013 IC% by 4.9% on MultiATIS++, 4.1% on MultiSNIPS; SL-F1 by 18.4 on MultiATIS++, 8.6 on MultiSNIPS; NER-F1 by 2.9 on WikiANN; NLI% by 0.7% on XNLI. In summary, our primary contributions are:\n\n* We propose a novel method for improving the robustness of multilingual language models in the presence of realistic noise.\n* We synthesize multilingual noisy evaluation data by mining noise from publicly available corpora and injecting them into the test sets associated with each of the four tasks.\n* We conduct human validation to ensure that this noised data is indeed realistic and analyze the variety of noise-types seen across languages.\n* We evaluate the performance of multilingual models on the noised version of the test datasets in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting.\n* We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the robustness of multilingual language models across all metrics and multilingual tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, our work highlights the importance of robustness in multilingual NLP settings and proposes a novel method for improving the robustness of multilingual language models. We believe that our work has the potential to significantly impact the development of real-world multilingual NLP systems and look forward to future research in this domain.", "scores": {"ppl": 33.2209587097168, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.841639041900635, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}

If you cannot eat huge meals due to stomach issues, eat smaller meals throughout the day. Avoid skipping meals altogether. \n\nEating frequently throughout the day provides a steady flow of calories. Try to eat at least every 4 hours, whether it's one of your meals or a small snack. If you're not up to a meal, have a snack that includes protein and at least three different types of food.\n\nIf you prefer, you can divide your day into 4-6 smaller meals instead of adding snacks between larger meals. For instance, try a piece of whole grain bread with banana and peanut butter or some celery with hummus and feta cheese.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Fears about what other people think of you can feel overwhelming when they're big and vague, and they can be difficult to manage because of their broad nature. Identifying the specific concerns causing you anxiety is essential to effectively address these fears, such as the fear of being judged by your boss or coworkers. Breaking down your anxieties into more specific worries will not only make them feel less overwhelming, but it will also enable you to develop a tailored strategy for dealing with them. This can involve creating a to-do list, setting realistic goals, or even using time-blocking to prioritize your tasks, which can help you stay organized and focused. For example, you may have a general fear of people judging you at work, such as your boss not thinking you're productive enough, or your coworker gossiping about you, which can be a significant concern in a fast-paced corporate environment like finance, law, or a high-stakes job where mistakes can have severe consequences, but also in industries where creativity and self-expression are valued, such as art or design. However, the specific scenario of your boss not thinking you're productive enough might be a legitimate concern if you work in a conservative industry where appearance matters, such as finance or law. It could also be a concern if you're in a high-stakes job where appearance matters, such as a surgeon or a pilot, or in a job where you're constantly under scrutiny, such as a public figure or a politician. To pinpoint your concerns more specifically, try to identify the source of your worries, such as whether your boss's perception of you is influenced by your tattoos, your age, your background, or if you're simply feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to meet deadlines. You might also want to consider what specific situations or interactions trigger your anxiety, and whether there are any common themes or patterns emerging. You may also find that your concerns are unfounded, such as the fear that people at your job will judge you because of your tattoos, which is unlikely to be a concern if you work in an easy-going coffee shop where everyone wears body art and the atmosphere is relaxed, or in a startup environment where creativity and self-expression are encouraged. Being mindful means being more aware of your surroundings, thoughts, and feelings at any given moment. This can help you feel more grounded and focused on the present moment by allowing you to recognize when your worries are spiraling out of control. Mindfulness involves paying attention to the sensations in your body, the rhythm of your breath, and the thoughts passing through your mind without judgment or attachment. Making an effort to be mindful can help you recognize and manage your anxiety more easily by gently steering your thoughts back to the here and now. This can be done through regular mindfulness practice, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, or by incorporating mindfulness into your daily activities, such as eating or walking. By being more present and aware, you can reduce feelings of anxiety and increase feelings of calm and confidence. One way to practice mindfulness meditation is by using an app that guides you through the process, or by finding guided meditation exercises online, such as a 10-minute body scan or a 20-minute loving-kindness exercise. You can also try simply paying attention to your breath, noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, or focusing on a physical sensation in your body, such as the feeling of your feet on the ground. For example, you might find yourself repeatedly thinking, \"I'm going to mess up my part of this group project, and then the other students in my group will hate me,\" which can be a daunting thought to confront. Even if this thought is persistent, try to challenge it and reframe it in a more realistic or positive light, such as \"I've prepared well for this project and I'm capable of doing a great job.\" Even if the only solution you can think of is something simple, like \"I would apologize for messing up,\" that's still a start, and it's essential to take action and address the situation rather than letting anxiety consume you. Taking action can be as simple as talking to your group members, seeking help from a teacher or mentor, or taking a step back to reassess your priorities and goals. One great way to take your mind off of what other people are thinking is to do something productive, such as finishing a chore or project you've been putting off, volunteering for a cause you support, or going out of your way to do something kind for someone, like a neighbor who could use some help with their yard work. You might also try engaging in a creative activity, such as painting or writing, or practicing a hobby, such as gardening or cooking. Getting busy with an important task will keep you focused on what you are doing, rather than on how others are (or might be) judging you, which can lead to increased feelings of productivity and satisfaction. This can be especially true if the task is something you enjoy or find meaningful, such as working on a passion project or helping someone in need. For instance, you might finish a chore or project you've been putting off, volunteer for a cause you support, or help a neighbor with something they need, such as running errands or helping with their grocery shopping.

If you hold an open account of any type with a bank, they will cash a valid check for you, provided you meet the bank's identification and verification requirements, which may include providing a valid government-issued ID, proof of address, and account information, and note that identification requirements can vary between banks and may include requirements for a valid government-issued ID, proof of address, and account information. However, when cashing a check in person, you may need to show a valid photo ID to the bank teller, who will verify your identity and account information in a few minutes. Driver\u2019s licenses and passports are usually the best choices for identification when cashing a check, as they contain essential personal and security information, including your name, date of birth, and photo, with date of birth being a critical piece of information. In some cases, military or school identification documents may be accepted as proof of identity by your bank, but it's best to check with them beforehand. Many banks prefer that you have your debit card with you when cashing a check, which can be used to verify your account information and confirm the check's validity, making the process faster and more efficient. If you don't have your debit card, you may need to fill out additional forms, which can take more time and involve extra verification processes, such as phone or video verification. Contact your bank branch with any questions about their identification requirements or verification processes, as these may vary between banks and branches, and they can provide more information on specific requirements, including any required verification processes. You won\u2019t need to show a photo ID if you cash the check at an ATM or via your smartphone, as transactions are typically processed without the need for identification. This is the easiest method for getting the money you've earned quickly and safely, without the need for in-person verification or identification, and it's often available 24/7. Show the teller your ID, or hand them your debit card, and follow their instructions to complete the transaction. Never sign the back of the check before arriving at the bank, as this can make it easier for someone to cash the check without your permission, and instead, sign it in front of the teller for ultimate security. Some banks may require you to deposit the check to your account rather than cash it, which can be a better option if you need the funds immediately, provided you have sufficient funds in your account, and note that this may be more likely if the check is drawn on an account from another bank. If you need cash right away and already have sufficient funds in your account, you can deposit the check and then immediately withdraw the amount you need using your debit card or other accepted methods.

Banks will typically charge a fee for dealing with a returned check, which can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, depending on the bank's policies and procedures. Modern ATMs make it easy to deposit paper checks to your account, using the machine's deposit slot and following the on-screen instructions.

If you already have sufficient funds in your account, you can withdraw the amount you need in the meantime and then deposit the check to your account when it clears. To deposit a check at an ATM, insert your debit card, type in your PIN, select \"Deposit Check,\" insert the check into the check deposit slot, confirm the amount, and then withdraw the money you need, following the on-screen instructions. Many banks now offer mobile deposit services, allowing you to deposit checks using your smartphone, which can be a convenient and secure option, especially with a mobile banking app. The process may vary between banks, but it typically involves downloading the app, taking a photo of your check, and following the on-screen instructions to deposit the check to your account. To deposit a check using your smartphone, endorse the check and take clear and well-lit photos of its front and back sides, making sure all relevant information is visible and legible, including the check number, date, and amount.

The size of these models has been steadily growing to hundreds of millions (Devlin et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019) to billions of parameters (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).

Knowledge distillation has been proposed as a solution to compress large-scale models, with several research directions considered, including pruning (Gordon et al., 2020), quantization (Han et al., 2016), and distillation (Sanh, 2019). Knowledge distillation involves training a student network to mimic the full output distribution of a teacher network (Hinton et al., 2015). We train a student network with smaller capacity to mimic the teacher network.\n\nWe apply knowledge distillation to pre-trained language model compression in two settings: task-agnostic distillation and task-specific distillation. Task-agnostic distillation has the advantage of allowing the model to be reused for fine-tuning on multiple downstream tasks (Sanh, 2019; Sun et al., 2019, 2020). On the other hand, task-specific distillation has been shown to achieve significantly higher compression rate and inference speedup (Tang et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2019; Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020). In this work, we study the transferability of pre-trained models across several source tasks to select the optimal one for transfer.\n\nWe aim to create universally distilled models that can be used with any downstream task while leveraging the benefits of the techniques and augmentation resources developed for the source transfer task.

This issue is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where varying literacy levels and high phone ownership costs exacerbate the problem (Ranjan, 2022). Many of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) are documented on support websites with step-by-step instructions that describe what users should do on the UI. We aim to harness these help documents to create step-by-step tutorials overlaid on the phone's UI.\n\nTo achieve this, we need several natural language processing (NLP) components, including retrieval, parsing, and grounding. However, no relevant dataset exists for this task in a multilingual setting. We build upon prior work in the NLP community (Li et al., 2020a) and extend it to include multilingual and multimodal directions. To evaluate our approach, we collect a new multi-lingual, multi-modal UI grounded dataset called UGIF-DataSet.\n\nThis dataset consists of 523 how-to queries per language, along with step-by-step instructions in English and a sequence of UI screenshots and actions that demonstrate how to complete the task. Each query and UI sequence is available in 8 languages. Our data release focuses on retrieval, parsing, and instruction following in Android, which should be of interest to the NLP community.\n\nA significant challenge arises from the fact that many smartphone users are bilingual or multilingual and frequently use non-English languages. They ask queries in their native language, but the help documents are often available only in English. This necessitates cross-modal, cross-lingual retrieval. Furthermore, users may use a different UI/system language, and app developers do not always provide translations for every UI element, resulting in some UI elements in English and the rest in the chosen system language.\n\nTo address this, we propose an initial approach that splits the task into retrieval, parsing, and grounding. When a user utters a query, the matching FAQ page is retrieved from the support site using an off-the-shelf speech recognizer and a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) to find the closest matching how-to question in the help document corpus.\n\nThe step-by-step instructions in the help document are parsed using a large language model (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to generate macros such as tap(), toggle(), home(), etc. This macro sequence is used to create a tutorial on-device by grounding each macro in the UI using a multi-lingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) to find the closest matching UI element.\n\nOur contributions include releasing UGIF-DataSet, a new multilingual, multi-modal dataset of how-to queries and sequences of UI screens and actions performed by human annotators. This is the first such multi-modal dataset of its kind. We also evaluate parsing of step-by-step how-to instructions with large language models and UI grounding with multi-lingual BERT sentence embedding (LaBSE).\n\nOur results indicate that there is considerable room to improve performance, especially in non-English languages.

Recently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been proposed by pretraining Transformer models over massive, web-scaled corpora, showcasing remarkable capabilities in solving a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, while also enabling the development of more sophisticated language generation and conversational AI systems, which have transformed the field of NLP and opened up new possibilities for natural language processing, and have been widely adopted in various industries, such as customer service, healthcare, and finance, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of language-based tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to a substantial increase in model capacity, they further investigate the scaling effect by increasing the parameter scale to even larger sizes, which has been shown to yield significant improvements in model performance and the ability to learn complex language representations, enabling models to capture subtle nuances in language and understand context-dependent relationships, and have implications for the development of more advanced NLP models that can handle complex and nuanced language tasks. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a substantial performance improvement but also exhibit some special abilities, such as inductive reasoning, contextual understanding, and the capacity to generate coherent and informative responses, that are not present in small-scale language models like BERT, and are crucial for tasks that require a deep understanding of language and context, and have been shown to outperform smaller models in various benchmarks and evaluations. To discriminate the language models in different parameter scales, the research community has coined the term Large Language Models (LLMs) for the PLMs of significant size, typically tens or even hundreds of billions of parameters, which are capable of understanding intricate linguistic patterns and responding coherently to complex queries, and have become a cornerstone of modern NLP research and applications, and are being used in various industries to improve the accuracy and efficiency of language-based tasks. In the vast and rapidly evolving world of computer language processing, a revolutionary entity has emerged, Large Language Models (LLMs), which possess the remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like language, adapt to new contexts, and learn from vast amounts of text data, enabling a wide range of applications in language translation, text summarization, and conversational AI, and have the potential to transform the way we interact with computers and access information, and have been shown to have a significant impact on various industries, such as education, healthcare, and customer service. These models possess the remarkable ability to understand intricate linguistic patterns, recognize subtle nuances in language, and respond coherently, matching the context and intent of the input, while also exhibiting a high degree of creativity and the capacity to generate novel and informative content, which is essential for tasks that require a deep understanding of language and context, and have been shown to have a significant impact on various industries, such as content creation, marketing, and customer service. LLMs are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that serve as powerful tools for various tasks, including machine translation, question answering, content generation, and text summarization, offering significant benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and the ability to process and understand vast amounts of language data, and have become an essential component of modern AI research and applications, and are being used in various industries to improve the accuracy and efficiency of language-based tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and access information. One notable example of LLMs is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, which is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture and was trained on a vast corpus of internet-sourced text data, including books, articles, wikis, and websites, enabling it to generate human-like responses and engage in conversations with users, and has become a benchmark for LLMs in terms of performance and capabilities, and has been shown to have a significant impact on various industries, such as customer service, healthcare, and education. In recent years, major research institutes and technology companies have increased their investment in the development of LLMs, resulting in a series of groundbreaking models with the potential for a wide range of applications, from language translation and text summarization to conversational AI and content generation, and have enabled the development of more sophisticated AI systems that can understand and generate human-like language, and have the potential to transform the way we interact with computers and access information, and have been shown to have a significant impact on various industries, such as education, healthcare, and customer service. The GPT family, including GPT-3 and GPT-4, has made significant advances in natural language generation, dialogue systems, and text comprehension, and is widely used in a variety of intelligent

Extensive analysis of Large Multimodal Models has been conducted by several studies, which have identified their various strengths and weaknesses. Recent works typically follow a common workflow involving model selection, specialized benchmark design, and evaluation. To test a model's capabilities, researchers must first select the appropriate model, then design a tailored benchmark to address their research question. A common workflow for recent works involves selecting models for testing, devising specialized benchmarks, and evaluating the models on these benchmarks. To perform this experimental evaluation, various considerations can arise, such as determining the number of colors to include in the test. The complexity of the color palette should also be considered to ensure that the test is comprehensive and informative. If a model shows proficiency with a specific set of colors, it may be necessary to continue with further examination to ensure that the results are conclusive. Designing benchmarks can be particularly complex, requiring significant domain expertise to ensure that the test is accurate and informative. Data collection and curation can be notoriously expensive, and the protocol design and result analyses can be bound to subjectivity.

Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, then hold your breath in for 7 seconds before exhaling slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat this process 3-5 times, paying attention to how your body relaxes with each breath. This is a simple yet effective technique to calm your mind and body. You can also try belly breathing to enhance the experience. Place your left hand on your belly and slowly inhale through your nose while keeping your chest still. As you breathe, allow your stomach to expand outward. Exhale slowly through your mouth, and push your belly inward to force the air out. Keep your mouth closed, but slightly apart to allow for a smooth exhalation. \n\nTo further relax, sit up straight and hum a low \"mmm\" sound in the back of your throat. Continue to inhale through your nose while maintaining the hum, and feel the vibrations spread through your face and chest. This exercise can help you release tension and feel more at ease. \n\nAdditionally, you can engage in activities that stimulate laughter. Laughter has been shown to have a profound impact on reducing stress and anxiety. If possible, watch a short, humorous video on YouTube, listen to your favorite comedian, or imagine a funny image in your mind. You can also try making light of a situation by creating ridiculous what-if scenarios that are unlikely to occur. For instance, if you're stressed about a job interview, you might ask yourself, \"What if the interviewer and I were wearing the exact same outfit?\" or \"What if the interviewer was a mime?\" \n\nClosing your eyes and imagining yourself in a peaceful environment can also be beneficial. Think about what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste in this setting to help you fully immerse yourself. It could be a serene desert island, a lush field of flowers, or any other place that brings you a sense of calm. As you visualize this scene, try to distract yourself from your current stress and anxiety.\n\nWhen you feel more relaxed, slowly open your eyes and notice how your body feels.

Such models are pre-trained on tasks like masked language modeling (MLM) and next-sentence prediction (NSP), and are intended to be task-agnostic, facilitating their transfer to new tasks. Extending such models to multiple languages is a natural next step, as evidenced by the recent proliferation of multilingual transformers. These follow from earlier work which sought to achieve transferable multilingual representations using recurrent network-based methods.\n\nThe considerable capacity of these multilingual models has motivated research into the nature of the representations learned during pretraining. It has been suggested that models like multilingual BERT (mBERT) acquire robust language-specific representations. However, models like mBERT also have language-neutral representations, which cut across linguistic distinctions and enable the model to handle aspects of meaning language-independently.\n\nThis allows the model to be fine-tuned on a monolingual labeled data set and achieve good results in other languages, a process known as cross-lingual zero-shot learning. Researchers have tried to disentangle the language-specific and language-neutral components of mBERT. This background provides the motivation for the work presented in this paper.\n\nWe focus on the relationship between language-specific and language-neutral representations in mBERT, and study the impact of fine-tuning on the balance between these two types of representations. We measure the effect of fine-tuning on mBERT's representations in the context of two different tasks - part-of-speech (POS) tagging and natural language inference (NLI). While NLI involves reasoning about deep semantic relations, POS tagging requires a model to bring to bear knowledge of a language's morphosyntactic features.\n\nWe hypothesize that mBERT needs to dedicate a greater share of its representational capacity to language-specific features for POS tagging compared to NLI. Our results show that mBERT accommodates language-specific and language-neutral representations to different degrees as a function of the task it is fine-tuned on. This is supported by results from language identification (LID) experiments.\n\nWe then consider two alternative strategies that force the model to 'unlearn' language-specific representations, via gradient reversal or iterative adversarial learning. However, these methods are shown not to further improve the language-independent component for cross-lingual transfer, over and above the effect of fine-tuning. Thus, we conclude that the reorganization of mBERT's representations that happens with fine-tuning is already taking on this role.\n\nOur main contributions are (a) to provide further support for the distinction between language-specific and language-neutral representation in mBERT; (b) to show that fine-tuning results in a reorganization of mBERT's representations; (c) to study two methods to enhance language-neutrality in mBERT; and (d) a new Wikipedia-based language identification data set.\n\nNote that our goal is not to improve mBERT's multilinguality but to acquire a better understanding of it, extending previous work along these lines.", "scores": {"ppl": 30.870845794677734, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.372936248779297, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

To address these issues, researchers have also looked at (Li et al., 2022) for further improvements. The figure compares the performance of MMT and Multilingual MMT in handling multiple language translations, specifically in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the results indicate a notable improvement in translation quality and speed. A possible solution to reduce computational costs is to use a single model to handle translations of multiple languages. This approach has been demonstrated in Figure 1(b) as an effective way to minimize resource utilization. A Multilingual MMT Model can handle translations for multiple languages, including En-De, En-Fr, and En-Cs. This capability is particularly important for applications that require simultaneous translation across different languages. To address the limitations of current methods, we propose the LVP-M3 method, a simple and effective approach that comprises three components. The three components are Token Encoding, Language-aware Visual Prompt Generation (LVPG), and Language Translation. We then utilize the transformer to encode textual tokens, as detailed in (Johnson et al., 2017). This encoding process is a crucial step in preparing the input data for the translation model. Specifically, for Multilingual MMT, an effective language-aware visual prompt generation strategy is proposed to produce tailored visual prompts for each target language. These prompts are designed to enhance the translation quality and accuracy. We establish two Multilingual MMT benchmark datasets to facilitate further research on Multilingual MMT. Our proposed LVP-M3 method has been successfully evaluated on these datasets, showcasing its effectiveness.

Various studies are being conducted in several domains, including intention classification, topic classification, sentiment analysis, and more (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong, 2019; Risch and Krestel, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Heo et al., 2021). The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has led to excellent performance in text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2020). However, Transformer-based deep learning models may suffer from underfitting due to the extensive model size compared to the training data size (Liu et al., 2019).\n\nTo overcome this issue, some studies have reported that artificially increasing the size of the data can improve performance in various tasks (Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In data-driven machine learning, collecting sufficient high-quality data is crucial for adequate model learning. However, such collection processes are not always viable, leading researchers to tackle this issue from the perspective of data augmentation using pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019; Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).\n\nThere are two main strategies for natural language data augmentation: (1) collecting data using human resources and (2) creating and modifying data mechanically or semi-automatically. The former guarantees data quality, but collecting and preprocessing large-scale data manually is extremely time-consuming and costly. Therefore, various automation strategies have been proposed to overcome such limitations.\n\nRepresentative approaches include data augmentation using a generation model or modifying a part of the text (Yu et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020). One study proposed a back-translation method using both directions of machine translation systems (Yu et al., 2018). However, semantic discrepancy can occur in round-trip translation to other languages, which may not guarantee the augmentation of natural and syntactically plausible sentences.\n\nIn the approach using text modification, data similar to the original text is augmented by using strategies such as replacing a specific word with a synonym, inserting a random word, changing the position of two random words in a sentence, or deleting a random word (Wei and Zou, 2019). Other studies investigated the effect of giving synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and hypernym, and using semantic text exchange (Feng et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, using a thesaurus such as WordNet or a part-of-speech tagger usually requires considerable time and budget.\n\nTo address the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, we propose a data augmentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation model and character order change (COC) strategy. Our methodology consists of three steps: (1) data augmentation with generation (DAG), (2) data augmentation with modification (DAM), and (3) data augmentation with generation and modification (DAGAM).\n\nOur methodology is a simple and easy strategy to automatically augment natural language data. We perform data augmentation on six benchmark datasets in the text classification task. To verify the power of our scheme, we use BERT, a representative Transformer-based pre-trained language model, for fine-tuning and evaluation. The utility of our methodology is verified by performance improvement made on all benchmark datasets, compared to the case with no augmentation.\n\nThe contribution of our work to the field is as follows:\n\n\u2022 We propose DAG, a data augmentation method using a generation model, DAM, a data augmentation method using character order changing (COC), and DAGAM, a combined scheme of two methods, verifying and comparing their utility through BERT-based fine-tuning and evaluation.\n\n\u2022 We provide a simple and easy-to-use data augmentation methodology that can be easily accessed by the community of industry and academia.\n\n\u2022 Our methodology can be used to augment natural language data in various tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.\n\n\u2022 Our results show that our methodology can improve the performance of text classification models, even when the size of the training data is limited.\n\n\u2022 Our methodology can be used to overcome the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, which may require considerable time and budget.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.338655471801758, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -5.139410972595215, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

For example, if you\u2019re stressed about a job interview, you may make yourself laugh by asking, \u201cWhat if the interviewer and I are wearing the exact same thing?\u201d or, \u201cWhat would I do if the interviewer was a mime?\u201d Close your eyes and imagine resting far away on a desert island, walking in a field of flowers, or going somewhere else that makes you feel calm, thinking about what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste there so you can picture yourself there better and distract yourself from how you\u2019re feeling right now. When you feel more relaxed, notice how your body feels, and picturing something like eating a comforting meal can also help you feel at ease. Try to remember a memory where you felt relaxed or excited to boost your mood even more. Keeping your mind on what you need to do rather than your stress will help pass time more quickly, start with the most complicated tasks first so you get them out of the way before working on the easier things, and do the best that you can so you know that you put your best foot forward, for example, if you are taking an exam, take your time, carefully comprehend each question and focus on what you already have studied and memorized, or if in a play, focus on the lines you have memorized, watch and listen carefully for your cue, get into your role, and pretend you really are that character. Everyone responds to stress differently, so if you get agitated or angry when you\u2019re stressed, take some time to relax first, or if you normally get spaced out or withdrawn, try to fight stress with a stimulating and energizing activity instead.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.85248374938965, "some": 0.8941826820373535, "bart": -0.6190049052238464, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Virtual assistants are independent contractors who provide administrative services to small businesses and offices.

Traditionally, business plans are broken down into these nine main sections: executive summary, company description, market analysis, organization and management, service or product line, marketing, funding, financial projections, and appendix. Be as detailed in your plan as possible by making a list of the owner's and employees' responsibilities, the types of services you'll provide, and what prices you intend to offer your products at, which is especially important when considering your company's description and market analysis. To maximize your chances of success in a competitive market, you'll need to determine what you can offer in your aquarium shop that customers in your area can't get from your competitors, such as unique products or services.

Never give children under the age of 18 aspirin, as this has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition that can cause brain damage and liver problems, leading to long-term health consequences, including cognitive difficulties, seizures, and even death. Use child-strength formulations when giving pain relievers to your child, and follow the dosing recommendations on the package or consult with your pediatrician.

Especially for individuals who are not particular about the make or model of their desired car, it is highly recommended to shop around and compare deals from different dealerships. Knowing your credit score and understanding how it affects your eligibility for different financing offers is crucial in making informed decisions. Typically, the best financing offers are reserved for prime borrowers with excellent credit, boasting credit scores in the 700s or higher. If you are planning to trade in an old car, look for dealerships that offer to double the price on a trade-in or provide a guaranteed minimum amount for any trade-in, regardless of its condition. When you have conducted thorough research, you will likely have a shortlist of dealerships that you would like to visit. Before visiting the dealership in person, it is advisable to evaluate their inventory online to get a sense of their current stock. When searching for the best car for your needs, considering the overall price of the vehicle is essential, rather than just focusing on the monthly payment amounts. Dealerships may advertise the monthly payment amounts instead of the total price, which can sometimes be a tactic to charge higher interest rates. It is also worth noting that dealerships typically finance any car on their lot, providing customers with a wider range of options to choose from, especially when compared to direct financing. However, this increased variety may not necessarily be beneficial, as it is still crucial to check the car's history and have it inspected before making a purchase. Cars depreciate in value over time, and when buying a used car, it is essential to finance as little of the total price as possible to minimize losses. A down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price of the car is typically sufficient to secure the best rates for financing. Making a sizable down payment can also help you avoid being underwater on your loan, which means owing more for the car than its current worth. This is particularly important when financing a used car, which can develop mechanical problems relatively quickly. To complete the financing application at the dealership, you will need to provide basic identification information as well as details about your income and employment. It may take a few minutes, but in most cases, the dealer will have a financing offer available for you that same day. Then, they will call you back into an office to discuss the terms you have been offered. The finance company may require additional documents from you, such as pay stubs to verify your income, so be sure to keep copies of these documents to avoid jeopardizing your financing offer. If the dealer mentions any of these requirements, make sure to get copies to the dealer as soon as possible to ensure that your financing offer remains intact. If you have done your research and know your credit score, you may be able to negotiate better terms from the dealer than what you were initially offered. It is essential to review each term carefully and see if you can improve it. For example, you typically want to opt for the shortest term loan, as it usually has the lowest interest rates. However, dealers often focus on the amount of the monthly payment, so be prepared to discuss the pros and cons of a shorter loan term. Financing for a shorter term does indeed mean a higher monthly payment, but it will save you money overall and help you pay off the loan more quickly. Dealerships tend to tack on extra fees, including sales tax, registration fees, and document or destination fees, which can add up quickly. You may also end up paying extra for dealer warranties, especially for a used car, so be sure to review these additional costs carefully. The dealer typically has no problem rolling these extra fees into your financing, but there's no point in paying interest on fees and tax, so try to pay these out of pocket if possible.", "scores": {"ppl": 20.76822853088379, "some": 0.876010020573934, "bart": -1.5206184387207031, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}
{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Text classification is a key downstream task of natural language processing. It involves classifying text into predefined categories. Since pre-trained language models emerged, Transformer-based deep learning models have shown exceptional performance for text classification, particularly in the works by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and Devlin et al. in 2019, as well as Yu et al. in 2019. However, Transformer-based models may suffer from underfitting due to their large size compared to the training data size, as noted by Liu et al. in 2019, which can lead to poor model generalization. Collecting high-quality data is crucial in machine learning but often challenging due to the large amounts of data required. As a result, many studies focus on data augmentation using pre-existing data, such as the work by Yu et al. in 2018. Two primary strategies are employed for natural language data augmentation: data collection and preprocessing using human resources or data creation or modification using mechanical or semi-automatic methods. The former involves collecting and preprocessing large-scale data manually, which is extremely time-consuming and costly due to the human labor involved. The latter involves creating and modifying data mechanically or semi-automatically using various algorithms and tools. To overcome such limitations, several automation strategies have been proposed in the field of data augmentation. Data is augmented by using a generation model or modifying a part of the text, as demonstrated by Yu et al. in 2018. Yu et al. proposed a back-translation method using both directions of machine translation systems in 2018 to augment natural language data. However, semantic discrepancies can occur in round-trip translations to other languages, which may not guarantee augmented natural and syntactically plausible sentences. In the text modification approach, data is augmented by using strategies such as replacing a specific word with a synonym or inserting a random word. This was demonstrated by Wei and Zou in 2019, who showed the effectiveness of this approach in improving text classification performance. Other studies have also investigated the effect of giving synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponym and hypernym, and using semantic text exchange, as shown by Feng et al. in 2019 and 2020. Using a thesaurus like WordNet can be time-consuming and costly due to the complexity of the task. To address these limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation model and a character order change (COC) strategy. Our methodology consists of three steps: data augmentation using a generation model, COC, and combining the two methods for better results. Our methodology is a simple strategy to automatically augment natural language data without requiring extensive human effort. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology by performing data augmentation on six benchmark datasets in the text classification task using BERT. The utility of our methodology is verified by the performance improvements achieved on all benchmark datasets compared to the case with no augmentation, demonstrating its value in real-world applications. Our goal is to provide the community with easy access to effective data augmentation methodologies to improve text classification performance. To achieve this, we designed our methodology to be simple and efficient, reducing the need for extensive human resources. We believe that our methodology can be easily integrated into existing natural language processing pipelines to improve their performance. By providing a simple and effective data augmentation methodology, we aim to facilitate the development of high-performing text classification models. Our methodology can be applied to various natural language processing tasks beyond text classification, including sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. We envision our methodology being used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to language translation systems and text summarization tools. Our goal is not only to improve the performance of text classification models but also to make them more accessible and usable by a broader audience. To achieve this, we plan to make our methodology publicly available and easily integratable into existing natural language processing pipelines.

The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT has significantly improved text classification performance (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2020). However, large models may lead to underfitting due to small training datasets (Liu et al., 2019). Some studies suggest that artificially increasing the size of the training data can improve performance (Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).\n\nData-driven machine learning relies heavily on high-quality data. However, collecting sufficient data is not always feasible, and many studies tackle this issue by using pre-existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019; Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).

To prevent skunks from taking up residence under your structures, seal off any open areas with chicken wire fencing, which should be installed by digging a trench and placing the wire mesh along the bottom to prevent the skunks from digging underneath, as they often do when searching for food or shelter. To keep skunks from digging or squeezing under the chicken wire, ensure it extends at least 1 foot (30 cm) under the ground, taking into account the skunk's propensity for digging and its ability to squeeze through narrow openings when searching for food or shelter. If there's already a skunk living under your deck or another structure on your property, it's crucial to scare it out before sealing the area off, as attempting to seal the area with the skunk still present may lead to an unpleasant confrontation. Try encouraging the skunk to leave by setting up a bright light or an ultrasonic deterrent to frighten it away, as these devices can be effective in scaring skunks due to their sensitivity to light and sound, which can be particularly useful in deterring them from areas where they're not wanted. Before setting up any deterrents, wait until you're pretty sure the skunk is away from its den, as attempting to scare it out while it's still in its den may be challenging and potentially unsuccessful. If you have a backyard shed, garage, or other outbuilding that a skunk can easily wander into, close it up and secure any possible entrances, as skunks may seek shelter or food in these areas, which can lead to property damage and unpleasant odors. Otherwise, skunks may come in to seek shelter or look for food, highlighting the importance of securing outbuildings and removing any potential attractants that may draw skunks to these areas. Check for holes or gaps that a skunk could get into and seal them off with wire mesh or another suitable material, such as cement or plaster, to prevent skunks from entering your home or outbuildings through these openings. Piles of debris make tempting shelters for skunks, who are drawn to these areas due to the perceived safety and potential food sources they offer. If you suspect you have a skunk in your yard, clear away any large piles of rocks, sticks, wood, junk, or lawn waste that it could be hiding under, as these areas can be attractive to skunks and provide them with shelter and potential food sources. If you keep a firewood pile in your yard and are concerned about skunks denning under it, try putting a fence around it or spraying the area with a skunk deterrent, such as a castor oil spray or a commercial skunk repellent, to prevent them from taking up residence in this area. You can also store cut lumber or firewood in a closed shed or other outbuilding, if you have one, which can help prevent skunks from denning under the firewood pile. If you find a suspected skunk den, loosely fill the hole with a light material, such as dead leaves, straw, crumpled paper, or dirt, allowing the skunk to push its way out if it's occupied. If the den is occupied, the skunk will be able to push its way out, and if the material remains undisturbed for 2-3 days, you can assume the den is unoccupied and seal it off more permanently, e.g., by blocking it off with wire. If the den is still occupied, one option is to install a 1-way door at the entrance to the den, which will allow the skunk to leave but not re-enter, providing a humane solution to the problem. This device works by allowing the skunk to leave the den, but once it has exited, it will not be able to re-enter, making it an effective solution for preventing further skunk activity. You can buy 1-way animal doors online or from many home or garden supply stores, providing a convenient solution for humanely excluding skunks from your property. You can also try scaring any current occupants out of the den with a natural repellent or a sound or light deterrent, which can be effective in scaring skunks due to their sensitivity to these stimuli. Skunks are a major barnyard pest due to their tendency to raid chicken coops and eat the eggs, which can lead to significant losses for farmers and backyard chicken enthusiasts. If you keep chickens or other livestock that skunks might be interested in, secure the area by putting wire fencing around the coop, which should extend at least 8 inches (20 cm) under the ground to prevent skunks from digging underneath. Make sure the wire extends at least 8 inches (20 cm) under the ground around the coop, and ideally, it should also extend horizontally away from the enclosure another 8 inches (20 cm), so that it forms an L shape, providing a more comprehensive barrier against skunk invasion. Skunks also like to eat bees and their larvae, which can be a problem for beekeepers who rely on these insects for honey production and other purposes. If you keep bees, keep the hives elevated so that skunks can't easily reach them, providing an added layer of protection against skunk activity. Skunks like to den under bushes and shrubs, which provide them with shelter and potential food sources, highlighting the importance of managing these areas to prevent skunk activity. If you have any plants in your yard with low-hanging branches, prune them back so they don't offer as much shelter, making it more difficult for skunks to find a place to den.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "For years, I played bass in a fairly popular band that toured around the world but stopped a few years ago. In July, the band reunited and traveled to Bogota, Colombia to play a show. It was a surreal experience to reunite and work with the other members after all the time off, filled with moments of nostalgia and excitement as we fell back into our old rhythms. We were amused to see how quickly we all settled into our old behaviors, but it was also a relief to find that some things didn't change. Traveling as a group can be stressful, especially when you have to transport instruments that the TSA views with suspicion and attempts to disassemble, a frustrating experience I endured myself. Thankfully, I was able to get everything working for the concert, thanks to the help of some friendly TSA agents who guided me through the process. We had a full day in Bogota before the show, which we spent experiencing the vibrant city with a promoter we had worked with before on a previous trip. He took us to local restaurants and record stores we never would have stumbled upon by ourselves. That evening, there was a party at a trendy record store in a hipster area of town. After that, we headed to a small jazz club, where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing a captivating set. The club had a unique decor, featuring a prominently displayed triptych of the infamous chairman's image. Bogota is a city with a thriving arts scene, boasting very good painters and elaborate murals, as well as graffiti that approaches high art. The show was a double bill with another band, but unfortunately, it was underattended, with only a small crowd in the 5000-seat auditorium. Even though the whole organization was very professionally run, sound check seemed to last forever, leaving me unable to have lunch with an old friend I hadn't seen for years. However, the concert itself went well, with a strong attendance on the ground floor seats, but the balconies remained unused. Afterwards, I was able to meet up with my friend and enjoy some drinks together, reminiscing about old times. The day after the show was spent in the studio collaborating with the band we had shared the bill with, an enjoyable experience that felt like a mix of work and social occasion. Some friends of the other band, who are foodie types, prepared a meal for everyone, accompanied by plenty of beer and wine and general frivolity. Our last day in Bogota was open, so the guitarist, keyboardist, and I went to the National museum, a sprawling, long and narrow building with interactive exhibits on everything about Colombian culture. Afterwards, we had lunch at a Peruvian restaurant, which served some of the best food we had in Colombia. That was followed by lots of walking through flea markets and street fairs that spring up during the weekend, a delightful experience we thoroughly enjoyed. Then it was time to make our way to the airport for our red eye flight back to New York, a bittersweet moment of closure to our adventure.", "scores": {"ppl": 28.765291213989258, "some": 0.8203765081636832, "bart": -1.3633884462443264, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Virtual assistants are independent contractors who perform administrative services for businesses and offices.

The whole idea of bohemian style is all about a relaxed, effortless look. Long maxi skirts or peasant skirts are great options. Anything that makes you feel light and comfortable in layers, like a lightweight tank top or a flowy sundress, is a good choice. Look for flowing dresses that you can layer other pieces over or under to get an effortless look. Focus on layering at the top of your body. Instead, you want the look to draw attention to your face, and if you do a lot of layering on the bottom, you will draw attention downwards, creating a heavy look. You can wear everything loosely fitted, but if you prefer, you can also throw in fitted pieces. For example, if you are wearing a very flowy tunic, you might then put on a pair of tight leggings, which will give you a bit of shape while also emphasizing the flowy shirt. You create a relaxed, free-spirited look by layering clothes over each other, much like the traveling hippies and free-spirited adventurers who inspired the bohemian style. This flexibility is a key feature of bohemian style.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, encompassing various domains and research efforts. The text classification task is closely associated with other areas, including intention classification, topic classification, and sentiment analysis, which share common challenges and methodologies. Recent studies have explored connections between text classification and other domains, such as Jang et al. in 2019, Kim and Jeong in 2019, Risch and Krestel in 2019, Li et al. in 2020, and Heo et al. in 2021. BERT has been successfully applied to various text classification tasks, as shown by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and Yu et al. in 2019. Additionally, Devlin et al. in 2019, Guo et al. in 2020, and Shaheen et al. in 2020 demonstrated its effectiveness in this area. However, using Transformer-based deep learning models may lead to underfitting due to their size compared to the training data, as observed by Liu et al. in 2019. Increasing the size of the training data is a common approach to improve performance in various tasks, including text classification, as demonstrated by Liu et al. in 2019 and Brown et al. in 2020. Data collection is a vital but labor-intensive and costly process in machine learning. Data augmentation using pre-existing data has become a popular strategy due to its efficiency and effectiveness, as shown by Yu et al. in 2018, Wei and Zou in 2019, Feng et al. in 2019, Shorten and Khoshgoftaar in 2019, and Xie et al. in 2020. Data augmentation can be achieved through generation models or text modification, such as replacing words with synonyms or inserting random words, as demonstrated by Yu et al. in 2018, Shorten and Khoshgoftaar in 2019, and Xie et al. in 2020. One approach to data augmentation is back-translation, as proposed by Yu et al. in 2018, which translates an English sentence into another language and then back to English. However, this method may not guarantee the augmentation of natural and syntactically plausible sentences due to potential semantic discrepancies. Another approach to data augmentation is text modification, which involves strategies such as replacing specific words with synonyms or inserting random words, as shown by Wei and Zou in 2019. Our methodology for data augmentation consists of three steps: data augmentation with generation (DAG), data augmentation with modification (DAM), and a combined scheme of both methods (DAGAM). Our methodology offers a simple and effective strategy for automatically augmenting natural language data. To fine-tune and evaluate our methodology, we used BERT, a representative Transformer-based pre-trained language model. The results showed that our methodology improved performance on all benchmark datasets compared to the case without augmentation. Our contributions to the field of natural language processing include proposing DAG, DAM, and DAGAM as effective data augmentation methods and demonstrating their performance on various benchmark datasets. We evaluated the performance of our methodology on six benchmark datasets in text classification tasks, which were used to fine-tune and evaluate our methodology. To overcome the limitations of traditional data collection methods, we propose a new approach to data augmentation. Our methodology offers a simple and effective solution for automatically augmenting natural language data, which can improve the performance of deep learning models in text classification tasks.

To do this, ensure you consume at least three meals daily. Increase the portion size of your meals to help boost your calorie intake. Skipping breakfast and only eating two main meals can be a common tendency, but eating three meals daily can significantly aid in weight gain. If large meals upset your stomach, consider eating smaller meals throughout the day to accommodate your needs.\n\nEating frequently throughout the day can provide a consistent flow of calories. Aim to eat at least every 4 hours, whether it's a meal or a small snack. If you're not up to a full meal, opt for a snack that includes protein and three different types of food. This can be a combination of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Alternatively, you can create 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day instead of adding snacks between larger meals.\n\nPreparing snacks ahead of time can be beneficial in ensuring you eat when you should. Having easy-to-grab snacks on hand can increase the likelihood of consuming the necessary calories. For instance, you can mix dried fruit, dark chocolate chips, rolled oats, and a nut butter to create a calorie-dense snack. Divide the mixture into golf-ball size portions, wrap them individually in parchment or wax paper, and store them for later use.\n\nKeep trail mixes on hand as a quick snack option, as the combination of nuts and dried fruit is calorie-dense. However, eating frequently throughout the day can sometimes lead to feeling too full, resulting in inadequate calorie consumption. To combat this, consider incorporating liquid calories into your diet, such as smoothies, liquid yogurt, or fruit juice. These beverages can provide calories and nutrients without the feeling of fullness.\n\nDrinking water or any beverage before eating can fill you up and reduce your appetite. To leave room for essential calories, try drinking a calorie-rich beverage while eating, such as fruit juice or a smoothie. While snacks like chips and cookies may seem like an easy way to gain weight, they are often empty calories that are not healthy. Opt for nutrient-rich foods, including vegetables, fruits, and lean meats, as you increase your calorie intake.\n\nAvoid consuming foods high in sugar and calories, such as sodas and overly sugary snacks. These types of foods not only hinder weight gain but also do not provide essential nutrients for muscle and bone growth. Lifting and weight training are essential for building muscle mass, which supports added weight.\n\nStart with light exercises like bicep curls to begin your weight training journey. Hold a weight in each hand, bend your arms at the elbows, and lift the weights to your shoulders. Gradually decrease reps and increase weight as you become more comfortable with the exercise. In addition to weight training, regular exercise can increase your appetite, prompting you to consume more calories. Other low-impact exercises, such as swimming, biking, or push-ups, can also be effective in building muscle and supporting weight gain.\n\nRemember to start slowly and progress gradually, especially if you're new to weight training. As you become more comfortable, you can increase the intensity of your workouts and incorporate more exercises into your routine. By combining a balanced diet with regular exercise, you can achieve your weight gain goals in a healthy and sustainable way.", "scores": {"ppl": 17.452098846435547, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.374291181564331, "acc": 0.0}}}
