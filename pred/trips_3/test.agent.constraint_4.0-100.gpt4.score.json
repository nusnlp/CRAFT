{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Molecular science encompasses a broad spectrum of fields that study the structures, properties, and interactions of molecules, including various disciplines such as chemistry, physics, biology, and computer science. Molecular science is pivotal in drug discovery applications, including target identification and validation, structure-based drug design, and side effect prediction. However, most existing methods of discovering new molecules or tweaking existing ones are time-consuming, expensive, and prone to failure (Rodrigues et al., 2016). In recent years, computational methods have shown significant advantages in molecule generation and modification (Bilodeau et al., 2022). These techniques enable rapid identification and optimization of potential drug candidates; however, they are limited by their computational demands. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies have emerged as powerful tools for molecular science, revolutionizing the field and its applications. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the field, improving speed, accuracy, and scalability in molecular discovery and understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant contributions to both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and molecular science, with notable applications in the latter. MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022), a variant of the T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020), offers capabilities in molecule captioning (Mol2Cap) and text-based molecule generation (Cap2Mol). LLMs, such as MolT5, can describe molecules in words and generate structures from text. However, text-to-text models using these models still struggle to integrate molecular structure data and understand molecular images. To fuse and understand multi-modal data, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021), and BEIT-3 (Wang et al., 2022c), have established a foundation for adaptive learning across image-text modalities. In the context of molecular science, SwinOCSR (Xu et al., 2022) has been designed for image recognition, and it has shown significant benefits in document comprehension and multi-modal drug discovery database construction (Wang et al., 2022b), enhancing the field's capabilities. MoleculeSTM (Liu et al., 2022) and MoMu (Su et al., 2022) integrate the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) (Weininger, 1988) with graph representations to facilitate molecular property prediction tasks. This limitation underscores the need for modality data alignment processes, where multi-modal models can outperform language models by integrating diverse data types to enhance feature representation.

More recently, computational methods have demonstrated significant advantages in molecule generation and tweaking (Bilodeau et al., 2022), enabling rapid identification and optimization of potential drug candidates. However, these computational methods are limited by substantial computational demands.\n\nFortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for molecular science. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the field by improving speed, accuracy, and scalability in molecular discovery and understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and molecular science.

LLMs like MolT5 help describe molecules in words and generate structures from text. However, these text-to-text models cannot fully utilize the advantages of molecular structure data and understand molecular images.\n\nTo fuse and understand multi-modal data, the multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021), and BEIT-3 (Wang et al., 2022c) have laid the groundwork for adaptive learning across image-text modalities. In molecular science, SwinOCSR (Xu et al., 2022) is designed for image recognition, which significantly aids in document comprehension and multi-modal drug discovery database construction (Wang et al., 2022b). In addition, MoleculeSTM (Liu et al., 2022) and MoMu (Su et al., 2022) can combine the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) (Weininger, 1988) and graph representations for molecular property prediction tasks.\n\nExisting language models excel in processing textual molecular data, but processing molecular graphs and images is difficult, typically relying on processed vector encodings. This limitation highlights the need for a modality data alignment process, where multi-modal models outperform language models by integrating diverse data types for enhanced feature representation. Moreover, the scalability of molecular representation and generation models remains a significant challenge. Models capable of effectively fusing three or more modalities are scarce, and the complexity of integrating these diverse modalities, often with missing or incomplete data, calls for advanced modeling techniques.\n\nTo address the significant scalability challenges in molecular science and to harness the potential of vast quantities of unlabeled multi-modal data, we have developed a robust neural network architecture, which we refer to as GIT-Mol. At the core of GIT-Mol is the GIT-Former, which incorporates an advanced cross-attention mechanism. It is capable of mapping data from various modalities into a unified multi-modal representation. This approach not only enhances the model's ability to process and integrate diverse modalities efficiently but also effectively bridges the scalability gap, providing a powerful tool for various molecular applications.\n\nOur main contributions are as follows: \n\n\u2022 To utilize the available large amount of unlabeled multi-modal data, we develop a specialized multimodal large language model, GIT-Mol (700M), to efficiently cover all three modalities in molecular science (graph, image, and text) for molecule generation, molecule captioning, molecular image recognition, and molecular property prediction.\n\n\u2022 We present GIT-Former, a novel modality mixer designed with a cross-attention mechanism, enabling seamless fusion of three molecular modalities. Each fusion strategy within GIT-Former operates at the molecule level, ensuring optimal flexibility and scalability. The effectiveness of our multi-modal model is demonstrated in our extensive ablation studies, which provides an improvement of 10%-15% over the single-modality models.\n\nWe present a comprehensive overview of GIT-Mol in Figure 1. The architecture is composed of four primary components: Internal Information, External Information, GIT-Former Multi-modal Encoder, and Multi-modal Molecular Tasks. Internal Information, including sequence and graph structure representations, emphasizes inherent chemical properties and simple topology. External Information, such as images and text descriptions, provides richer details and helps human understanding. GIT-Former aligns graph, image, and text with the target text modality (SMILES strings or captions) using self-attention and cross-attention. The learnable queries interact with each other and the various modalities through these attention layers.\n\nFurthermore, we introduce Xmodal-Text Matching (XTM) and Xmodal-Text Contrastive Learning (XTC) as our self-supervised learning strategies tailored for specific modalities (X) and target text modalities. The quantitative evaluations indicate that GIT-Mol exhibits commendable performance and surpasses state-of-the-art on certain metrics, as it outperforms the baseline by 20% in the cross-modal molecule generation tasks regarding the validity of the generated molecules and by 5%-10% in molecular property prediction tasks.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, Section 2 primarily introduces multi-modal models and applications in molecular science. Section 3 introduces the principles of our GIT-Mol model. Section 4 focuses on the experimental setup and results for downstream tasks of the model.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Mother cats carry and control their kittens by firmly grabbing their scruff, allowing a secure grip and keeping them safe, showcasing the absolute importance of her grip in their survival and well-being. If you've seen a kitten handled this way by its mother, you'll notice that the kitten's instinctive reaction is a physical response, showcasing the deep bond between the mother and her offspring, who trusts and relies on her guidance and protection, highlighting the profound impact of her care on their development. Many cats continue to exhibit this behavior as adults when grabbed by the scruff, an instinctual leftover from their kittenhood when they relied on their mother's guidance and protection, which remains present even in adulthood, signifying that their maternal instincts have not faded. Avoid scruffing your cat in situations that would agitate the cat, such as eating, sleeping, waking, or being startled, as these can be stressful for your cat, causing unnecessary anxiety and discomfort. When your cat is sleeping, it's essential to let them sleep undisturbed, as waking them up by scruffing them can startle them and cause unnecessary stress, waking a sleeping cat can be particularly distressing and traumatic for them. When your cat is eating, interrupting their meal can cause them to become agitated and defensive, as cats are naturally protective of their food, and let them finish eating first to avoid this stress, which can escalate into anxiety and aggression. When your cat is agitated or excited, use gentle and soothing techniques to calm them down, such as speaking softly, stroking their fur, and offering treats, as they may be difficult to handle in this state and could scratch or bite, and establish trust with your cat. Scruffing a cat with arthritis or obesity can strain the neck muscles, which can be especially painful, and exercise caution and avoid scruffing in these situations, as it can cause long-term harm and distress to your cat. Some cats have less scruff due to their breed or genetics, making it difficult to grab the scruff, and you should be able to sense this when you attempt to grab it, as a cat with little scruff may not be able to support their own weight or may experience discomfort. Don't attempt to hold a cat with little scruff, as this can cause harm to both you and your cat, and prioritize their safety and well-being. Older cats may feel humiliated or embarrassed when being scruffed, as they may associate this behavior with their kittenhood and feel treated like a young animal again, which can be distressing and traumatic for them. To clip your cat's nails quickly and safely, keep them still, which will help prevent scratching or biting, and reduce the risk of injury to you and your cat. Trim your cat's nails when they're calm and relaxed, rather than when they're stressed or worked up, as trimming nails can be traumatic for cats if they're not in a relaxed state, and this will increase the chances of a successful nail trimming experience, and establish a positive experience for your cat. Use a supportive surface, such as a table or countertop, when scruffing your cat to trim their nails, as this will be more comfortable for both you and the cat, and improve their overall experience. This may require two people: one person to hold or restrain the cat, and another person to trim the nails, as having someone assist will make the experience safer and more manageable, and reduce the risk of injury to both you and your cat. When trimming nails or administering medication, you won't need to lift the cat in the air, as you can gently push their head toward the supportive surface and restrain their back end, and make the experience less stressful for your cat. Combing out mats in your cat's fur can be painful and uncomfortable for them, as it involves pulling and tugging on their fur, which can cause matting and tangling, and lead to long-term skin issues and hair loss. Since cats may want to move around when having mats combed out, keeping them still will be important to prevent discomfort or pain, and prioritize their comfort and well-being. Place your cat on a supportive surface prior to scruffing them to comb out mats, as this will make the experience more comfortable and manageable for both of you, and improve their overall experience. Use a wide-toothed comb, which is preferred for combing out mats, as it's gentler on the cat's fur and causes less discomfort, making it ideal for sensitive areas, and reduce the risk of injury or trauma to your cat. Cats can be difficult when someone tries to give them medications, as they may not want to cooperate or may become stressed and anxious, and this can be a challenging task for any cat owner, who may experience frustration and stress. With your free hand, hold the mat close to the skin and comb it out from the bottom to the top, just as you would with a knot in someone's hair. Keeping your cat still will increase your chances of giving them their treatment willingly, as a calm and relaxed cat is more likely to accept medication, and this will make the process less stressful for both you and your cat. With your free hand, hold the mat as close to the skin as possible and comb it out from the bottom to the top\u2013just as you would do if you were combing out a knot in person\u2019s hair. Scruff your cat on a supportive surface to help keep them calm and secure, and make it easier to administer medication, which will reduce stress and anxiety for both you and your cat. When giving a pill, gently tilt the cat's head up while scruffing them to guide the pill into their mouth, as this will help prevent choking hazards and make the process easier and safer, and prioritize their health and well-being. For injectable medications, it's safer to have your veterinarian or veterinary technician scruff the cat and administer the medication, as they have the necessary training and expertise to handle the situation safely and effectively, and reduce the risk of injury or trauma to your cat. Medication administration should be done with care, and scruffing should be used sparingly to minimize unnecessary stress or anxiety for your cat, as overusing scruffing can cause harm and distress, and prioritize their comfort and well-being. Roughly scruffing your cat when they're in trouble can be frightening and overwhelming, leading them to become more defensive or aggressive, so it's best to use gentle and gentle scruffing instead, which will help calm your cat and make the situation safer and more manageable, and prioritize their emotional well-being.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.265531539916992, "some": 0.8757344881693522, "bart": -2.3471529483795166, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's a revised text with more than 17 sentences, under 280 tokens, and each sentence having fewer than 13 tokens:\n\nApologizing in person shows you care.

I kept saying to myself, \"This doesn't seem right,\" and occasionally to the dogs. They were panting due to exhaustion. Their movements slowed, and I became nervous about their well-being. I didn't know how long we'd been lost, but my intuition guided me. Felt letters, likely \"P\"s or \"9\"s, hung from tree branches. They seemed out of place and caught our attention. I thought maybe God was telling me to head back towards 9 o'clock. Half an hour later, my dogs were struggling, but there was hope we'd find our way home. We were getting closer to home and freedom. We finally reached our home. I picked ticks off the dogs and got a lecture from my stepdad about our walks. I knew God had helped us.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Tailor the content, including word choice, references, and anecdotes, to the specific audience listening to the speech to make it more engaging and effective. For example, a \"don't do drugs\" speech aimed at first graders will have a vastly different tone and content compared to one targeting college students looking to raise awareness. As you listen to a speech, try to determine whether it effectively connects with the audience or falls flat. When critiquing a speech, avoid relying on your personal opinions and focus on how the speaker would be perceived by a wider audience. Objectivity is key when evaluating a speech, so try not to let your biases influence your assessment. Take note of audience reactions to the speech, such as whether they appear to be engaged, confused, or bored. Observe whether the speaker seems to be using clear, concise language and avoiding jargon, making the speech easy to follow. A well-structured speech should introduce the main topic within a few sentences and then build on the idea in a logical, coherent manner. Whether you agree with the speaker's views or not should be secondary to the content and delivery of the speech. When evaluating a speech, consider asking yourself these questions to determine whether it is clear and effective. Does the introduction set the tone and clearly state the main argument? Does the speech flow smoothly and build towards a logical conclusion, or are there distracting tangents that detract from the main point? If you were to summarize the speech, could you recall the main points and key takeaways? In a well-crafted speech, the speaker should demonstrate expertise on the subject and provide valuable insights to the audience. When critiquing a speech, look for areas where the speaker's reasoning may be flawed or where further research could strengthen their arguments. Pay attention to the speaker's use of evidence, such as names, dates, and data, to support their claims. Take note of any information the speaker presents, including names, dates, statistics, and research-related details, so you can fact-check later. Fact-checking is crucial to ensure the accuracy of the speaker's claims and maintain the credibility of the speech. Inaccurate data can undermine the entire speech, so it's essential to verify the facts presented. If you need to critique the speech immediately after it's given, using the internet to fact-check can be a useful tool. However, it's often better to wait until after the question-and-answer session or other breaks to fact-check and assess the speech more thoroughly. Anecdotes and jokes can help break up the tone and make the speech more engaging, but beware of distracting tangents that detract from the main point. A dry speech, no matter how convincing the argument, will fail to engage the audience and may not be heard. When determining whether a speech is engaging, ask yourself these questions to gauge its effectiveness. Does it start with a hook that grabs the audience's attention? Does it maintain engagement throughout the speech, or does it start to lose the audience's interest? A good speaker will use anecdotes and jokes judiciously to illustrate their points and keep the audience engaged. However, be cautious of anecdotes and jokes that may be distracting or unrelated to the main argument. Some listeners may focus only on the hook and miss the important points, so it's essential to pay close attention to the entire speech. To properly critique a speech, pay close attention to the speaker's use of examples and anecdotes, which can help highlight the main ideas. A speaker should use illustrations thoughtfully and sparingly, as three weak examples can be worse than one strong one. A good close should tie up the main points and provide the audience with new insights and ideas to apply. A poor closing can summarize the points without adding value or ignore them altogether, moving on to unrelated topics. The conclusion of a speech is a crucial part of the speech-making process, as it can leave a lasting impression on the audience. A strong conclusion should be powerful, thoughtful, deep, and concise, regaining the audience's attention and leaving a lasting impact. When ending a speech, a speaker should exude confidence, as this can help gain the audience's trust and confidence in the presentation.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.18843650817871, "some": 0.8714896043141683, "bart": -2.129348039627075, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's the refined text, with fewer than 480 tokens and retaining the term \"Maternity Leave\":\n\nThe birth of my first son was a pivotal moment in my life. For the first time, someone else held greater significance than my own desires. I've always navigated life with an underlying question: What do I want to achieve? How do I spend my day? Excessive freedom can be a heavy burden to bear. As I've recently experienced, even sleep deprivation can't overshadow the sense of liberation that comes with new motherhood. Perhaps having a partner by my side would alter my perspective. Currently, I'm sleep-deprived and should feel overwhelmed, yet I don't have the luxury of time.

Water was already pouring down my legs; I likened it to a bottle of champagne uncorking between my legs.\n\nI quickly made my way home, waddling like the duck from the slow lane over two slow blocks.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Once you write some songs that you\u2019re proud of, it\u2019s important to protect them before you start performing or sharing them with the public. As soon as you\u2019ve produced the final written version of your song, you can register your song with the U.S. Copyright Office to ensure that no one else can claim ownership of it. You\u2019ll also need a recorded version of the song. It doesn\u2019t have to be a professional recording from a studio, though. After you\u2019ve written at least one song that you\u2019re happy with, it\u2019s time to start singing it in front of an audience. Look for open mike nights at clubs, bars, and coffee shops in your area where you can test out your new songs, and gain more experience performing your material in front of a crowd. In addition to open mike nights, keep an eye out for talent shows and music festivals in your area that might allow you to perform your songs. If you want to get more exposure and see how your songwriting compares to other artists\u2019 work, you may want to enter a songwriting contest. Not only may you win money or other prizes that can help fund your singer songwriter career, you may also make contacts in the music industry that can help you advance. There are a variety of different contests for songwriting, such as the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the International Songwriting Competition. Some may be geared toward specific genres, though, so be sure to find one that\u2019s a good fit for your song(s). Do an online search to find songwriting competitions that you may want to enter. In some cases, you may be better off entering local contests because you won\u2019t be competing against as many other songwriters. Another way to get more visibility as a singer songwriter is to share your music via social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. YouTube is probably the best tool -- create an account and make videos of yourself singing your original songs. Through the other social media apps, you can share them with friends, family, and potential fans, who will hopefully share them with more people so you can create a larger following. You can also use social media to advertise performances. The more people that you help bring to an open mike night, festival, or other venue, the more of a commodity you\u2019ll seem to booking agents and music industry executives. It\u2019s also a good idea to create a website for yourself and your music. There are a variety of website building sites that make it easy to create a site even if you\u2019re not a computer expert. A fee may be required, though. When TV shows, commercial companies, and other businesses need music, they often consult online music catalogs. You can submit your songs to these catalogs so companies can listen to your music and see if it\u2019s a fit for what they need. It\u2019s a good way to break into the industry because it will be cheaper to use an aspiring songwriter\u2019s music than to use a successful, popular musician. Some online catalogs charge a fee to list your songs, so be sure to read the fine print to know what you\u2019re in for. Some record companies accept unsolicited demos from aspiring singer songwriters, so you can send them recordings of your songs to see if they\u2019re interested. The best way to identify companies that you should contact is to consider the labels that represent singer songwriters with a similar style to yours. Do an online search for the company, and see what their submission policy is. If you\u2019re going to be sending a demo to a record company, you should have a professional recording of your music.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "This is the most common reason students have for missing school. If you genuinely do not feel well or believe yourself to be ill, tell your parents and ask to stay home. Many schools will ask that students stay home if they have an illness or other condition that could be contagious. Staying home allows you to recover and prevents the spread of disease throughout the school. You should stay home if you have symptoms such as a fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, trouble swallowing, rash, unusual sores, unusual spots, earache, moderate to severe headache, moderate muscle ache, muscle pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing, red or burning eyes, or head lice. You might also need to stay home if you are coughing, sneezing, or congested, in addition to experiencing these other symptoms. You should stay home until you are free from symptoms without medication for at least 24 hours, ideally. For instance, if you have recently lost a family member or friend, your grief is a legitimate reason to stay home from school, and be honest with your parents about how deeply the loss has affected you. If the tragedy affected you but did not affect your parents, you might worry that they will not understand your grief, but grief is a universal feeling that most people can relate to, allowing a grieving person time to work through it. However, it's essential to understand that your initial mourning period will need to have an end, and intense grief might last for a long time, but if you do not feel capable of going to school after a few days to a week, you should consider talking to a counselor to help you work through your sorrow. If you are the victim of a bully or group of bullies at school, do not keep quiet about it, as many students make the mistake of doing so, being labeled a \"tattletale,\" or making things worse by talking about it, but taking steps to put an end to the bullying, such as getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults, is one of the most effective things you can do. Bullying can have long-term effects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life is crucial to stopping the bullying, and you can also tell a trusted adult, such as a parent or teacher, about the situation. You can also tell your mom that you'd like a special day with them, and ask them to call in sick from work, especially if you are graduating and moving away to college soon or it\u2019s a light work day for you and your mom. It's essential to talk to your parents about stress and anxiety, as adults occasionally forget just how stressful school life can be, but the truth is that it really can be tough, and if you are dealing with ordinary school-related stress, it might be more beneficial for you to push through, but if stress, anxiety, and depression become more serious issues, let your parent or legal guardian know and ask for a day off. If you suspect that you might have a serious mental health issue, like depression or an anxiety disorder, ask your parents to schedule an appointment with your doctor, as this can help you get the disorder under control. In the event of a massive blizzard, major flooding, or other circumstances that make traveling to school hazardous, your school system might close for the day, regardless of what your parents might say. If the conditions are hazardous and the school does not close, however, consider staying home, as your parent or legal guardian can help determine if conditions are severe enough to justify staying home, and if your parents are staying home from work due to the weather, they will likely be more open to the idea of keeping you home from school. A family vacation or visit from a relative who lives far away might give you a reason to be absent from school, but you should avoid missing school for reasons like this too often, and consider what you might miss if you go to school versus what you might miss if you stay home and work with your parents to decide whether staying home is a valid option. Note that many schools will not accept reasons like these as valid excuses, and if this is the case with your school, you will need to let your parents know so that they can tell the school you will be absent without providing a reason. Typically, if you know that you will be home from school ahead of time, your parent or legal guardian should write a note for you to take in a day or two before your planned absence, giving your teachers time to prepare work for you to take home over your absence.", "scores": {"ppl": 16.28763771057129, "some": 0.8858680725097656, "bart": -1.1130969524383545, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "If you don't know a lot about auto mechanics, bring someone along with you for the best results.

If you are unsure of how to check this, have an experienced mechanic show you. \n\nAgain, a brand new air filter can be a red flag, as it might be a way to cover or postpone engine failure. That said, these cheap parts are easy to replace and should be replaced often, so as long as it's not brand new without an explanation you should be fine. The oil from the dipstick should be black and free from grit. \n\nThe coolant should not have any particulate matter in it, or be sludgy or brown. This indicates serious issues with the engine that make the car unsafe and costly to repair. If the oil is red or green it is probably brand new. Again, if the seller is not upfront about this it can be a red flag that she/he is hiding bigger issues. \n\nIt should smell sweet and have little particulate matter. Burnt orange or brown fluid means it hasn't been changed in a long time. Avoid test driving the car if there are issues with the transmission, as it locking up or otherwise braking could cause an accident. This is for automatic transmissions. For a manual transmission, check the clutch master cylinder for leaks, etc.; and the clutch pedal; it shouldn't feel either too stiff or too loose. \n\nDoes the shifter hang up or pop out of gear? Those would be considered deal enders. Run the heat and the air conditioning to see how well they run. The air conditioning may need coolant to improve cooling. The fan should blow without any obstruction or excessive noise. \n\nDrive as you normally would, for a period of time that is sensible. This includes freeway and city driving. Keep an eye on the engine temperature, ease of steering and the ease of shifting gears, as well as the status of check engine light. \n\nYou can monitor the gear shifts by observing the tachometer's rise and fall with acceleration. Many minor repairs can be accomplished relatively quickly. Keep the stereo off so that you can listen into the car for dangerous sounds or unwelcome noises. \n\nYou can test the sound system, but make it quick. Try to drive, if possible, at a variety of speeds and locations.

For the first time in my life, someone else's desires and needs took precedence over mine, a suffocating feeling of being overshadowed that I'd never experienced before. Until now, my own desires and goals had always been pressing, but the question of what I wanted to do with my day or what my purpose was had often eluded me, a mystery that seemed out of reach. I once cherished the luxury of sleep, but in the last month, I barely got any rest, my nights rendered sleepless by the demands of a newborn. And yet, I've never felt so carefree and unencumbered, as if the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders and I'd been set free. Maybe I'd feel differently if I had a loving partner to share the experience with, someone who could understand the complex emotions and daunting challenges that come with new motherhood. I'm utterly drained, exhausted of every last ounce of energy, but I couldn't afford to feel overwhelmed by fatigue\u2014not when I had to care for my newborn son, whose tiny life depended on me. It's been months since I last wrote, and it feels like a new chapter is unfolding, one that's full of promise and limitless possibility. When I'd completed three months of maternity leave, I started to feel a growing sense of unease, like something was off-kilter and out of balance, a nagging feeling that wouldn't subside. After swimming at the pool and watching a duck glide effortlessly through the water, I got out\u2014and that's when I felt a sudden, intense gush of water, like a dam had burst and I was swept up in a torrent of life. Time seemed to freeze in suspended animation\u2014the water pouring down my legs like a relentless deluge, and I knew I was in labor, my whole world turned upside down. I'd been living with my overprotective dad and gentle stepmother, a household marked by love and concern for my well-being. My dad reminded me of my mom's rapid, intense labors\u2014he didn't think I needed the doctor just yet, not until the contractions started getting closer together, like a ticking time bomb counting down to a new reality. I'm told that memory helps block pain, so those lost minutes during labor likely feel like a hazy, indistinct blur to me now\u2014a time that's been erased from my conscious mind, lost in the fog of experience. That one hour of pushing transformed me into a mother\u2014in an instant, everything changed, like a switch had been flipped and I'd been reborn into a new reality, one that was both exhilarating and overwhelming. In that moment, they placed the tiny, red-haired baby in my arms\u2014and I felt the overwhelming, all-consuming joy of loving someone more than myself for the first time\u2014a feeling that has stayed with me ever since, a love that has changed me forever.", "scores": {"ppl": 21.467998504638672, "some": 0.891376813252767, "bart": -2.8034932613372803, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Pinworms can affect anyone, regardless of age.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "People of all ages, from young children to the elderly, can be affected by pinworms, leading to a wide range of symptoms that vary depending on the individual's age and overall health. The primary mode of transmission is through the fecal-oral route, where pinworm eggs are ingested through contaminated fingers, bedding, clothing, and other objects, typically as a result of poor hygiene or close contact with an infected individual, and this transmission can occur when people touch these contaminated items and then put their hands in their mouths or rub their faces. Pinworm eggs are spread person-to-person by being ingested, often through direct contact or by touching surfaces that harbor the eggs, which can then be transferred to fingers, bedding, clothing, and other items. For example, a child with a pinworm infection may experience intense itching around the rectum and inadvertently transfer eggs to their fingers or under their fingernails, then transmit them to an object or another person, or even re-infect themselves, highlighting the importance of proper hygiene practices to prevent the spread of pinworms. The risk of contracting a pinworm infection is increased when you are exposed to individuals with poor or inadequate hygiene, as contaminated objects and surfaces can facilitate the spread of the eggs, and this is why it is essential to maintain good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing and proper cleaning of living spaces. High-risk groups include children in school or daycare, people who are institutionalized, and family members, household members, and caregivers of the first two groups, as these individuals are more likely to come into close contact with infected individuals due to shared spaces, frequent interactions, and a higher likelihood of poor hygiene practices, which puts them at a greater risk of contracting the infection. Children's hands are particularly problematic due to their tendency to touch their faces, play with toys, and engage in other behaviors that increase the risk of pinworm transmission, making them a high-risk factor for the spread of the infection, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. Children often put their hands or fingers in their mouths, touch surfaces, or wipe them on clothes, which can facilitate the spread of pinworm eggs and increase the risk of transmission, and this is why it is crucial to practice good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, to prevent the spread of pinworms. Moderate-risk individuals include those who come into contact with high-risk groups, as they may be exposed to pinworm eggs through contaminated surfaces or objects, highlighting the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of the infection. To prevent pinworm transmission, following standard hygiene guidelines is crucial, and this includes proper handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, and keeping living spaces clean, as these practices can significantly reduce the risk of transmission. Low-risk individuals, such as adults who have little to no contact with high-risk groups, are less likely to contract a pinworm infection, as their lower exposure to contaminated objects and surfaces reduces their risk of transmission, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. After a pinworm egg is digested, there is an incubation period of one to two months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine, where the worm develops and prepares to lay eggs, during which time it may not display any noticeable symptoms, and this is why a pinworm infection can be challenging to diagnose. Once mature, the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night, when many of their hosts are asleep, using a sticky substance that adheres the eggs to the skin and triggers an itching sensation, which can be intense and uncomfortable, and this is why the itching is usually worse at night. This is why the itching is usually worse at night: the worms are migrating to the area around the rectum to lay their eggs, taking advantage of the host's inactivity to maximize their reproductive success, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. Scratching an itch can transfer microscopic pinworm eggs to your fingers, where they can be ingested or transferred to other surfaces, highlighting the importance of avoiding scratching the affected area and practicing good hygiene to prevent the spread of the infection. From there, the eggs can be transferred to the mouth or other mucous membranes, where they can hatch and develop into adult worms, perpetuating the cycle of infection, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. This hand-to-mouth transaction can also occur indirectly, as the eggs can be passed to surfaces and then picked up by others who ingest them, often through contaminated food or drinks, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing and surface cleaning, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. The eggs can live on surfaces for two to three weeks and be picked up by others who put their unwashed hands to their mouth, highlighting the importance of frequent handwashing and surface cleaning to prevent the spread of pinworms. In addition to a noticeable irritation in the rectal area, someone can have a pinworm infection without displaying any symptoms at all, making diagnosis challenging and requiring careful examination and testing, and this is why good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, are essential in preventing the spread of pinworms. When symptoms are present, they may include restlessness, poor sleep, especially if it's a new issue, bedwetting, irritability, such as teeth-grinding, vaginal discharge in females, and bacterial skin infections, highlighting the need for prompt medical attention to diagnose and treat the infection. If you suspect a pinworm infestation, your doctor may ask you to place a piece of clear, sticky tape against the rectum to check for eggs, a non-invasive and effective method for detecting the presence of pinworms, and this is why it is essential to seek medical attention if you suspect a pinworm infection. Pinworm eggs will stick to the tape, which your doctor can then examine under a microscope to confirm the presence of an infestation, providing a definitive diagnosis and guiding treatment, and this is why good communication with your doctor is essential in diagnosing and treating a pinworm infection. The doctor might also take some samples from under the infected person's fingernails and examine them for eggs, providing additional evidence of the presence of pinworms, and this is why good communication with your doctor is essential in diagnosing and treating a pinworm infection. You may also use a pinworm paddle, a spatula-like device that scoops the anal area and holds it in a plastic test tube to check for eggs, offering a convenient and effective method for detecting pinworms, and this is why it is essential to seek medical attention if you suspect a pinworm infection.", "scores": {"ppl": 16.912012100219727, "some": 0.8802711168924967, "bart": -2.1051645278930664, "acc": 0.25}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Pinworms can affect young and old alike due to fecal-oral transmission.

They can then transmit the eggs to an object or another person.\n\nThose who are at high risk include school children, people in institutions, and their family members or caregivers. Children's hands go everywhere, often without washing, and they frequently put their hands in their mouths or touch toys and other objects. The same applies to individuals in institutions, making their environments a breeding ground for pinworms.\n\nModerate-risk individuals include those who come into contact with high-risk individuals. To minimize this risk, follow standard hygiene guidelines. Since it's hard to avoid people with pinworms, focus on maintaining good hygiene to protect yourself.\n\nLow-risk individuals have minimal contact with high-risk or moderate-risk groups. Adults who have little to no contact with these groups are at a low risk for pinworm infections. \n\nPinworm eggs are digested, resulting in an incubation period of one to two months for adult worms to mature in the small intestine. Once mature, the female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night. These eggs contain \"glue\" that adheres them to the anus, causing itching. The itching is usually worse at night due to the worms laying eggs.\n\nScratching an itch can transfer microscopic pinworm eggs to your fingers.

Prior studies have confirmed that certain neurons within deep neural networks play important roles in learning particular concepts, preserving factual knowledge, and solving specific tasks (Oikarinen and Weng, 2022; Bai et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). This understanding is crucial for enhancing model interpretability and has led to various practical applications of Neuron Analysis, including model distillation (Dalvi et al., 2020), knowledge editing (Chavhan et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2023), and controllable generation (Bau et al., 2019; Kojima et al., 2024).\n\nResearchers have made significant progress in identifying neurons responsible for target scenarios, which is central to such endeavors. Recent studies have focused on interpreting the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) under the view of language-specific neurons, which are neurons uniquely responsible for particular languages (Kojima et al., 2024). For instance, Kojima et al. identified such neurons in pre-trained decoder-based language models, demonstrating that tampering with a few language-specific neurons significantly alters the occurrence probability of target language in text generation.\n\nSimilarly, Zhao et al. (2024c) detected language-specific neurons by measuring the significance of neurons when processing multilingual inputs and proposed a workflow of LLMs handling multilingual tasks. Moreover, Tang et al.

These studies highlight the importance of understanding language-specific neurons in LLMs.\n\nWhile researchers have made significant progress in understanding language-specific neurons, there is a need to explore domain-specific neurons in the context of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Domain-specific neurons refer to neurons that are unique to a particular domain or set of domains.

There is a pressing need to estimate the performance of these models for low-resource languages without the time-consuming and computationally expensive process of model pre-training and fine-tuning.

This challenge is particularly pronounced for low-resource languages (LRLs). Knowing how well a language model performs on a specific language can be valuable information, such as improving the accuracy of quality estimation (QE) models (Zouhar et al., 2023). Therefore, there is a need to estimate the performance of these models for LRLs without conducting time-consuming and computationally expensive model pre-training and fine-tuning. Existing approaches for predicting model performance on NLP tasks have shown promise using linear regression and gradient boosting trees (Birch et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2020; Srinivasan et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2021). These studies have considered data size, typological features, and language similarity as contributing factors to model performance. However, most of these studies were conducted for high-resource languages (HRLs), limiting their applicability to LRLs. Domain shift has been observed to significantly impact NLP task performance (Elsahar and Gall\u00e9, 2019), but this factor is not explicitly considered in existing works predicting language model performance.  Furthermore, performance drops in NLP tasks have been observed due to domain shift. Based on the limitations in the literature, we considered three factors for the Machine Translation (MT) performance prediction for LRLs using classical regression models: the size of the fine-tuning corpus, the domain similarity between fine-tuning and testing corpora, and the language similarity between source and target languages. To test the statistical reliability of these regression models, we evaluated them based on their prediction accuracy. We selected the models with relatively high accuracy for each factor and explored how data partitioning affects the quality of fit using these preferred models. We also analyzed the importance of the factors by ranking them based on their correlation with the MT performance, their weights in multifactor regression models, and their importance in multifactor models using the Random Forest Regressor. Our main contributions are: 1) a statistically rigorous method for performance prediction that can be repeated on any combination of LRLs, NLP tasks, and LLMs; 2) an evaluation of the impact of various factors on the performance of MT models; 3) domain-specific and language-specific interpretations based on the performance of the regression models.

Incidents severe enough to warrant repercussions on their own include any physical abuse or intimidation, or verbal abuse that is blatantly racist, sexist, or derogatory in nature. Smaller incidents may add up to a pattern of bullying or harassment, which can be just as damaging to your well-being and career. For example, a coworker may consistently make comments about how stupid you are, or how you are the reason sales are down, in a deliberate attempt to belittle you. They may imply that you aren't qualified for your job, and that you only got your position because of your race or your gender, which is a classic form of harassment.\n\nIn your log, write down every detail of each occurrence, including the names of any witnesses who were present, as they can provide valuable testimony later on. Then provide a brief, factual description of the events that occurred, including as many specific details as possible \u2013 you may not remember them later, and your log can help refresh your recollection. Legally, behavior must be \"unwelcome\" to be subject to any penalty, which means you need to make it clear that you do not consent to the harassment or attention. In some instances, it may be obvious that no one would welcome the behavior, but in others, you may need to make a formal complaint to ensure the perpetrator understands the gravity of their actions.\n\nIf a coworker is sexually harassing you by constantly hitting on you, simply ignoring them won't make the problem go away and may not communicate the message effectively. As long as you say nothing, they can argue that they thought you enjoyed the attention, which is a common tactic used by harassers. For example, suppose a coworker continually leaves notes and small presents on your desk, and comments on your clothing each day, making you feel uncomfortable and uneasy. You might say \"I'm not interested in any relationship with you outside of work, and your persistence won't change that. This kind of attention is unwelcome and makes me feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nIt may be a good idea to put this communication in writing, just so you have a record of telling the person that their behavior is unwelcome. Send them an email through the company email system, and blind-copy a coworker or supervisor who can provide support and witness the communication. If someone is bullying you in the workplace, there are likely coworkers who have been in the same room or nearby and seen the behavior, and may be willing to testify on your behalf.\n\nYou may even find out that the person has also been bullying others in the workplace, which can be a useful piece of information when reporting incidents to HR or management. If a coworker witnessed an actual incident of bullying, ask them if they would be willing to go on the record with their story to support or corroborate yours. If witnesses tell you about others who have been bullied by the same person, talk to them to find out how they were treated and what happened as a result, as this can help build a stronger case against the perpetrator.\n\nOften people who resort to bullying tactics in the workplace have a pattern of treating multiple people the same way, which can be a clear indication of their behavior. If the person who is bullying or harassing you sends you any emails, or leaves things in your workspace, take care to preserve them as evidence. Physical evidence is extremely valuable because so many of these disputes come down to one person's word against the other's, and having concrete proof can make all the difference in a formal investigation.\n\nThis is especially important if the person who is bullying or harassing you is a supervisor, or has worked for the company longer than you have and has a generally good reputation.

Just be pleasant, polite, and respectful, and you'll find it easier to get past security and enjoy the ultimate concert experience. Make casual conversation with the security guards, and try not to give the impression that you're desperate to get backstage, even if you really are; instead, focus on building a rapport and establishing trust, which will increase your chances of getting access. If you notice a roadie lugging equipment onto the stage, you can try asking if you can help them, which may lead to a positive interaction with security and create a memorable experience. If you're allowed to help, work diligently and express gratitude to the roadies for the opportunity, which may earn you some goodwill with security and increase your chances of staying backstage. This strategy may get you backstage and provide an exciting on-stage vantage point during the concert, but be aware of the risks involved, such as getting kicked out or damaging your reputation. You're less likely to get backstage with a large group, but if it's just you or just you and a pal, security will be less likely to bother with you, giving you a better chance of getting past them. Trying to sneak backstage at a concert is risky because you can get kicked out if you're caught, which may damage your reputation and relationships with the artist and their team, making it harder to get access in the future. If you do get caught sneaking backstage, remain calm, apologize, and cooperate with security, which may reduce the likelihood of being removed from the premises and give you a second chance. Although you may be thrilled inside, it's essential to act nonchalant if you manage to get backstage, as excessive excitement may draw unwanted attention from security and ruin the experience. Instead, take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy your time backstage, which may lead to memorable experiences and opportunities that you'll cherish for a lifetime. Stay calm and composed if you bump into your idol while exploring the backstage area, as you never know how they may react and you want to make a positive impression. It's perfectly fine to show a little excitement when meeting your idol, as long as you avoid gushing excessively or coming on too strong, which may make them uncomfortable and create an awkward situation. If you have something you'd like to get signed, ask politely if the artist would mind signing it for you, and be respectful of their time and preferences, as they may have other commitments or priorities. If you want to pay your idol a compliment, go for it \u2013 just keep it simple and sincere, as they appreciate genuine and heartfelt praise. Try saying something like: \"I've been a fan for a long time. Thank you for creating such awesome music!\" Talking with your idol in a relaxed and conversational manner is also less likely to catch the attention of security, which may increase your odds of getting to stay backstage and enjoying the experience without any issues.", "scores": {"ppl": 20.476943969726562, "some": 0.8802711168924967, "bart": -2.1805429458618164, "acc": 0.5}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Most concerts offer a VIP package for purchase, which typically includes a meet-and-greet opportunity and autographs.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Let's work with the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 4x + 5, which will be broken down into its component parts to identify the steps required to simplify it, focusing on factoring the quadratic expression. To factor the quadratic expression, we will first factor out the coefficient from the first two terms by pulling it out of the expression and placing it inside a set of parentheses around both terms, effectively rewriting the expression in a more efficient form. For instance, when factoring out the coefficient 3 from the first two terms, we obtain 3x^2 divided by 3 equals x^2 and 4x divided by 3 equals 4/3x, making the expression more manageable. The resulting equation will look like this: 3(x^2 - 4/3x) + 5, with the constant term remaining outside of the parentheses, indicating the initial step in the factoring process. To continue factoring, we must halve the constant term, which is the b-term in the equation, by dividing it in half. This is a crucial step in achieving a simplified form of the quadratic expression. To calculate this, we need to perform the division by multiplying 4/3 by 1/2, which simplifies to 2/3, providing the required value for the next step in the factoring process. Now, we need to square this term by squaring both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction, which gives us (2/3)^2 = 4/9, a fundamental operation in algebraic manipulation. We will write this term down and note that it is the \"extra\" term needed to turn the first two terms in this equation into a perfect square, which is a critical component of factoring the quadratic expression. However, when you add it, you essentially add a negative term, which can be a bit counterintuitive and requires careful consideration to avoid errors in the factoring process. Although simply combining the terms won't help, as you'll be right back where you started, you need to think more strategically about how to complete the factoring process, which involves careful planning and execution. Right now, you're left with 3(x - 2/3)^2 - 4/3 + 5; to add -4/3 and 5, we need to set them to the same denominator by converting 5 to 15/3, then add the numerators to get 11/3, making it easier to combine the terms. You have now completed the factoring process, and the final equation is 3(x - 2/3)^2 + 11/3; to simplify this further, divide both parts of the equation by 3 to get (x - 2/3)^2 + 11/9, which is the fully simplified form of the quadratic expression.", "scores": {"ppl": 21.49587059020996, "some": 0.8941826820373535, "bart": -2.3633415699005127, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "To refine the given text, we'll ensure that the word 'three' is not included and meet the output requirements. Here's the revised text:\n\nWhen working with the equation 3x2 - 4x + 5, one approach to factor out a term is to rewrite the equation by pulling out a common factor. In this case, we can pull out a 3 and place it around a set of parenthesis around both terms, while dividing each term by 3. The first term, 3x2, divided by 3 is x2, and the second term, 4x, divided by 3 is 4/3x. The new equation should look like this: 3(x2 - 4/3x) + 5. The 5 will remain outside of the equation because it was not divided by 3.\n\nTo continue factoring, we need to find a term that will complete the square. The second term in the equation is 4/3. Dividing this term by 2 gives us 2/3. Squaring this term by squaring both the numerator and denominator of the fraction yields 4/9. We'll need this \"extra\" term to turn the first three terms in this equation into a perfect square. However, we need to remember that we added it by subtracting it from the equation as well.\n\nThe new equation should look like this: 3(x2 - 4/3x + 4/9 - 4/9) + 5. Since we're working with a coefficient of 3 outside the parentheses, we can't just pull out the -4/9. We'll have to multiply it by 3 first. -4/9 x 3 equals -12/9, or -4/3. If we're not working with an equation with a coefficient other than 1 over the x2 term, then we could skip this step.\n\nNow, we're left with 3(x2 - 4/3x + 4/9) within the parentheses. We worked backwards to get the 4/9, which was really another way of finding the term that would complete the square. So, we can rewrite those terms like this: 3(x - 2/3)2. All we had to do was halve the second term and remove the third.\n\nChecking this works involves multiplying it out to see that it gives us the first three terms of the equation. 3(x - 2/3)2 equals 3(x - 2/3)(x - 2/3), which equals 3[(x2 - 2/3x - 2/3x + 4/9)]. Simplifying, we get 3(x2 - 4/3x + 4/9). This equation is now in a perfect square form.\n\nWe're left with two constant terms, or terms that aren't attached to a variable. Right now, we're left with 3(x - 2/3)2 - 4/3 + 5. To add these terms, we set them to the same denominator: -4/3 and 15/3. Adding the numerators gives us 11, and keeping the denominator as 3. -4/3 + 15/3 equals 11/3.\n\nWe're all done. The final equation is 3(x - 2/3)2 + 11/3. We can remove the coefficient of 3 by dividing both parts of the equation to get (x - 2/3)2 + 11/9.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Walk into any kitchen store, and you'll notice a dizzying array of items, including a wide selection of pots, pans, utensils, and gadgets that cater to various cooking techniques and recipes, from baking and grilling to saut\u00e9ing and roasting. The array can be overwhelming, but the essentials for a good kitchen can get you through 90% of all recipes, including a good skillet, saucepots, roasting pan, and a Dutch oven, which are versatile and can be used in various recipes, such as searing scallops, slow-cooking stews, or roasting vegetables. A good skillet can sear steaks, cook omelets, and make paninis, while a saucepot can simmer sauces, cook pasta, and heat up leftovers. A roasting pan can cook a whole chicken, roast vegetables, and make a perfect prime rib, and a Dutch oven can slow-cook stews, braises, and casseroles. These essentials are the backbone of any kitchen and can be used in a variety of dishes, from simple weeknight meals to elaborate special occasion recipes. A good starting point for any kitchen is to have a solid foundation of essential tools, such as a large skillet, a small skillet, a 5-gallon saucepot, a 1-gallon saucepot, a roasting pan, a casserole dish, a Dutch oven, metal mixing bowls, a knife set, and a metal cutting board. A large skillet is perfect for searing steaks, cooking omelets, and making paninis, while a small skillet is great for cooking small meals, such as scrambled eggs or reheating leftovers. A 5-gallon saucepot can simmer large batches of soup or stew, while a 1-gallon saucepot is perfect for cooking smaller batches of sauce or soup. A roasting pan can cook a whole chicken, roast vegetables, and make a perfect prime rib, and a Dutch oven can slow-cook stews, braises, and casseroles. Cutting boards are a crucial element in any kitchen, and it's essential to have at least two, one specifically for meat and the other for other ingredients, such as fruits and vegetables. Using separate cutting boards for raw meat and other ingredients helps prevent cross-contamination and ensures a safe and healthy cooking environment. Cross-contamination can occur when raw meat, poultry, or seafood is in contact with other ingredients, which can lead to foodborne illness. In addition to cutting boards, dry and wet measuring cups and spoons, metal tongs, and mixing utensils like whisks, wooden spoons, slotted spoons, ladles, and spatulas are also must-haves for any kitchen. Dry measuring cups and spoons are perfect for measuring dry ingredients, such as flour and sugar, while wet measuring cups and spoons are great for measuring liquids, such as water and oil. Metal tongs are perfect for flipping food in a pan, while mixing utensils like whisks, wooden spoons, slotted spoons, ladles, and spatulas are great for mixing and stirring food. You'll spend more time on your knife than on any other tool, and it pays to use it well, as a good knife can make a huge difference in the efficiency of your cooking and the quality of the final dish. A good knife can chop, slice, and dice ingredients with ease, making cooking faster and more enjoyable. Some key tips for professional knife work include gripping the knife correctly, cutting forward and back with a curved blade, and using a gentle rocking motion to achieve smooth cuts. To achieve smooth cuts, grip the knife with a firm, but not overly tight, grasp, and hold the knife at a 45-degree angle to the cutting board. Cut forward and back with a curved blade, using a gentle rocking motion to guide the knife through the ingredient. This technique will help you achieve smooth cuts and prevent accidents in the kitchen. Good cooks are excellent time managers, utilizing every second in the kitchen efficiently, so they aren't running around with their heads cut off or leaving things accidentally on the stove. To achieve this, prepping ahead of time is essential, including chopping vegetables, measuring out ingredients into cups or bowls, and cleaning workspaces before cooking, not during. Prepping ahead of time will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Chopping vegetables is a crucial step in prepping, as it helps to release the flavors and textures of the ingredients. Measuring out ingredients into cups or bowls ensures that you have the right amounts of each ingredient, which is essential for achieving the perfect balance of flavors. Cleaning workspaces before cooking helps to prevent cross-contamination and ensures a safe and healthy cooking environment. Getting all the needed tools and items out of storage and in the kitchen, and doing each stage of prepping all at once, can save time and reduce stress in the kitchen. For example, skinning all the onions at once, then cutting all the onions at once, optimizes onion prep and reduces waste. This approach will help you stay focused and efficient, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Good meal planning also helps you get the most out of your shopping, reusing ingredients and minimizing waste. To plan meals and recipes effectively, write out a little calendar and plan out meals for the next 2-3 days to start, looking up recipes with some ingredient overlap for the best results. Meal planning will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that you use every ingredient and reduce waste. Keeping a list of your favorite meals and recipes can make future meal planning easier, as it provides a reference point for planning and reduces the need for last-minute decisions. By looking up recipes in advance, you'll also see how different ingredients can be used in different ways, expanding your cooking vocabulary. This approach will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that you use every ingredient and reduce waste. Having an organized kitchen allows you to keep cooking or working on new dishes with ease, as it keeps your workspaces clean and clutter-free. Anytime you handle raw meat or fish, wash down all surfaces and utensils used to maintain proper sanitation and hygiene practices in the kitchen. This approach will help you stay safe and healthy, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Good cooks also hit the trashcan and/or compost bin a lot, trimming bits of food and unwrapping or opening ingredients, which helps maintain a clean and organized kitchen. Keeping a trash receptacle right on hand makes you faster and more hygienic in the kitchen. This approach will help you stay organized and focused, ensuring that your dishes are cooked to perfection. Poor planning and organization can lead to food waste and reduced cooking efficiency, as seen in the case of shrimp burning if you have to run around looking for the sea salt, onions and potatoes losing flavor and texture if stored wrong, and leftovers going to waste if you don't keep the fridge in some semblance of order. There is a reason most professional kitchens are run with army-like precision, as an organized kitchen allows all of your energy to go into the food, not finding it. Give yourself ample space, using the biggest cutting boards you can fit, and keep everything grouped \u2013 spices, vegetables, cooking oils, etc. \u2013 so they are easy to find.

To factor out a common factor from the first two terms, we can pull out a 3 and place it around a set of parentheses around both terms, while dividing each term by 3, resulting in the terms 3x^2 divided by 3, which is simply x^2, and 4x divided by 3, which is 4/3x. This means that the new equation should look like this: 3(x^2 - 4/3x) + 5, where the 5 remains outside of the equation because we did not divide it by 3. The second term in this equation, also known as the b term, is 4/3x, and in order to proceed, we need to halve the coefficient of the x term by dividing it by 2 first. When we halve the coefficient of 4/3x, we get -4/3, which is obtained by dividing 4/3 by 2, or equivalently, by multiplying 4/3 by 1/2. Now, we need to square this term by squaring both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction, which gives us (2/3)^2 = 4/9. This \"extra\" term is necessary to turn the first several terms of this equation into a perfect square, but we need to remember that we added it by subtracting it from the equation as well, which means that it will be eliminated when we combine the terms. Although combining the terms may seem like a good idea, it will ultimately lead us back to the original equation, so we should proceed with caution. The new equation should look like this: 3(x^2 - 4/3x + 4/9 - 4/9) + 5, where we have effectively added and subtracted 4/9. However, we cannot simply pull out -4/9 from the equation outside the parentheses because it has a coefficient of 3. To get around this, we can multiply -4/9 by 3, which gives us -4/3. If the equation outside the parentheses had a coefficient of 1, we could have skipped this step altogether. At this point, we are left with the equation 3(x - 2/3)^2 + 11/3, which can be simplified to 3(x - 2/3)^2 + 5. This simplification is based on the fact that we only needed to halve the coefficient of the x term and eliminate the extra term. To verify this result, we can expand the expression and see that it yields the original equation. When we expand 3(x - 2/3)^2, we get 3(x - 2/3)(x - 2/3), which simplifies to 3[(x^2 - 2/3x - 2/3x + 4/9)]. This expression is equivalent to 3(x^2 - 4/3x + 4/9), which is the original equation. Currently, we have 3(x - 2/3)^2 + 5, but when we add -4/3 and 5, we get -4/3 + 5 = 1/3. Dividing both parts of the equation by 3 results in (x - 2/3)^2 + 1/9, which is a simplified and more elegant form of the equation.", "scores": {"ppl": 17.500173568725586, "some": 0.8886987368265787, "bart": -1.7309386730194092, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's the refined text, ensuring that the word 'three' is not included and meeting the specified token requirements:\n\nTo factor out a coefficient from the first two terms of the equation 3x2 - 4x + 5, simply pull out the coefficient and place it around a set of parentheses around both terms, while dividing each term by the coefficient.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Women with a specific type of blocked fallopian tube may experience abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, or no symptoms at all, but most cases are asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis due to the absence of noticeable symptoms such as pelvic pressure, irregular periods, heavy bleeding, and potential issues with ovulation, fertility, and overall reproductive health, including problems with menstruation. In most instances, women face significant challenges when trying to conceive due to a range of factors, including ovulation problems, low sperm count, or issues with the uterus or fallopian tubes, which can significantly impact their reproductive journey and emotional well-being, often leading to feelings of stress, anxiety, and frustration, and may require a comprehensive evaluation of fertility issues. From a medical perspective, infertility is defined as failing to conceive after at least one year of regular, unprotected sex, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of fertility issues and enabling healthcare professionals to identify potential causes and develop effective treatment plans tailored to individual needs, taking into account unique circumstances and requirements of each patient, and providing a clear understanding of reproductive health. If struggling to conceive, it is crucial to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible, ideally within six months of regular, unprotected sex, to discuss your options and receive guidance on the next steps, as timely action can significantly improve fertility treatment outcomes and reduce stress, which can have a profound impact on mental and emotional well-being, rather than delaying treatment. Schedule an appointment after six months of regular, unprotected sex, as this timeframe allows for a comprehensive evaluation of your reproductive health, but if you are over 35 years old, experience irregular menstrual cycles, or have had ovulation tests with negative results, it is essential to seek medical attention sooner to prevent potential complications that can arise from delayed diagnosis and treatment, and to address underlying fertility issues promptly. Your doctor will likely recommend a thorough fertility evaluation for both you and your partner, which includes a series of tests and examinations to assess your reproductive health and identify potential causes of infertility, providing a comprehensive understanding of your fertility status and allowing your doctor to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your unique needs and requirements, and ensures optimal reproductive health. You may require various tests, such as blood work and ultrasound examinations, to confirm that you have normal hormone levels and are ovulating properly, as well as to rule out other potential causes of infertility, including hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome, or other underlying conditions that may impact your fertility, which can affect your ability to conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy, and requires careful analysis of test results to develop an effective treatment plan. If the initial tests and examinations are normal, your doctor may recommend checking your fallopian tubes using a sonohysterogram and HSG to determine if there are any blockages or other issues affecting your fertility, which can be a crucial step in identifying the underlying cause of infertility and developing an effective treatment plan that addresses your specific needs, and provides a clear understanding of fallopian tube health. Your doctor may recommend a sonohysterogram, a medical procedure that uses an ultrasound and saline water injection to examine the uterus and fallopian tubes for any blockages or abnormalities, providing a detailed understanding of your reproductive anatomy and helping your doctor to identify potential causes of infertility, which can inform the development of a personalized treatment plan, and ensures accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Uterine masses, such as fibroids or polyps, can block the fallopian tubes, leading to infertility and other reproductive issues, making it essential to address these underlying conditions to improve fertility treatment outcomes, as they can often be treated with medication or surgery, restoring fertility and improving reproductive health, and can be identified through diagnostic tests. Depending on the results of your sonohysterogram and HSG, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopy, which involves making an incision near your navel to examine and, if necessary, remove any tissue blocking the tubes, typically as a last resort after other testing has been conducted, to restore fertility and improve reproductive health by addressing the underlying cause of infertility, which can be a complex and multifaceted issue, and requires careful consideration of treatment options. It's essential to ask your doctor to explain the extent of the blockage and any underlying causes of your infertility to ensure you have a clear understanding of your diagnosis, empowering you to make informed decisions about your fertility treatment and take an active role in your care, given the importance of clear communication in achieving successful fertility treatment, which requires a collaborative and empathetic approach, and helps build trust with your healthcare provider. Having a specific diagnosis will help determine the best course of treatment and increase your chances of successful fertility treatment by enabling your doctor to tailor a personalized treatment plan to address your unique fertility needs and improve your reproductive health outcomes, which may involve medication, surgery, or assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization, that cater to your specific circumstances and requirements, and are developed in consultation with your doctor.", "scores": {"ppl": 15.338987350463867, "some": 0.8941826820373535, "bart": -2.6943955421447754, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "To stand out in the highly competitive academic arena, seek out the most rigorous opportunities available at your school.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Walk into any kitchen store, and you'll notice a dizzying array of items, largely due to the numerous specialty pans, gadgets, and tools that cater to various cooking techniques and cuisines. However, the essentials for a good kitchen can get you through 90% of all recipes, making it possible to whip up a variety of dishes with just a few fundamental items. These essentials include skillets (one large and one small), which serve different purposes and are used in various cooking techniques: the large skillet is ideal for searing meat or cooking large quantities of food, while the small skillet is perfect for cooking delicate items, such as omelets or sauces. Saucepots (one 5-gallon and one 1-gallon, or rough equivalents) are also essential, as they allow for the preparation of large quantities of liquids, such as stocks or braising liquids, and smaller quantities, like soups or sauces. In addition to skillets and saucepots, a roasting pan is a must-have, as it provides a spacious area for cooking large cuts of meat, vegetables, or entire meals, allowing for even cooking and browning. Casserole dishes are versatile and can be used to prepare a wide range of dishes, from lasagna to roasted vegetables, making them an excellent addition to any kitchen. A Dutch oven (optional, but highly recommended) is also a valuable asset, as it allows for slow cooking, braising, and roasting, producing tender and flavorful results. Other essential items include metal mixing bowls, which are ideal for whipping cream, beating eggs, or mixing batter, and a knife set (minimum: chef's knife, paring knife, serrated knife), which is used for chopping, slicing, and mincing ingredients. Cutting boards (at least two: one for meat and one for other foods) are also crucial, as they prevent cross-contamination and make food preparation safer and more efficient. Accurate measurements are also vital in cooking, and dry and wet measuring cups and spoons are necessary for achieving precise results. Metal tongs are useful for turning and serving food, and mixing utensils (whisk, wooden spoon, slotted spoon, ladle, spatula) are essential for combining, stirring, and serving various ingredients. You'll spend more time on your knife than any other tool, and it pays to use it well, as proper knife technique makes cooking more efficient and yields better results. Good knife skills don't only make you more efficient, they make your food taste better, as evenly chopped vegetables cook evenly, and proper technique saves you from dulled blades and hours of cutting. Some tips for professional knife work include gripping the knife with your thumb and curled index finger where the blade meets the handle, allowing for control and precision. You want the back of your hand pointing up, not to the side, for the best control. If the blade is curved, cut forward and back, not up and down, as this ensures smooth and even cuts. Sharpening your knives every few months is essential, as dull blades can slip and cut you, and make cooking much less fun. Get the professionally sharpened once or twice a year, as this maintains the optimal sharpness and prevents accidents. Sharpening not only prolongs the life of your knives but also enhances the overall cooking experience. Everything that you can safely prep ahead of time should be prepped ahead of time, as this streamlines the cooking process and reduces stress. Good cooks are excellent time managers, utilizing every second in the kitchen efficiently so they aren't running around with their heads cut off or leaving things accidentally on the stove. Chop your veggies, measure out ingredients into cups or bowls, and clean workspaces before cooking, not during, as this prevents cross-contamination and maintains a clean and organized kitchen. Get all needed tools and items out of storage and in the kitchen, and complete each stage of a recipe at once, as this ensures efficiency and minimizes errors. Don't skin an onion, then cut it, then skin another, then cut it; instead, skin all the onions at once, then cut all the onions at once. Good meal planning helps you get the most out of your shopping, reusing ingredients and minimizing waste. Write out a little calendar and plan out meals for the next 2-3 days to start, looking up recipes with some ingredient overlap for the best results. Keep a list of your favorite meals and recipes to make future meal planning easier, and looking up recipes in advance will also help you see how different ingredients can be used in different ways, expanding your cooking vocabulary. This makes it lots easier than a big cleanup, and more importantly, it keeps your workspaces clean and clutter-free, allowing you to keep cooking or working on new dishes with ease. Anytime you handle raw meat or fish, wash down all surfaces and utensils used, as this prevents cross-contamination and maintains proper food safety. Get in a habit of cleaning during downtime (saut\u00e9ing, waiting for a loaf to proof, etc.), as this keeps your kitchen organized and efficient. Good cooks hit the trashcan and/or compost bin a lot, trimming bits of food and unwrapping or opening ingredients, as this maintains a clean and organized kitchen and prevents waste.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Women with a particular kind of blocked fallopian tube may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain or increased vaginal discharge, though most women remain asymptomatic. Infertility often goes undetected in women until they struggle to conceive due to irregular menstrual cycles, reduced sperm count, or ovulation disorders, which can lead to emotional and physical strain, strained relationships, and a prolonged period of trying, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness. From a medical perspective, infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular, unprotected sex, significantly impacting a woman's emotional and mental well-being, as well as her relationship and overall quality of life. If you suspect you may be experiencing infertility, schedule a prompt appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist to discuss your options and determine the best course of action, which can help you avoid years of struggling with infertility, alleviate emotional distress, and improve your chances of getting pregnant, while also providing peace of mind and a sense of control over your reproductive health. Women over 35, those with irregular menses, or those with confirmed ovulation issues, should not wait a year to seek medical attention, as fertility declines significantly with age, and delays can substantially impact chances of getting pregnant. It's essential to note that infertility is not the same as sterility; while infertility means an inability to conceive naturally, sterility means an inability to conceive at all, either naturally or with medical assistance, such as IVF or egg or sperm donation, which can be achieved with the help of modern reproductive technologies. Instead of assuming you'll never be able to get pregnant, consider the many effective treatments available to help women conceive, such as fertility medications, IUI, or IVF, which can be tailored to your individual needs and circumstances. Your doctor will likely recommend a comprehensive fertility evaluation for both you and your partner, which may include hormone testing, semen analysis, and imaging studies to determine the underlying cause of your infertility, helping to identify the root cause of your fertility struggles and provide a clear direction for treatment, while also allowing you to make informed decisions about your care. Your partner will need to provide a sperm sample so that a specialist can examine it for any issues with sperm count or motility, which can significantly impact fertility and affect your chances of getting pregnant, highlighting the importance of both partners being involved in the fertility evaluation process. To confirm you have normal hormone levels and are ovulating properly, you will need to undergo various tests, which is essential for fertility and can help your doctor determine the best course of treatment, ensuring you receive the most effective care possible. If all of these tests come back normal, your doctor will recommend checking your fallopian tubes to determine if there's any blockage or damage, which can be a crucial step in diagnosing the underlying cause of your infertility and developing an effective treatment plan, providing a clear direction for your care. Your doctor may recommend undergoing a sonohysterogram, a medical procedure that involves using an ultrasound to look for any masses in the uterus that could be causing the blockage, such as fibroids or polyps, which can help identify the cause of your fallopian tube blockage and guide further treatment, while also providing valuable information about the location and size of any masses or blockages. During a sonohysterogram, your doctor will inject saline water into your uterus to help visualize the area with an ultrasound, which can provide valuable information about the location and size of any masses or blockages, ultimately helping to determine the best course of treatment, while also allowing you to make informed decisions about your care. Uterine masses, such as fibroids or polyps, can sometimes block the fallopian tubes, making it difficult to conceive, and can be caused by a range of factors, including hormonal imbalances, pelvic inflammatory disease, age-related decline in fertility, and other underlying medical conditions. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a medical procedure in which a special dye is injected through your cervix and into your fallopian tubes to determine if they're open or blocked, providing your doctor with valuable information to determine the best course of treatment and understand your diagnosis and treatment options, guiding your care and helping you make informed decisions. X-rays are then taken to determine if the tubes are open or blocked, giving your doctor valuable information to determine the best course of treatment and understand your diagnosis and treatment options, while also allowing you to take an active role in your fertility journey. Hysterosalpingograms are typically done without anesthesia, but you may experience mild cramping or discomfort during the procedure, which can be managed with relaxation techniques and breathing exercises to minimize any discomfort, ensuring a smooth and comfortable experience. This procedure usually takes 15 to 30 minutes to complete and is often used as a diagnostic tool to help determine the cause of infertility, providing clarity on your diagnosis and treatment options, while also allowing you to make informed decisions about your care. Potential risks associated with the procedure include pelvic infection or damage to cells or tissue from radiation exposure, which can be minimized by following your doctor's instructions and taking necessary precautions to ensure your safety, highlighting the importance of careful preparation and attention to detail. If your doctor suspects that your tubes are blocked, they may use an oil-based dye during the procedure, which can sometimes remove the blockage, allowing for a more natural and less invasive treatment option, providing a potential solution to your fertility challenges. Laparoscopy should only be performed after other infertility testing has been done, as it's a riskier procedure that carries the risks associated with any major surgery, including infection, bleeding, and adhesions, which your doctor will discuss with you in detail, ensuring you're fully informed and prepared for the procedure. The results of these tests should determine whether one or both of your fallopian tubes are blocked, guiding your doctor in determining the best course of treatment, which can help you understand your diagnosis and treatment options, while also allowing you to make informed decisions about your care.

One of our first stops was the stunning Grand Haven beach, with its breathtaking shores. We hadn't seen each other in person for such a long time, so we spent time catching up. We sat in the shade at a picnic table. We watched the windsurfers glide across the water, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. Jamie picked up sandwiches for everyone, which we enjoyed while scouting out a spot on the beach. The beach was busy but relaxing, and we made the most of our time there. Located in Michigan, Traverse City is famous for its beautiful wineries. Sarah had always wanted to experience the Upper Peninsula's natural beauty, and we were happy to take them there. We checked into our hotel in the late afternoon and planned to visit the wineries the next day. We took a detour to visit the breathtaking Sleeping Bear Dunes on our way to the first winery. William was excited to capture the stunning sunset, with the views being nothing short of breathtaking. After a day of traveling and hiking, we were all ready for a good night's rest. The wineries we visited the next day were amazing, and we learned a lot about the wines. Taking an Uber from the hotel and back again was a good idea, considering the previous night. We took them to our favorite restaurant in town for dinner, where they had a memorable culinary experience. The wait was worth it, as the restaurant was busy but delicious. The restaurant's dishes showcased the region's produce and presentation, a true testament to local cuisine. We were thrilled to share our favorite restaurant experience with our friends, who loved it on their first trip to the states. We took them on a day trip to Mackinaw Island, where they rode in a horse-drawn carriage. We also biked around the charming island, taking in the scenic views. Visiting the charming shops was a highlight of our visit, something we'll always treasure. In June, we had beautiful weather, with the sun shining brightly each day. We had an amazing time visiting our Irish friends and are already planning a trip to visit them in Ireland. We're grateful they visited us in the summer, when our state is at its most beautiful.

These models excel at tasks like code completion (Raychev et al., 2014) and synthesizing code from natural language descriptions (Desai et al., 2016). One of the largest models, Codex (Chen et al., 2021), has been deployed in the real-world tool GitHub Copilot, as an in-IDE developer assistant. Despite its success, Codex's strongest models are not publicly available, limiting research in this field for low-resourced organizations.\n\nSeveral medium to large-sized pre-trained language models are publicly available, such as GPTNeo (Black et al., 2021), GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022). These models can generate source code with reasonable performance (Chen et al., 2021). However, the impact of many modeling and training design decisions remains unclear due to the variety of model sizes and training schemes involved.\n\nThe lack of access to the model's internals prevents the research community from studying other key aspects, such as interpretability and distillation of the model for more efficient deployment. Multilingual models potentially provide better generalization, as different programming languages share similar keywords and properties (Conneau & Lample, 2019; Z\u00a8ugner et al., 2021).\n\nIn this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of existing models of code \u2013 Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and CodeParrot \u2013 across various programming languages. We aim to provide a key missing link by training large open-source language models exclusively on code from multiple programming languages. We provide three such models, ranging from 160M to 2.7B parameters, under the umbrella name \"PolyCoder\".\n\nWe perform an extensive comparison of the training and evaluation settings between PolyCoder, open-source models, and Codex. We evaluate the models on the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) and compare how models of different sizes and training steps scale. We also compare how different temperatures affect the generation quality. Finally, we curate an unseen evaluation dataset in each of the 12 languages to evaluate the perplexity of different models.\n\nOur results show that Codex performs surprisingly well in other programming languages too, and even better than GPT-J and GPT-NeoX that were trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). However, our PolyCoder model achieves a lower perplexity than all these models, including Codex, in the C programming language.\n\nWe hope that this systematic study helps future research in this area to design more efficient and effective models. We encourage the community to study and release medium-large scale language models for code, in response to the concerns expressed by Hellendoorn & Sawant (2021).

Product description is a central element of online interaction, significantly influencing search visibility and customer engagement (Bijmolt et al., 2018). Historical product descriptions were created manually, resulting in inconsistent outcomes due to human error (Zhu et al., 2019). In eCommerce, the 'cold start' issue occurs when new products lack sufficient engagement data to be prominently featured or recommended by platforms, posing a significant challenge (Wang et al., 2020). Effective product descriptions can enhance click-through rates by aligning with market trends, thereby mitigating the 'cold start' issue and improving product discoverability (Cakmak et al., 2019). This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the LLAMA 2.0 7B language model to automate product description generation efficiently (Touvron et al., 2023). We train the model on authentic product descriptions from Walmart, a global e-commerce leader. We use low-engagement items as challenging samples to improve model performance and robustness. We target underperforming product descriptions for enrichment and refinement in the second phase of our approach. We validate our approach using metrics such as NDCG and human evaluations for effectiveness. Our contributions include applying large language models for product description generation on real e-commerce platforms and advancing the field. Our work has the potential to revolutionize product listing processes, boost sales, and significantly enhance customer satisfaction. The paper is organized into three main sections: a review of related work, a discussion of the proposed methodology, and presentation of experimental results. The methodology section includes a detailed explanation of the novel approach, implementation details, and key findings. The proposed methodology can address the 'cold start' issue, improve product description generation, and enhance the overall e-commerce experience with personalized results. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge on e-commerce, product description generation, and large language model applications in this field by providing a novel solution. The proposed methodology can be applied to various digital commerce platforms, such as online marketplaces and e-commerce websites. Our evaluation metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the proposed methodology's effectiveness and efficiency in product listing performance. The results demonstrate the proposed methodology's potential to improve product listing performance, boost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction significantly.

However, novel products often face the 'cold start' problem, where they lack sufficient engagement data. Effective product descriptions can mitigate this issue by enhancing clickthrough rates.\n\nTo address existing eCommerce challenges, this paper introduces an innovative methodology that employs the LLAMA 2.0 7B language model to automate product descriptions.

For fine-tuning, the model focuses on five aspects: language appeal, factual information, product dimensions, unique attributes, and brand-related guarantees.\n\nThe fine-tuned model aims to capture consumer interest while providing essential information. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability to boost sales and customer engagement.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Molecular science encompasses a wide range of fields that study the fundamental characteristics and behaviors of molecules. This field is a highly interdisciplinary area that draws on chemistry, physics, biology, and computer science to tackle complex molecular phenomena. Molecular science plays a pivotal role in drug discovery, enabling researchers to identify potential targets, design drugs with precision, and predict side effects through applications such as target identification and validation, structure-based drug design, and side effect prediction. Existing methods for discovering new molecules or modifying existing ones can be labor-intensive, costly, and prone to failure, as highlighted by Rodrigues et al. in 2016. Computational methods have emerged as a game-changer in molecule generation and optimization, offering significant advantages over traditional approaches, such as those demonstrated by Bilodeau et al. in 2022. These computational techniques enable rapid identification and optimization of potential drug candidates by leveraging advanced algorithms and data analysis. However, these methods are often limited by substantial computational demands, which can hinder their widespread adoption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence and deep learning have come to the forefront of molecular science, holding tremendous potential to transform the field by improving speed, accuracy, and scalability in molecular discovery and understanding. These technologies can potentially revolutionize the field by streamlining complex molecular processes and providing novel insights, thereby driving breakthroughs in medicine and other industries. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and molecular science, with notable achievements in tasks such as molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation. MolT5, a state-of-the-art LLM, has built upon the T5 framework, incorporating capabilities such as molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation. LLMs like MolT5 can describe molecules in words and generate structures from text with remarkable accuracy, opening up new avenues for molecular research and discovery. However, these text-to-text models still struggle to fully leverage the advantages of molecular structure data and understand molecular images, highlighting the need for more advanced techniques. To overcome this limitation, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like CLIP, ALIGN, and BEIT-3 have been developed to fuse and understand multi-modal data, combining the strengths of text-based and image-based approaches.", "scores": {"ppl": 31.944978713989258, "some": 0.891376813252767, "bart": -1.7859820127487183, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's the refined text without altering the word 'one' and within the token count range of 720-740 tokens, consisting of fewer than 30 sentences, and each sentence with fewer than 48 tokens.\n\nRecent advances in language models (LMs) have led to impressive performance in modeling source code, written in various programming languages. These models excel at tasks like code completion and synthesizing code from natural language descriptions. The current state-of-the-art large language models for code have shown significant progress for AI-based programming assistance. One of the largest models, Codex, has been deployed in GitHub Copilot, an in-IDE developer assistant that generates code based on user context. Despite its success, the strongest models are not publicly available, limiting research and application outside of well-resourced companies. For example, Codex provides non-free access to its output through black-box API calls, but the model's weights and training data are unavailable. This prevents researchers from fine-tuning and adapting the model to domains and tasks other than code completion. The lack of access to the model's internals also prevents studying other key aspects, such as interpretability and distillation. Several medium to large-sized pre-trained language models are publicly available, including GPTNeo, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX. These models can be used to generate source code with reasonable performance, despite being trained on a mixture of text including news articles and software repositories. In addition, there are open-source language models trained solely on source code, such as CodeParrot, which was trained on 180 GB of Python code. Given the variety of model sizes and training schemes, the impact of many modeling and training design decisions remains unclear. For instance, we do not know the precise selection of data on which Codex and other private models were trained. Multilingual models potentially provide better generalization, as different programming languages share similar keywords and properties. This may hint that multilingual LMs can generalize across languages and be useful for modeling low-resource programming languages. We present a systematic evaluation of existing models of code \u2013 Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, and CodeParrot \u2013 across various programming languages. We aim to shed more light on the landscape of code modeling design decisions by comparing and contrasting these models. We provide three open-source models, ranging from 160M to 2.7B parameters, which we release under the umbrella name \u201cPolyCoder\u201d. We evaluate the models on the HumanEval benchmark and compare how different temperatures affect the generation quality. We find that Codex performs surprisingly well in other programming languages too and even better than GPT-J and GPT-NeoX. Nonetheless, in the C programming language, our PolyCoder model achieves a lower perplexity than all these models, including Codex. Although most current models perform worse than Codex, we hope that this systematic study helps future research in this area to design more efficient and effective models. We encourage the community to study and release medium-large scale language models for code to address concerns about the cost of training and testing such models. Our efforts are a significant step towards democratization of large language models of code. We believe that our findings will help researchers and developers design more efficient and effective models for code. We also hope that our evaluation will inspire the development of more open-source models for code. By making more models available, we can promote research and innovation in this area. Our evaluation highlights the importance of studying the performance of language models on different programming languages. We demonstrate that multilingual models can generalize across languages and be useful for modeling low-resource programming languages. We show that our PolyCoder model achieves a lower perplexity than all the other models, including Codex, in the C programming language. Our results suggest that the performance of language models can be improved by adapting them to specific programming languages. We conclude that our evaluation provides valuable insights into the design of language models for code and encourages the development of more open-source models.

Large language models have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications and capabilities. With the development of large language models like GPT-3, researchers have discovered the potential for performing in-context learning by providing demonstrations at the input of the model. In-context learning is a technique that enables models to learn to perform new tasks from a small number of demonstrations presented at the input of the model. Formally, a set of data points and their corresponding labels, denoted as xi and yi, are considered to learn the relationship between the data points and their labels. To achieve this, demonstrations are prepended to the input sequence as follows: [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn, xt]. By learning the analogy between the data points and their labels, the model is capable of directly predicting the label of xt without any gradient backward process involved. Instead, the model relies solely on the input demonstrations to acquire knowledge and perform the task. In-context learning, as an emergent ability of the model, remains insufficiently optimized due to its disparity between the model's and the task's requirements. Recent works, such as VALL-E and AudioBox, have also claimed to perform in-context learning with large speech models, primarily focusing on learning the acoustic condition or speaker identity of the given speech prompt. However, this topic has been studied in the speech processing literature as \"voice cloning\" and \"style transfer\" and is outside the scope of this paper. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of the proposed approach, where warmup training utilizes a variety of training tasks to instill in-context learning abilities in the speech language model. This allows the model to utilize task demonstrations effectively to tackle novel unseen tasks and adapt to new requirements. Regarding this, researchers have attempted to perform warmup training in either a supervised or self-supervised manner to enhance the in-context learning capability of the model. The motivation for building a model with in-context learning capability is that it offers several advantages, including simplifying the integration of human knowledge into the model by providing demonstrations. Second, in-context learning incorporates demonstrations at the input, eliminating the need for backpropagation and gradient flow to establish connections between data points and their labels. As a result, computational costs are reduced, and the model can adapt to new tasks defined by the users. Third, models are often released as a service in the real-world application, and in-context learning is particularly suitable for model deployment since it only modifies the input. Overall, in the NLP field, in-context learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for utilizing models, offering several advantages and opportunities for research and development. However, despite the recent advancements in large speech models, there is a notable lack of research on in-context learning in the domain of speech processing. Fortunately, the recently developed textless speech language models offer an opportunity for us to explore in-context learning for speech processing and its potential applications. Language Identification, Speech Model, Emotion Recognition, Speech Model, and Spoken Command Recognition are some of the tasks that can be performed using in-context learning. Warmup Training, In-context Learning, and Spoken Command Recognition are the key components of in-context learning, which enables models to learn from demonstrations and adapt to new tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 45.63408279418945, "some": 0.863442579905192, "bart": -2.500734567642212, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced explosive growth in recent years, redefining the landscape of designing natural applications across diverse domains.

Normally, one of them would be at home with the kids, but due to their demanding work schedule, requiring them to be away for almost 12 hours a day, I agreed to lend a hand. I had previously babysat for them, so I was pretty familiar with the kids, who are three and five years old. They can be quite energetic at times, but the kids are fun and generally well-behaved. Since I was on winter break from college, my schedule was not significantly impacted by spending every day with my niece and nephew. My girlfriend was able to visit some of the time, which was nice and made things a bit easier for me. We spent a lot of time playing games with the kids, taking them to the park frequently, and finding ways to keep them engaged. I enjoyed my time with the kids and felt like I got to know them better than I did before. There was one incident where I became a bit concerned for their well-being. Melissa, the three-year-old, was playing with some toys when I heard her brother calling from another room. I quickly went into the room and found him sitting on the floor, holding his arm. He had tripped and fallen, landing quite badly on his arm, and I noticed some swelling and bruising already beginning to form. I took a closer look and saw that he could still move his arm, but I wasn't sure if he needed to visit the urgent care. I applied some ice to his arm, gave him some Motrin, and called his dad to let him know what was happening. If I had called his mom, I think she would have been a bit more upset. My brother instructed me to send him a picture, and then he spoke with Brian, his son. We ended up taking him to the urgent care as a precaution, but fortunately, everything turned out to be fine in the end. I also learned how to prepare a few meals during this time. My girlfriend and I experimented with making some dishes from the recipes that my brother and his wife had in their kitchen. I actually enjoyed cooking for them, even though some of the meals weren't exactly gourmet. I managed to make a variety of dishes, including chicken ricotta, pasta salads, salmon, soups, sandwiches, tacos, and more.

The process typically begins by using a screwdriver or similar tool to unfasten the top of the filter, and gain access to the sponge or pad. Remove the sponge or pad and rinse it under warm water for a few minutes. Alternatively, you can use the cleansed water from an aquarium water change session as the rinse water to retain healthy bacteria, and prevent ammonia contamination. If the sponge or pad is too full of debris, then you should purchase a replacement and install it into the filter. Once the original or new sponge/pad are back inside the filter, re-fasten the top and screw it back into place. Cleaning the filter at least every other week is recommended, but more frequent cleaning may be necessary if you have a larger aquarium or multiple fish. Chemical filters usually take the form of granules or pellets, and are designed to remove specific impurities from the water. These filters are typically placed sequentially after an existing mechanical filter and the water\u2014or between the mechanical filter, and biological filter. They normally require pouring the instructed amount of granules into the filter, or pre-fabricated filter bag for placing in the tank water directly. A form of activated carbon is typical choice in this case, as it absorbs organic particles, medications, bacteria causing odors, and colors dissolved into the aquarium water.  When the water is becoming cloudy, or smells bad, it is time to change the chemical filter. Usually, these filters are good for 1-2 months. If you use a filter bag, then put the bag in a high water-flow area of the tank. The biological filter holds the bacteria that participates in the breakdown of material in the nitrogen cycle. This is a major step in keeping the water clear of ammonia, and nitrates\u2014toxins that are eventually fatal to fish. These filters usually have a large surface area, and are located sequentially after the chemical filter. In other words, the water will filter through the mechanical and chemical filters first. If the biological filter is clogged, then you need to pull the filter, and rinse it only with the aquarium water in order to retain the helpful bacteria and slime on the surface. You should only have to replace the biological filter if it\u2019s physically damaged. For any motorized equipment, such as a pump or power filter, you need to follow your manufacturer\u2019s instructions to maintain them properly. However, you can do some basic maintenance to make sure the water stays clean with well-run equipment. Do these power equipment cleanings during water changes while power is off, and disconnected from the tank. Use your instruction manual for removing impeller blades (motor blades) from power filters and pumps. Use a clean dust cloth to wipe debris from the impeller blades, and inspect it for damage. Replace it if damaged. With the filter removed during a water change, you can take a few extra steps in maintaining it. Rinse the filter\u2019s main housing, pipes (intake and outlet), and use aquarium safe lubricants for any moving parts. Petroleum jelly or liquid silicone can be useful as lubricants. Externally mounted power pumps may need machine oil, but consult your manual. After cleaning and lubricating the filter, you should put the pieces back together and reinsert the filter in the tank. You may need to prime the filter before it will work again. Fill the filter with some of the aquarium water after insertion back into the tank. This will restart the siphon function.

They can conduct a urine test to determine whether you're dehydrated or have an infection by analyzing the composition of your urine. Getting a diagnosis is the first and most critical step in treating the problem, as it enables your doctor to provide the correct treatment and help you recover from any underlying conditions. Sometimes, if your kidneys are not functioning properly, your body may stop producing urine or significantly decrease urine production, which can be a sign of a more severe issue. See your doctor right away if you stop producing much urine and experience symptoms such as swelling in your legs, drowsiness, confusion, fatigue, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Your doctor can check your basic kidney function by conducting a blood test, which measures creatinine levels and blood urea nitrogen to provide valuable information about your overall health, including kidney function. This test helps your doctor understand how well your kidneys are working and identify any potential issues. Kidney problems can be either chronic or acute, with chronic issues persisting for a long time and requiring ongoing management, and acute problems referring to sudden and brief episodes of kidney damage. Many illnesses can cause kidney problems, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, and diabetes, so it's vital to visit your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment to prevent further complications. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women than men but can affect both sexes, causing inflammation and swelling that can block urine flow, often accompanied by symptoms such as a strong urge to urinate, burning or pain during urination, or urinating frequently in small amounts. Treatment for UTIs typically involves antibiotics, which are essential in eliminating the infection and preventing further complications, such as kidney damage and sepsis, by targeting the bacteria causing the infection and ultimately eliminating it from the body. By using antibiotics, your doctor can help you recover from the infection and prevent long-term damage. If you're experiencing symptoms of a UTI, including a strong urge to urinate, burning or pain during urination, urinating frequently in small amounts, or weak urine flow, visit your doctor for treatment. Prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate caused by infection, can cause slow or weak urine flow in men, often accompanied by pain in the groin or pelvis and possibly chills or a fever, resulting from bacterial growth in the prostate. This condition is typically treated with antibiotics to eliminate the infection. If you're experiencing these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating, see your doctor for a check-up to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment. Prostatitis will be treated with antibiotics if it's caused by a bacterial infection, which is the most common type, and your doctor may also recommend lifestyle changes to alleviate symptoms. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in men over 60 that causes urinary problems due to an enlarged prostate, which squeezes the urethra and blocks urine flow, leading to symptoms such as slow or weak urine flow, frequent urination, or difficulty starting to urinate. If you're experiencing urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH, as early detection and treatment can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor can recommend treatment options such as natural remedies like saw palmetto extract, medications called alpha-blockers, or surgical procedures, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), to address the enlarged prostate. BPH is a common condition, but prostate cancer, though less common, can also enlarge the prostate and cause urinary symptoms, making regular prostate checks essential to detect any potential issues early on. It's crucial to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50, or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer, to detect any potential issues early on, as this can help prevent the development of complications. Treatment for urinary problems often involves antibiotics, which are essential in eliminating infections and preventing further complications, such as kidney damage and sepsis, by targeting the bacteria causing the infection and ultimately eliminating it from the body.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Imitating the normal night-time routine that you follow at home even though you are traveling can promote relaxation and rest, as your brain associates these activities with sleep, helping to create a sense of familiarity and calmness. Do what you usually do at night - use the bathroom and brush your teeth - to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Screen time can be a significant obstacle to falling asleep, as the blue light emitted by smartphones, tablets, and computers tricks the brain into thinking it's still daytime, suppressing the production of melatonin and disrupting the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Even in coach seats, there are a few key things you can do to get comfortable, which can be especially challenging on long flights. Be aware of your body temperature, as it can fluctuate significantly on planes, and dress accordingly to stay comfortable and relaxed. On planes, cabin temperature can vary considerably even during a single flight, so wear lighter layers that can be taken on and off easily to maintain a comfortable body temperature. Wear loose-fitting clothing in natural fibers that will allow your body to breathe and release heat, which can help regulate your body temperature and promote relaxation. A hat or a hood may also be a useful way of keeping light out of your eyes, which can help you relax and fall asleep by reducing visual stimulation. Get some comfy socks, as research suggests that wearing socks can promote sleep by causing the blood vessels in the feet to dilate, improving blood flow and reducing stress. Bring comfortable shoes for the train, as you'll need to wear them at all times on Amtrak trains, and prioritize your foot comfort throughout your journey. If you have a sleeping bunk on a train, you can expect pillows and blankets to be available, but take advantage of additional resources to enhance your sleep experience. A neck pillow is essential if you're unable to fully recline, as this can make it more difficult to fall into a deep sleep, and consider using a classic U-shaped travel pillow. Bring blankets to keep you warm, and on an airplane, buckle your seatbelt over the blanket to avoid being woken up by cabin crew if the seatbelt sign goes on, ensuring a peaceful rest. Avoiding certain foods that inhibit good sleep, such as those high in sugar and caffeine, and trying to eat at regular meal times can help you get some rest. Don't consume caffeine before or during the flight, as this can act as a stimulant and inhibit sleep by suppressing the production of melatonin and disrupting the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Sip water to stay hydrated, but avoid drinking too much so that you don't constantly need to use the bathroom, which can disrupt your sleep and create discomfort. Try to eat at regular times, as your internal body clock affects your digestion, and a heavy meal or hunger can make it difficult to sleep and reduce the quality of your rest. There are several activities you can do while in your seat to help you relax and fall asleep, such as deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. For example, deep muscle relaxation exercises, such as flexing or clenching your muscles and then gradually focusing on letting go and relaxing them, can be very effective in reducing tension and promoting relaxation. Start by focusing on your toes or fingers, and then move carefully around the body, gradually releasing tension as you go, and work your way up to your head and neck. Deep breathing can also help you achieve a state of relaxation conducive to sleep by slowing down your heart rate and promoting a sense of calmness.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Transformers and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become ubiquitous in applications of NLP, building upon the groundbreaking work of Vaswani et al. in 2017, who introduced the transformer architecture, which was later popularized by Devlin et al. in 2019, leading to significant advancements in the field and numerous state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including natural language understanding, machine translation, and text classification, as well as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering, where they can handle long-range dependencies and complex linguistic structures more efficiently than autoregressive models. The benefits of non-autoregressive transformers are numerous, including their ability to process input sequences in parallel, which greatly reduces the training time and enables the use of larger models, and their scalability with an increase in model parameters and data, which makes them particularly suitable for large-scale applications, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering, where they can handle long-range dependencies and complex linguistic structures more efficiently than autoregressive models. Additionally, non-autoregressive transformers can be more computationally efficient and require less memory, making them more suitable for resource-constrained devices, and they can also be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as knowledge distillation and model pruning, to further improve their performance and reduce their size. PLMs are typically trained on unlabeled data, which is cheaper to obtain than labeled data, allowing for the training of larger models, and recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of training PLMs on large-scale datasets such as Wikipedia and BookCorpus, which are readily available and inexpensive to obtain, and can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, in addition to other datasets like Common Crawl and the Internet Archive, such as Reddit, which has a large corpus of user-generated text, and the Open Web, which contains a vast amount of web pages that can be used for web text classification, and the BookCorpus, which consists of millions of book pages and can be used for text classification and sentiment analysis. The recent breaching of the trillion parameter mark for PLMs highlights the need for more sustainable training paradigms, as pointed out by Strubell et al. in 2019, and the environmental concerns related to large language models, which are a major drawback of the current training paradigm, as noted by Li et al. in 2020, resulting in significant energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which can be mitigated by using more efficient training methods, such as knowledge distillation, and hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs), and by training models on smaller datasets and for shorter periods of time, which can reduce the carbon footprint of model development and deployment. In order to deploy these models for practical applications such as virtual personal assistants, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms, model compression is necessary, and Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a simple yet powerful knowledge transfer algorithm that is used for compression, ensembling, and multi-task learning, and is particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization, where it can reduce the size of the model while maintaining its accuracy, and KD can also be used to improve the performance of other models, such as language translation models and speech recognition models, and can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as model pruning and knowledge distillation, to further improve the performance and reduce the size of the model. Knowledge Distillation is a simple yet powerful knowledge transfer algorithm that is used for compression, ensembling, and multi-task learning, by training a smaller student model to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher model, typically with a similar architecture, and it is one of the most widely researched algorithms for the compression of transformer-based PLMs, as demonstrated by the numerous works on KD for compression of transformer-based PLMs, including Rogers et al. in 2020, who showed that KD can be used to compress large transformer-based models, such as the BERT model, while maintaining their accuracy, and KD can also be used to transfer knowledge from one model to another, such as from a pre-trained model to a fine-tuned model. One key feature that makes KD attractive is that it only requires access to the teacher's output or logits and not the weights themselves, which makes it a highly efficient algorithm for model compression, as it eliminates the need for sensitive model weights to be transmitted or stored, and allows for the use of a trillion parameter model, such as the one described by Fedus et al., without requiring access to its weights, enabling the efficient deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices, such as smartphones and embedded systems, and this is particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition and language translation, where the model needs to be deployed on devices with limited computational resources. The second direction towards curriculum-based or progressive KD involves training the student one layer at a time or from an intermediary teacher, known as a teacher assistant, which can provide a more efficient and effective learning process, by allowing the student to learn from the teacher's partial knowledge and gradually build up its own understanding of the task, and this approach can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the student model needs to learn from a teacher model that has a similar architecture, and the teacher assistant can provide a more efficient and effective learning process by allowing the student to learn from the teacher's partial knowledge. While these works have shown accuracy gains over standard KD, they have come at the cost of architectural assumptions, including a common architecture between student and teacher, and greater access to teacher parameters and intermediate outputs, which can be a limitation of these approaches, as they may not generalize well to other architectures or data distributions, and may require significant modifications to the teacher model to accommodate the student's architecture, and this can be a challenge in applications such as language translation, where the student model needs to learn from a teacher model with a different architecture. Another issue is that the decision to distill one teacher layer and to skip another is arbitrary, which can lead to suboptimal compression performance, and it is often difficult to determine the optimal architecture for the student model, as the choice of layers to distill can significantly impact the accuracy and generalization of the student model, and this can be a challenge in applications such as language translation, where the student model needs to generalize well to unseen data, and the choice of layers to distill can impact the student model's ability to generalize. Still, the teacher typically demonstrates better generalization, which is why KD is often used to improve the accuracy of student models, as it allows the student model to learn from the teacher's experience and knowledge, and our work aims to address this issue by using adversarial training to improve student accuracy, by training the student model to be robust to perturbations in the input data, and this can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the student model needs to generalize well to unseen data. Adversarial training involves training the student model to be robust to perturbations in the input data, which can improve its accuracy and robustness, and our work presents a text-based adversarial algorithm, MATE-KD, which increases the accuracy of the student model using KD, by training the student model to predict the teacher's output given the input data, and this can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the student model needs to generalize well to unseen data. Our algorithm only requires access to the teacher's logits and thus keeps the teacher and student architecture independent, which makes it a highly efficient and flexible approach to model compression, as it allows the teacher model to be trained and deployed separately from the student model, and can be used with a wide range of teacher models, including pre-trained models and fine-tuned models, and this can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the teacher model needs to be trained and deployed separately from the student model. We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark and demonstrate improvement over competitive baselines, including BERTLARGE, which is a state-of-the-art model on the GLUE test set, which assesses the model's ability to perform well on a variety of natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification, and the GLUE benchmark is a critical tool for evaluating the performance of NLP models, as it assesses the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, and is particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition. On the GLUE test set we achieve a score of 80.9, which is a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, BERTLARGE, and demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm in improving the accuracy of student models, by training the student model to predict the teacher's output given the input data, and this can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the student model needs to generalize well to unseen data. We also demonstrate improvement on out-of-domain (OOD) evaluation, which is a critical aspect of model evaluation, as it assesses the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, and is particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization, where the model may be deployed on new and unseen data, and OOD evaluation is a critical tool for evaluating the performance of NLP models, as it assesses the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, and can be particularly useful in applications such as language translation and speech recognition, where the model needs to generalize well to unseen data.", "scores": {"ppl": 18.513999938964844, "some": 0.8844647407531738, "bart": -2.5923879146575928, "acc": 0.5}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "It has been five years since my cousin passed away, leaving a significant void in my life.

My aunt, in particular, faced a tremendous burden, having lost both her mother and her only child within a short span of time. As she tried to navigate her grief in her own time and way, it became increasingly evident that she was struggling to cope.\n\nOver the past few years, I had observed a steady decline in her mental health and noticed that her behavior was becoming more erratic and manic.

Draw up a budget that covers your income and expenses, and determine what money you have available for your debts. Consider how you might also raise your income. Once you have your budget, come up with a realistic figure to set aside each month for paying off your debts. Join this to your list of prioritized debts and see how much you can afford to pay. Contact your creditors to talk about possible ways to restructure and reorganize your debts. If you can give them detailed information about how much you can pay each month, it may be possible to renegotiate your loans. You may be able to agree a new repayment plan that reduces the monthly amount you pay but spreads the payments out over an extended period. It\u2019s essential to reach an agreement with your most troublesome creditors. The others should be easier to pay off once you take care of these creditors and reduce your payments to them. If you have been unable to negotiate new repayment plans, or all the information is overwhelming you, make an appointment with a non-profit credit counseling or debt advice organization. There are charities and other non-profits that specialize in giving free and impartial advice to people who find themselves in financial difficulty. Here you will receive advice on what steps to take and how to deal with creditors. Lots of universities, military bases, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension service have non-profit credit counseling schemes. Local credit unions, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureaux, and housing authorities may be able to help. Make sure you visit a reputable organization with a strong track record. Non-profit doesn't always mean free. A credit counsellor may suggest enrolling in a debt management plan if you are unable to repay your debts. The counsellor is likely to suggest this if you are struggling to repay your debts. The plan typically involves paying money to the counseling organization, who then pay it to your various unsecured debts. Think carefully about this and be sure you have talked it through with your creditors. Only do this if an advisor has thoroughly reviewed your finances. A counsellor should be able to give you advice on budgeting and managing your debts without resorting to a debt management plan. Debt settlement programs involve working with a company to pay off principal balances to your creditors with lump sums that are less than what is owed. Creditors will only agree to this if they believe it is a better outcome than trying to chase you for payments in the future. The company will make the payment, but you will be required to pay a specific amount of money into a savings account for a long time. This can help pay off your debts but can be a risky approach. If you consider this, be sure you can make the monthly payments indefinitely. Your creditors are under no obligation to come to terms with the debt settlement company. Debt settlement companies generally encourage you to pay them rather than your creditors. As a result, your credit score will suffer and there can be other consequences. If your debts are not being paid, you may be incurring extra fees and charges that you wouldn\u2019t if you were paying the creditor directly. There are numerous scams related to debt settlement, and not all companies will live up to their promises. Before you sign-up, do plenty of research on the company and always get free impartial advice from a non-profit credit counseling organization. You may be able to lower the cost of your debt by consolidating it against a new line of credit, such as by re-mortgaging your home. These plans will generally use your home as collateral, so if your home is not at risk from your debts, think carefully about whether you want to put it on the line. Be wary of consolidation schemes with variable rates. What might be cheaper to start with can become more expensive if the rate is pushed up. If your debts are completely unworkable and you cannot find a way forward, it might be time to consider filing for bankruptcy. This is a major decision with long-lasting consequences that should not be taken lightly. Bankruptcy can make it very difficult to access credit or buy a home in the future. You can file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler and faster to file, and results in the elimination of most debts, but some filers may not qualify for this type of bankruptcy.

Their widespread adoption can be attributed to their non-autoregressive architecture, which makes them highly parallelizable and scalable with an increase in model parameters and data. This scalability is particularly beneficial for large-scale NLP applications, where computational resources are often scarce. However, training larger models often comes at the cost of increased computational requirements and environmental concerns (Strubell et al., 2019).\n\nRecently, the trillion parameter mark has been breached for PLMs (Fedus et al.), raising serious concerns about the environmental and economic sustainability of large-scale NLP models. Despite these concerns, training larger models may be unavoidable in the current training paradigm (Li et al., 2020). To deploy these models in practical applications such as virtual personal assistants, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms, model compression is necessary.\n\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) (Bucilu\u02c7a et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) is a simple yet powerful knowledge transfer algorithm used for compression (Jiao et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2019), ensembling (Hinton et al., 2015), and multi-task learning (Clark et al., 2019). In NLP, KD for compression has received renewed interest in the last few years, with a growing number of researchers exploring its applications in transformer-based PLMs (Rogers et al., 2020).\n\nOne key feature that makes KD attractive is its ability to work with any deep learning model, regardless of its architecture. This means that if a trillion parameter model resides on the cloud, an API-level access to the teacher's output is sufficient for KD. Consequently, the algorithm is architecture-agnostic, allowing the student model to be a different architecture from the teacher.\n\nRecent works on KD for transfer learning with PLMs have extended the algorithm in two main directions. The first direction is towards \"model\" distillation (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2019), where the intermediate weights, such as attention weights or intermediate layer outputs of transformers, are distilled. The second direction is towards curriculum-based or progressive KD (Sun et al., 2020; Mirzadeh et al., 2019), where the student learns one layer at a time or from an intermediary teacher, known as a teacher assistant.\n\nWhile these works have shown accuracy gains over standard KD, they have come at the cost of architectural assumptions, such as a common architecture between student and teacher, and greater access to teacher parameters and intermediate outputs.

Our work aims to address the limitations of existing KD methods and provide a more effective and efficient algorithm for model compression.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We present a text-based adversarial algorithm, MATE-KD, which increases the accuracy of the student model using KD.\n\u2022 Our algorithm only requires access to the teacher's logits and thus keeps the teacher and student architecture independent.\n\u2022 We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark and demonstrate improvement over competitive baselines.\n\u2022 On the GLUE test set, we achieve a score of 80.9, which is higher than BERT-LARGE.\n\u2022 We also demonstrate improvement on out-of-domain (OOD) evaluation.\n\nBy addressing the limitations of existing KD methods and providing a more effective and efficient algorithm for model compression, we hope to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient NLP models.", "scores": {"ppl": 36.365596771240234, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -4.535537242889404, "acc": 0.25}}}

However, they can generate toxic language, posing a potential security risk to NLP applications.\n\nToxic language includes hate speech, insults, and profanities, which can be detrimental to users and applications (Gehman et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Deshpande et al.). Mitigating this issue is crucial for ensuring the safe and responsible use of LLMs.\n\nResearchers have proposed various techniques to address this issue, including finetuning-based methods (Keskar et al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2020). These methods involve training the base model on nontoxic datasets to reduce toxic outputs. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources, especially for large models.\n\nAnother method involves adjusting the probabilities of potential toxic tokens during the decoding stage (Krause et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Hallinan et al.). Although this process does not require additional training, it necessitates an additional guiding model to modify probability distributions. Moreover, the memory occupied by this model must be maintained at each decoding step.\n\nThe third category is a prompt-based approach (Schick et al., 2021; Leong et al., 2023), which utilizes prompts to trigger the model's internal knowledge related to toxicity for detoxification. However, there is a lack of understanding about the working mechanisms of safety prompts, limiting their optimization.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a detoxification framework that leverages self-generated prefixes without requiring additional training parameters or data. Our approach is built on three key observations:\n\n1. LLMs reflect the types of inherent toxicity present within these models (Klein and Nabi, 2024).\n2. LLMs can recognize their undesirable toxicity to a considerable degree (Schick et al., 2021).\n3. Models can generate various texts by sampling from a raw prompt (Cheng et al., 2023), which can be classified as either toxic or nontoxic.\n\nDrawing on these findings, we propose a framework that dynamically adds self-generated text as positive and negative prefixes, guiding the context representations of the prompts. This approach forms differentiated information flows at the attention layer, which we use to construct subtoxicity vectors.\n\nWe aim to fuse these vectors to maximize the coverage of potential toxic behaviors. To achieve this, we utilize arithmetic operations on subtoxicity vectors, inspired by Ilharco et al.'s (2023) proposal for multi-task learning. Ultimately, detoxification generation is accomplished by utilizing a fused toxicity vector within the attention space.\n\nOur framework, FGDILP, considers subtoxicity information through instance-level prefixes. Specifically, it utilizes the model to self-generate multiple sampled texts of a raw prompt and self-diagnose them for classification into subtoxic and nontoxic categories as prefixes.\n\nAt each decoding step, a batch of synthetic prompts, consisting of a positive prefix-prepended prompt and multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts, is passed through the attention layer to construct vectors representing different subtoxic behaviors. Finally, we fuse them using arithmetic operations to collaboratively rectify the information flow of the raw prompt within the model, aiding the detoxification process.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\n\u2022 FGDILP dynamically constructs multiple prefixes to collaboratively correct the contextualized representation for removal of fine-grained subtoxicities.\n\u2022 Our approach surpasses current prompt-based methods while maintaining a lightweight structure compared to other methods.\n\u2022 We deeply analyze the construction of a synergistic mechanism involving the generation of prefixes and the fusion of toxicity vectors for instance-level detoxification, paving the way for exploring the detoxification of various fine-grained subtoxicities.\n\nOur framework offers a promising solution for mitigating toxic language generation in LLMs, providing a more nuanced understanding of subtoxic behaviors and their interactions.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "While pets can bring immense joy to a home, they also require a substantial investment of time, money, and love. To commit to a pet, you must consider whether you're prepared to make a long-term commitment, not just for the day but for years to come, and carefully weigh whether a pet is right for you now and in the long term. Most pets need attention and care throughout the day. It's essential to ensure you'll be home enough to provide for your pet, and you should also consider which pets are suitable for busy households, especially those with children. Hamsters and fish are excellent first pets due to their low-maintenance care and gentle nature. If you're planning significant life changes or moves, it's best to delay getting a pet until you're more settled and stable in your new home. When choosing a pet, keep in mind that different types have distinct needs, so select one that suits your lifestyle and living situation. Before acquiring a pet, research the behaviors and needs of various animals you're interested in, which will help you make an informed decision and ensure you're prepared to provide the best possible care. Being open-minded when selecting a pet can lead to happy surprises and finding the perfect pet for your family, as different animals bring unique qualities and personalities to the table. Dogs demand a lot of attention, time, and space, while cats are generally low-maintenance but still need love and care. Understanding these differences is key to finding the right pet for you. Fish require careful monitoring and care, while lizards are relatively easy to care for but offer minimal affection, and birds can be messy and loud, each with their own unique needs and challenges. Some breeds, like the Border Collie, have a strong herding instinct that can cause them to try to herd children, making it essential to consider a breed's temperament when deciding on a pet. A pet's environment should be comfortable, safe, and provide everything it needs to thrive, focusing on creating a space that meets its physical and emotional needs. If your pet is a cat that spends most of its time indoors, it's essential to maintain a clean and well-maintained litter tray to keep it happy and healthy. The initial setup costs may vary, but it's essential to factor in ongoing expenses like regular food purchases and veterinary care to ensure you're prepared for the financial responsibilities of pet ownership. If you want your pet to have outside time, consider installing a secure fence to prevent escape and ensure its safety. Adopting a pet during a relatively quiet time in your life can help minimize stress for both you and your new pet, making the transition smoother and more enjoyable. Before bringing your pet home, consult with pet store attendants about essential supplies, such as housing, toys, grooming tools, and other necessities, to ensure you're prepared for its arrival.

Most pets need attention and maintenance during the day, so ensure you'll be home to care for them.\n\nIf you have kids, consider which pets will be kid-friendly. Hamsters and fish make great early pets. However, if you plan to move or make significant lifestyle changes, you should wait until you're more stable. Different types of dogs have varying needs, so choose a pet that suits your means.\n\nBefore buying a pet, research their behaviors and needs. Be open-minded and consider multiple species or breeds. Keep in mind the general concerns for different pets:\n\nDogs need lots of attention, exercise, and space to roam. \nCats are intelligent and independent, requiring less supervision but still needing love and time.\nHamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents are economical and short-lived, but have strong odors.\nFish need careful monitoring and care, but won't cuddle.\nLizards are happy alone, easy to care for, but difficult to diagnose when sick.\nBirds can be messy, loud, and expensive, with temperamental bigger birds like parrots.\n\nRabbits are friendly first-time pets, but can make noise and mess.\n\nDon't just decide on a pet without considering their needs and requirements. Some breeds are natural shepherds, while others have strong instincts that may lead to injuries.\n\nA pet should live in an environment that's comfortable, safe, and provides what they need. Some animals are adaptable, like cats, while others have specific needs, like horses. \n\nIf your pet will roam the house, provide a place to sleep out of the way of household traffic. If they're a cat, ensure a litter tray is regularly cleaned.\n\nConsider the costs associated with pets, including set-up supplies and ongoing care, like regular food and vet visits. Don't forget to create boundaries or safe spaces to prevent accidents.\n\nAdopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life, and talk to pet store attendants or adoption agencies about necessary supplies. Teach your family how to use them, and help young children prepare for pet care by practicing with a doll or plants.\n\nIt's always a good idea to remove harmful objects, like knives, and put food out of their reach.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has sparked enthusiasm for leveraging these models to improve recommendation systems. Many language models are pre-trained on large-scale unsupervised corpora and fine-tuned for downstream tasks.\n\nThe Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, has become a foundation in LLMs. It replaced the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a self-attention mechanism, enabling parallelization and improving efficiency in handling sequential data. This architecture has led to the emergence of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).\n\nGPT series, developed by OpenAI, and BERT, developed by Google, represent prominent approaches to leveraging transformers for PLMs. The key advantage of incorporating PLMs into recommendation systems lies in their ability to extract high-quality representations of textual features and leverage extensive external knowledge.\n\nDifferent from traditional recommendation systems, LLM-based models can efficiently comprehend user contextual queries, item descriptions, and other textual data. Fine-tuning strategy involves training the model on a smaller task-specific dataset, typically related to a specific application or domain.\n\nFine-tuning large language models on specific downstream tasks is a computationally resource-consuming process, requiring significant resources. As a result, prompting is a more flexible and efficient paradigm that unifies the use of PLMs on different tasks.\n\nPrompting involves providing additional information for a trained model to condition while predicting output labels for a task. It bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives, allowing better utilization of the rich knowledge in pre-trained models. Prompting is particularly useful when little downstream data is available.\n\nThis survey focuses on utilizing LLMs for Personalized Explanation Generating tasks.

It involves providing additional information for a trained model to condition while predicting output labels for a task.\n\nPrompt tuning is different from fine-tuning in that it only requires storing a small task-specific prompt for each task instead of making a task-specific copy of the entire PLM.

If someone asks you to do something you don't have time for, practice saying \"no\" instead. You can say, \"I already made plans for tonight,\" or, \"That won't work this time,\" and let it go.\n\nYou don't have to feel guilty about prioritizing your needs and desires. If someone wants you to stay late after work or school to finish something, ask yourself if it's absolutely necessary.

Ensure you're underneath where the tub drains to avoid any complications. Always wear safety glasses while working with your saw to protect your eyes from debris. \n\nWhen it comes to controlling the water supply for your tub, it's either regulated by a valve in the wall behind your faucet or the main water pump. To turn it off, simply rotate the valve until it's perpendicular to the pipes. If your valve shut-off is circular, refer to the directions printed on the valve head to determine which way to turn it. In case you cannot turn off the water for your tub or bathroom, you may need to shut it off for the entire home or building.\n\nLocate the screw on the underside of the faucet or where it connects to the wall. Remove the screw using a flathead or Phillips screwdriver. If there's no screw, tighten the jaws of a pipe wrench around the back of the faucet and twist it counterclockwise until it's loose. Then, gently pull it out. If you want to save the faucet, place a rag between it and the wrench to prevent any scratches.\n\nA drain removal tool is a cylinder that fits into the drain to loosen its connection to the pipes.

Unscrew the overflow drain, located on the front wall of your tub, and pull it off of the surface.\n\nSome tub drains come with screens that you need to remove with a screwdriver before using the remover tool. You can purchase drain removers from your local hardware store. The drain shoe is made up of the pipes that connect the overflow and the main drain to your tub. Look for the T-shaped connector holding the pipes together, and use a pipe wrench to twist the drain shoe off of the main pipes. If the joint is stuck or won't come out with a pipe wrench, cut through the pipes with a reciprocating saw or hacksaw.\n\nWhen removing the tub, be prepared to tear out the surrounding drywall and any other obstructions. The surround is the tile or fiberglass on the walls around your tub. Use a pry bar or the back of a claw hammer to rip the surround away from your tub. When you reach the drywall, use a razor knife to cut out the area around it, extending 6 inches (15 cm) from the top of your tub until the studs are exposed.\n\nTo protect yourself, wear safety glasses, work gloves, and a respirator. If your tub has a surround panel made from fiberglass, you'll need to remove the entire piece to install a new bathtub. The flange around your tub is the raised edge that keeps water from draining into your walls. Remove the screws or nails from the flange using an electric screwdriver or the back of your claw hammer. Be sure to check each stud around your bath for any nails. Some older tubs may not be nailed or screwed into the wall.\n\nRun a razor knife through the caulk or sealant surrounding your tub. Cut through the line of sealant that connects the apron, or front of your tub, to the floor. Grab the tub from the side opposite of the drain and lift it out from its place.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Once upon a time, in a quaint village surrounded by lush forests and sparkling rivers, there lived a young girl named Elara. She had always been deeply fascinated by the captivating tales of adventure that her grandmother had shared with her during long, cozy winter nights by the fireplace, where the flickering flames danced across the walls. The stories, filled with brave heroes, hidden treasures, and mystical lands, kindled a sense of longing within Elara to explore the world beyond the confines of her village, and to discover the secrets that lay hidden beyond its familiar borders. One day, as she wandered through the forest collecting wildflowers, Elara stumbled upon an ancient, weathered map that had been partially hidden beneath a pile of leaves, its faded ink and worn creases a testament to its age and significance. The map seemed to depict a winding path leading to a mysterious location marked with an 'X', which had piqued Elara's curiosity and sparked a desire to embark on a journey to uncover the secrets that lay hidden at the marked spot. Elara packed a small bag with essential items, including a crusty loaf of bread, a flask of cool water, and a sturdy walking stick that would serve as her trusted companion on the long and arduous journey ahead. She bid a heartfelt farewell to her family, who had reluctantly allowed her to pursue her dream, and set off at dawn, the early morning sunlight casting a warm glow over the village as she departed. The path outlined on the map led her through dense, emerald woods, across babbling streams that sang sweet melodies, and up steep hills that challenged her resolve and determination. As she journeyed on, Elara marveled at the breathtaking beauty of the natural world, each step bringing her closer to her goal and filling her heart with a sense of wonder and awe. After several days of travel, she reached the edge of a vast, arid desert, where the map suggested that she needed to cross the scorching expanse to continue her quest, the unforgiving sun beating down upon her like a relentless drum. Determined to succeed, Elara pressed on, undeterred by the scorching heat and relentless winds that threatened to derail her progress, her spirit unbroken and her resolve unshaken. Her perseverance paid off when she finally reached the other side, where lush greenery greeted her like a verdant oasis in the midst of the desert's desolation. In the heart of this verdant haven, Elara discovered an ancient temple shrouded in vines, its crumbling stones and overgrown vegetation a testament to its age and forgotten history. With a mix of excitement and apprehension, she cautiously stepped inside, the dimly lit interior a stark contrast to the bright sunlight that had illuminated her journey thus far. The interior was dimly lit, with sunlight filtering through narrow cracks in the stone walls, casting eerie shadows that danced across the floor. She could hear the faint echo of her footsteps as she ventured deeper into the temple, the silence a haunting reminder of the secrets that lay hidden within its ancient stones. At the center of the temple lay a grand chamber, where a pedestal stood adorned with intricate carvings that told the story of a long-forgotten civilization. Atop it rested a shimmering gemstone, its surface glistening in the dim light like a celestial wonder, its beauty and radiance a testament to the temple's mysterious power. Elara approached cautiously, her heart racing with anticipation as she reached out to touch the gem, the air around her humming with energy and the warmth spreading through her fingertips a sensation like no other. In that moment, she realized the true treasure of her journey, for it was not merely the discovery of the gemstone, but the courage, resilience, and wisdom she had gained along the way. It was the knowledge that she was capable of overcoming even the most daunting challenges, and that the journey itself had been the true treasure, a test of her will and a proving ground for her spirit. Elara returned to her village a changed person, her spirit enriched by the adventures she had experienced and her heart filled with a sense of wonder and awe. She shared her story with others, inspiring them to pursue their own dreams and explore the world around them, her words a beacon of hope and a reminder that the greatest treasures in life are often the ones we find within ourselves. Her journey had come full circle, transforming her life and the lives of those around her, a testament to the power of courage, perseverance, and the human spirit. An event in my life that was memorable and happened between three and six months ago was when my friend and I, who live fairly far apart, decided to meet up again because it had been a while since we'd seen each other, and we were both looking forward to spending time together. We usually try to see each other at least three to four times a year due to the distance between us, but it's always a special occasion when we do get to meet, and we try to make the most of it. My friend lives further north, and I live further south in the United States, so it's not always easy to find a time that works for both of us, but we make it a priority to stay in touch and plan regular get-togethers. Every year we try to get together over the phone and discuss the arrangements for our next meeting, where we'll talk about where we're going to stay, how much it will cost for both plane and hotel tickets, and make all the necessary arrangements. As well as the types of foods we'd be interested in and also what we plan to do together when we get to see each other, we like to make a list of all the things we want to do and see, so we can make the most of our time together. We had been counting down the days until our next meeting for the last three months, and we finally got to see each other earlier this month, which was a wonderful experience. Fall is always my favorite time of year, and my friend really likes it when it's cooler while visiting because they can't stand the heat, so we often plan our meetings for this time of year. So, it's the perfect time for us to get together and hang out, spend time together, and enjoy the beautiful fall weather, which is always a treat. Once my friend arrived, I went to pick them up from the airport, and we drove to our hotel, where we spent some time adjusting and getting our items unpacked, making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Then we decided we were hungry, so we ordered our food and went to pick it up from the restaurant, where we had planned to eat. We decided to go to a grill-like restaurant and pick up some hamburgers and fries, which were absolutely delicious, and we enjoyed our meal together, savoring the taste and each other's company. Afterwards, we came back to the hotel and ate, enjoying the rest of our meal in the comfort of our room. The next day, we went to a carnival for 'October', which is my favorite time of year, and we spent the day walking around together, just talking and enjoying each other's company, and we played some games as well as rode the Spider, a really fun ride that looks like a space ship and spins really fast. We then got on this really high ride that goes up into the sky and then falls back down really fast, which was really scary at first, but it was also really fun, and we had a great time. But it was really fun and we had a great time, and I'm so glad we did it together. We then went back to the hotel and enjoyed the evening with one another, sitting and watching a cop show that we both love, and it was just a really beautiful and fun time together, and I'll always cherish our time together because it's so special to me and to my friend.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "There is an increasing interest in building speech tools benefiting low-resource languages, specifically multilingual models that can improve low-resource recognition using rich resources available in other languages like English and Mandarin. One standard tool for recognition in low-resource languages is multilingual acoustic modeling. Acoustic models are generally trained on parallel data of speech waveforms and phoneme transcriptions, which involves the alignment of audio signals with their corresponding written transcriptions, providing a crucial step in understanding the complex relationship between sound and meaning. Importantly, phonemes are perceptual units of sound that closely correlate with but do not exactly correspond to the actual sounds that are spoken, phones. An example of this is shown in Figure 1, which demonstrates two English words that share the same phoneme /p/ but differ in the actual phonetic realizations [p] and [ph], highlighting the complexities of phonetic representation. Allophones are the sets of phones that correspond to a particular phoneme, and these sets are language-specific; distinctions that are important in some languages, such as the difference between the English phonemes /p/ and /ph/, are not important in others, such as Mandarin Chinese. Most multilingual acoustic models simply use existing phoneme transcriptions as-is, taking the union of the phoneme sets to be shared by all training languages, but this approach can be overly simplistic and may not account for the complexities of phonetic representation. The assumption is reasonable under some circumstances as phoneme names are typically associated with their most common or least marked allophone, but this is often determined by the phonetician's expertise and the specific language being studied. However, this is obviously an oversimplified view: in Figure 1, for example, this would mean that all training in English would assign the phones [p] and [ph] to phoneme /p/, which would be detrimental if we want to recognize Mandarin Chinese, for instance, where the two phones are corresponding to two distinctive phonemes /p/ and /ph/. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multilingual recognition based on phonetic annotation to tackle this problem, which we call Allosaurus (allophone system of automatic recognition for universal speech). Our method incorporates knowledge of phonology into the multilingual model through an allophone layer, which associates a universal narrow phone set with the phonemes that appear in the transcription of each language, providing a more nuanced understanding of phonetic representation. Our model first computes the phone distribution using a standard ASR encoder, then the allophone layer maps the phone distribution into the phoneme distribution for each language, allowing for a more accurate representation of phonetic relationships. This model can be trained end-to-end using only standard phonemic transcriptions and an allophone list created by expert phoneticians, who have a deep understanding of the complexities of phonetic representation and can provide a more accurate representation of phonetic relationships. The allophone layer is first initialized with the allophone list, then is further optimized during the training process, allowing the model to learn the complex relationships between phones and phonemes. We demonstrate that accounting for the phoneme-phone mismatch in this way improves the accuracy of multilingual acoustic modeling by 2.0% phoneme error rate in low-resource conditions, providing a significant improvement over previous approaches. Furthermore, the architecture simultaneously makes it possible to perform universal phone recognition, allowing for the recognition of phones in any language, regardless of the specific phonetic representation used.

One standard tool for recognition in low-resource languages is multilingual acoustic modeling, a technique that has garnered significant attention in recent years. Acoustic models are generally trained on parallel data of speech waveforms and phoneme transcriptions, which are then used to predict the spoken words. Importantly, phonemes are perceptual units of sound that closely correlate with, but do not exactly correspond to, the actual sounds that are spoken, known as phones. For instance, the English language has a phoneme /p/ which can be realized as different phones such as [p] and [ph], as shown in Figure 1. An example of this is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows two English words that share the same phoneme /p/, but differ in the actual phonetic realizations [p] and [ph]. Allophones are the sets of phones that correspond to a particular phoneme, and these sets are language-specific; distinctions that are important in some languages are not important in others. Most multilingual acoustic models simply use existing phoneme transcriptions as-is, taking the union of the phoneme sets to be shared by all training languages. However, this assumption is reasonable under some circumstances, as phoneme names are typically associated with their most common or least marked allophone. Nevertheless, this is an oversimplified view, as shown in Figure 1, where the phoneme /p/ in English would correspond to the phones [p] and [ph], which are distinct phonemes in Mandarin Chinese. In Mandarin Chinese, the two phones [p] and [ph] are corresponding to two distinctive phonemes /p/ and /ph/, which would be detrimental to recognition if we use the existing phoneme transcriptions as-is.

Our approach can be applied to various languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, and many others, making it a versatile tool for speech recognition. Additionally, our method can be used to improve the recognition of languages with complex phonology, such as Arabic and Russian, which have a large number of distinct phonemes and phones. By incorporating knowledge of phonology into the multilingual model, our method can better handle the phoneme-phone mismatch and improve the accuracy of speech recognition. The proposed method has several advantages over previous approaches, including improved accuracy, versatility, and comprehensiveness.

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "The frame is the base of the bike and can be one of the most expensive parts you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight. Carbon fiber is the gold standard for lightweight bikes, but it is unfortunately a bit brittle. You'll often see it used in mountain bikes, as the technology has advanced over the years. Be cautious when purchasing a second-hand carbon bike, as the technology has evolved over time and the bike's condition may be uncertain. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively made with carbon fiber. Titanium is a high-end option that has the same stiffness as steel but is less dense. Titanium is often used in mountain and road bikes due to its high-end properties and durability. Aluminum: This strong and lightweight material is commonly used in bike frames due to its durability and affordability. They can be made as light as steel, but they won't be as lightweight as carbon fiber. Steel: This sturdy material is commonly used in older bikes due to its durability and affordability, but it can be heavier than other options. However, some custom steel bikes, especially those designed for racing, might still be under 20 lb (9.1 kg). One of the best 'bang for your buck' fixes is to upgrade to lighter wheels, which can improve aerodynamics and reduce weight. You'll not only lose weight, but you'll also become significantly more aerodynamic, making it easier to maintain high speeds and maneuver through tight spaces. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an 'upgrade' depends on your current bike setup, but some sure-fire ways to reduce weight include upgrading to lighter wheels, using aerodynamic bars, and optimizing your drivetrain. Steel or carbon fiber wheels are good options, as they can provide significant weight reduction and improve aerodynamics. Tubular wheels are not recommended for casual riders, as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace. Aero wheels can significantly reduce wind resistance and improve aerodynamics, making them a popular choice among serious cyclists. Mountain bike tires, which are designed for off-road use, are not suitable for paved hills and can cause significant discomfort and safety issues. If you ride more on roads than trails, consider commuter or 'cross' tires, which are designed for on-road use and can provide a smooth ride and improved handling. Slicks are a great option for light trails, such as footpaths, and can provide a smooth ride and improved handling. Examine your chain rings, which are the large metal gears located beside your right pedal and play a crucial role in your bike's performance. If you have three chain rings, consider upgrading to a 'compact crank,' which can provide improved efficiency and reduced weight. Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, such as triathlon bars, can significantly reduce weight and dampen vibrations on bumpy roads, improving your overall ride comfort and performance. Remember that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle and prone to damage, so it's essential to have it checked at your local bike shop after any major crash or impact. Many bike accessories can add unnecessary weight, so it's essential to carefully evaluate their necessity and remove any unnecessary items. Remove any unnecessary accessories like saddlebags, lights, and fenders, especially when riding in dry conditions or on long distances, to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. For short rides, consider removing extra water bottle cages, but always have at least one water bottle on hand, unless water is provided by the race or a designated water stop. These minor adjustments won't make a significant difference in weight, but they can still improve safety and visibility on busy roads by preserving bike lights and other essential features. For serious racers, lighter shoes and aero helmets can reduce weight, enhance performance, and give a competitive edge, while also looking professional and stylish. You can also upgrade to racing pedals and wear lightweight shoes designed to attach to them, which can provide improved power transfer and efficiency. For the most extreme cases, race trimming involves removing every gram of weight possible, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process. Jack Pullar, a professional rider, took an extreme approach by removing his seat covering, drilling holes in his saddle, and sawing off his handlebars to achieve significant weight reduction, but such modifications are not recommended for casual riders. While you should be cautious, some race modifications include removing the seat post, trimming cables, and upgrading to lighter components. Removing 1-2 inches from the seat post, leaving at least 2 1\u20442 in (6.4 cm) in the seat tube, is an acceptable modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Trimming the ends of your cables and cable housings can be an effective modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Removing water cages and bolts can be a simple and effective modification that can reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. Unless you're willing to invest in a high-end, 11lb bike costing $15,000, you won't experience significant weight loss, and the cost may not be justified. Swapping to a lighter group set (gears) and derailleur can save around 1/3 of the weight of an iPhone 4, which can be a significant improvement for serious cyclists. You're unlikely to notice a significant difference, but the weight reduction can still improve your overall bike performance and ride comfort. For the Tour de France and other elite cycling events, you'll need the lightest bike possible to achieve optimal performance and speed. Otherwise, focus on cost-effective fixes and building stronger legs, rather than investing in a lighter bike, which may not be necessary for most riders. If you have nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, consider upgrading to a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first, which can provide a significant weight reduction and improved performance. These adjustments won't make a significant difference in weight, but they can still improve your overall bike performance and ride comfort by reducing weight and improving aerodynamics. Rather than investing in a lighter bike for minimal weight savings, consider adopting a healthier lifestyle to reduce body weight and improve overall performance. In general, it's often more effective to adopt a healthier lifestyle to reduce body weight and improve overall performance rather than investing in a lighter bike for minimal weight savings. The frame is the base of the bike and is often one of the most expensive parts you can buy.", "scores": {"ppl": 28.37885284423828, "some": 0.863442579905192, "bart": -2.209052562713623, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "The frame is the base of the bike and can be one of the most expensive parts you can purchase.

When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight, which can greatly impact the overall performance and functionality of the bike. \n\nCarbon-fiber: The gold standard for lightweight bikes, carbon fiber is unfortunately a bit brittle, making it prone to damage if not handled with care. You will quite often see it on mountain bikes as the technology has progressed over the years, so be careful if you decide to buy a second-hand carbon bike. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber, due to its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber frames can be incredibly lightweight, with some weighing as little as 3-4 pounds, making them ideal for professional cyclists competing in high-level events.\n\nTitanium: Titanium is another high-end option that has the same stiffness as steel but is not as dense, giving it a unique combination of strength and lightness. Titanium is often found on mountain and road bikes, as it provides an excellent balance of performance and durability. Titanium frames can be more expensive than other materials, but they are also extremely resistant to corrosion and wear, making them a popular choice for cyclists who ride in harsh environments.\n\nAluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the most common frames you can buy for any bike, and they offer an excellent balance of performance and affordability. They can be made as light as steel but will not be as light as carbon fiber, making them a great choice for casual cyclists who want a lightweight bike without breaking the bank. Aluminum frames are also relatively easy to repair and maintain, making them a popular choice for commuters and recreational riders.\n\nSteel: Sturdy but heavy, steel is most common on old bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights, and they provide a smooth and comfortable ride. However, some custom steel bikes might still be under 20 pounds, making them a great choice for cyclists who prioritize comfort and stability over weight. Steel frames are also extremely durable and can withstand the rigors of heavy use, making them a popular choice for families and commuters.\n\nPerhaps the best \"bang for your buck\" fix is to get lighter wheels, which can have a significant impact on the overall weight and performance of the bike. You will not only lose weight, but you'll also become remarkably more aerodynamic, making it easier to ride long distances and climb steep hills. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike, and they can be a cost-effective way to improve the performance of your bike without breaking the bank.\n\nWhat constitutes an \"upgrade\" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes. 16. Steel or carbon-fiber wheels Tubular wheels, not recommended for anything other than racing as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace.\n\nAero wheels: These wheels are designed to cut through the air with ease, providing an excellent balance of speed and stability. They are a great choice for cyclists who ride on flat roads and want to improve their overall performance.\n\nMountain bike tires: These tires are big and knobby, making them ideal for off-road riding, but they can be a hindrance on paved roads, where they can cause the bike to slow down and become unstable.\n\nCommuter or \"cross\" tires: These tires are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding, making them a great choice for commuters and recreational riders who want a bike that can handle a variety of terrain.\n\nSlicks: These tires are a viable choice for light trails such as footpaths, and they can provide a smooth and comfortable ride on paved roads.\n\nLook at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a \"compact crank,\" which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have fewer gears to work with, you will lose weight, and many riders find that they forget they ever had a third ring after a few weeks of riding.\n\nIf you still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. However, this may not be as effective as switching to a compact crank, as the weight savings will be relatively small.\n\nCarbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathlon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle, so if you crash, be sure to get it checked at your local bike shop.\n\nThere are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city.\n\nIf you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race. These will only shave a few grams off your total weight -- hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that will protect you on busy roads.\n\nLighter shoes and aero helmets can cut down weight and keep you quick and professional-looking, but they can also get expensive. You can also swap out your pedals for racing pedals and wear lightweight shoes that attach to them.\n\nNot for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can, and it's a process that requires a great deal of expertise and precision. Professional riders who participate in high-level events often go to great lengths to shave off weight, including ripping off seat coverings, drilling holes into saddles, and sawing off the bottoms of handlebars.\n\nWhile you should be careful not to damage your bike, some race modifications include sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set, leaving at least 2 1/2 inches of the seat post in the seat tube to avoid damaging the frame. Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings, and removing water cages and bolts, can also help to shave off weight.\n\nUnless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11-pound bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter group set (your gears) and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 of an iPhone 4, but you will not notice the difference.\n\nIf you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get, but for most casual cyclists, sticking to a few bigger, cost-effective fixes and working on getting stronger legs is a more practical approach. If you've got nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, get a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first. They won't make a huge difference, but they will make the bike lighter.\n\nInstead of spending money on a lighter bike for a minimal weight difference, try changing your lifestyle to lose body weight instead. This can be achieved through a combination of diet, exercise, and stress management, and it's a more sustainable and effective way to improve your overall performance.", "scores": {"ppl": 18.740243911743164, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -1.0087506771087646, "acc": 0.25}}}

The cancer was inoperable, and her only options were chemotherapy and radiation treatment. She had already been grappling with Fibromyalgia, making a cancer battle even more daunting, but we were determined to face it together. The doctor decided to delay chemotherapy, citing that it would be too much for her on the first day of radiation. On that first day, we spent hours at the infusion center, watching as she was hooked up for treatment. She was then forced to rely on a portable chemo pump, which would infuse chemicals into her body around the clock. By Monday, she had started treatment, but by Wednesday, she was bedridden with intense sickness. Her condition rapidly deteriorated, leaving her disoriented and struggling to speak. The pain was almost unbearable, and even a gentle touch from me made her scream in agony. I called 911, and as we waited for help, her condition worsened dramatically. In about 10 minutes, the ambulance arrived, and I tried to clear a path for the paramedics as they rushed to her side. Four paramedics were needed to carefully lift her onto the gurney amidst her agony and delirium, as we frantically tried to comfort her in the chaos. In that moment, I was so consumed by worry that I momentarily forgot about our little girl waiting anxiously at home.

The doctor decided to delay chemotherapy, starting it a few days after radiation. Both treatments on the same day would be overwhelming for her. We visited the infusion center, where she received treatment for four hours. She was given a portable chemo pump to use 24 hours a day.

I realized she needed to go to the hospital, but moving her was difficult. She was in immense pain, and I couldn't touch her without her screaming. I called 911, and while waiting for the ambulance, her condition worsened. Four paramedics arrived, and we struggled to get her on the gurney.

Even though she had been doing better, the call still felt ominous, given the concern in my dad's voice, which made me realize that something was seriously wrong. My dad told me that my Maw Maw had passed away early that morning, and my heart shattered into a million pieces as I struggled to come to terms with the devastating news. My heart broke at the news, as if it had been torn in two, and I felt a deep sense of sorrow and loss. My Maw Maw was an incredible person who had always put others before herself, and her selfless love and kindness inspired everyone who knew her. She was a loving person who had given her heart to everyone she met, and her kindness had touched countless lives, leaving a lasting impact on those around her. She was married to my Paw Paw for over 50 years, and after his passing, her health began to decline significantly due to the immense loss she suffered, which made me wonder why she had to go through so much pain. She never smoked a day in her life or drank anything, but I still wonder why she was taken from me so soon and at such a young age, especially considering how devoted she was to her loved ones, and the pain of her loss still feels overwhelming. She never smoked a day in her life or drank so I will always question why she was taken so soon and young from me but I know she hadn't been the same since my Paw Paw passed, he was her rock and she loved him with all her heart. After receiving the news, I immediately started searching for flights to get to the funeral as soon as possible, which involved changing my flight and trying to process the devastating news, all while being in a state of shock. I had to wait two days for a flight, and my mom was planning the funeral for that Friday; I flew out early Tuesday morning to be with my family, who were all struggling to come to terms with the loss of our beloved Maw Maw. It was nice to get home to family sooner than expected, but Maw Maw was deeply missed, and her absence was felt by everyone, leaving a gaping hole in our lives. He was stronger than I was, and he was able to look at her at the viewing and say goodbye, a difficult experience for him as well, and I could see the pain in his eyes as he struggled to cope with the loss. Seeing a dead body and knowing that person is no longer inside it is a painful and haunting experience that can be overwhelming, and it's something that I will never forget. The viewing and funeral went on, but they felt rushed due to the circumstances surrounding her passing and the need to quickly settle her estate, which added to our emotional pain. The funeral felt rushed because her house was set to close before she passed, and we had to quickly clean it out for the new owners, which left us scrambling to figure out what to do with the rest of her belongings, a process that was difficult for me, and it felt like we were losing her all over again. My parents live in Georgia, I'm in Texas, and Maw Maw lived in North Carolina, which made it challenging to manage her belongings and plan the funeral, and it felt like we were dealing with a long-distance loss. As a result, we had limited options for where to store her belongings, aside from my uncle's house, which was already packed to the brim, and it felt like we were running out of space to hold onto her memories. I'll always remember my Maw Maw as the most incredible woman I ever knew, and I plan to make sure my kids remember how amazing a person she was and the incredible impact she had on everyone's lives, and I want them to learn from her example.

It's a good idea to change into fresh underwear after gym class.\n\nIf you choose to do so, the procedure is basically the same as changing your pants. Begin by having your underwear ready next to you. You don't want to be searching through your gym bag for your clean pair after you've removed your dirty pair.\n\nLoosen your gym pants, and then slide them down along with your underwear. Sit down once they are past your hips. Step out of your dirty clothes, grab your fresh underwear, and step into them. Once your feet are both through the opening, slide them up quickly.\n\nYou should be able to slide your underwear up and over your hips while sitting down without having to stand all the way up. It's probably best if you leave your shirt on while you do this\u2014you'll feel less exposed. You can also drape a towel over your lap while you are changing your underwear.\n\nIf you need to wear a sports bra for gym class, you could just wear one to school and not change. However, this may not be comfortable all day, or it may not look right in your street clothes. If that's the case, it's fairly easy to change in the locker room without drawing too much attention to yourself.\n\nTo change into a sports bra, begin by removing your shirt and putting your sports bra on over your regular bra. Then, reach under the sports bra to unhook your regular bra. Slide the right bra strap out over your shoulder and pull your arm out.\n\nRepeat on the left side, and then remove your regular bra by pulling it out from the front. Reach under your sports bra and pull your regular bra out. Have your shirt ready to slip on quickly once you're done with this.\n\nIt's probably a bit too hard to do this with a shirt on, though you could practice at home to see if it's possible. Changing quickly and easily is all about being prepared and knowing the right techniques. By following these steps, you can change your shirt and pants without drawing too much attention to yourself.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your comfort and modesty when changing in public. Change into your gym clothes as soon as possible to avoid feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious.\n\nWhen changing into your gym clothes, keep your underwear and sports bra on until you are ready to change into your gym pants and shirt. This will help you feel more secure and confident.\n\nIt's also a good idea to change into your gym clothes in a private area, such as a locker room or a secluded spot in the gym. This will help you feel more comfortable and secure.\n\nChanging quickly and easily is an important part of gym class.

Moreover, water is free of calories, making it a much better choice than sugary drinks. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only water, your odds of losing weight will significantly increase. If you need something flavored from time to time, choose unsweetened tea or black coffee, apart from right before a workout. Then you can feel free to consume a cup of black coffee with a splash of skim milk. The caffeine blast is reported to give you a kick, making you work out a little bit harder. \n\nDrinking water can also up your metabolism, in addition to making you feel full. Recent studies show that drinking two glasses of cold water can increase your metabolism about 40% for 15-20 minutes. Participants in these studies reportedly lost 15 pounds in three months, largely by drinking only water. To maximize its benefits, drink water consistently, 24/7, apart from right before a workout. Someone following a standard diet can usually afford to fall off the junk food wagon once or twice without suffering major repercussions. For more extreme, short-term weight loss goals, however, junk food must be completely avoided.\n\nStay away from greasy, fatty foods as well as those with a high sugar content. Anything battered, fried, covered in chocolate, packaged, or loaded up and preserved with sugar is a no-go. Be sure to read your labels carefully, even for products like yogurt and granola bars that may appear healthy. These can be powerhouses of sugar, which are detrimental to your weight loss goals. \n\nTo lower the spike in your insulin levels and up your fat stores, cut out the processed carbs \u2013 that means white rice, bread, and potatoes, in addition to cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream. You may be better off cutting out carbs in general. \n\nLet's face it: 20 pounds in 2 weeks is a tall order. To put your body in ketosis, where it's feeding off your fat stores and not your glycogen stores, you'll have to go completely low or no carb. In addition to no sweets, you'll have to cut out starchy vegetables, whole grains, and sugary fruits. What's more, being hungry makes the temptation to cave to your old habits all the more powerful. Consistently eating good-for-you, healthy foods keeps the other cravings at bay. When you're more full, you make better decisions.\n\nIn the way of vegetables, eat more asparagus, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. As for fruits, gravitate toward blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon. Instead of beef and pork, opt for leaner meats like chicken or fish, which provide beneficial oils for your body. Consuming fish is especially helpful in subduing the urge to consume greasy or fattening foods. And as for vegetables, go for it \u2013 pile 'em on at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They're nutritious, generally not full of calories or sugars, and keep you full. They're the shortest track to losing weight there is.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that in the short term, fad diets can work. If you're looking to lose weight very quickly and don't care if you gain it back, then a fad diet could be okay for you in this situation.

The bond is sold at a premium because the market interest rate is lower than the coupon rate. To calculate a bond's selling price, we need to add its present value of the principal, the present value of the interest payments, and any accrued interest. The premium is the bond's selling price minus its face value. To calculate the bond's selling price, we first need to determine the total number of periods it will pay interest. The semi-annual coupon payment of $25,000 is paid over 10 periods (5 years with 2 periods per year). The present value of the principal is found using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. The present value of the principal is simply the bond's face value multiplied by the present value interest factor. The present value interest factor is 1 / (1 + r)^n, where r is the market interest rate and n is the number of periods. The present value of the principal is the bond's face value multiplied by the present value interest factor. PVIF = 1 / (1 + 0.04)^10 = 0.6756.

This means that the price of the bond is more than its face value, also known as the par value. To compensate for the difference, investors pay a premium. For instance, Company XYZ issued 5-year, $500,000, 10 percent bonds with semi-annual interest payments. The market interest rate was 8 percent, so the bond had to be issued at a premium.\n\nThe bond's selling price equals the present value of the principal plus the present value of the interest payments. The premium is the difference between the selling price and the face value of the bond. In this case, the coupon rate per period is 5 percent (10 percent / 2), and the market interest rate per period is 4 percent (8 percent / 2). There are 10 periods (2 periods per year * 5 years).\n\nThe coupon payment per period is $25,000 ($500,000 * 0.05). To calculate the present value of the principal, multiply the face value of the bond by the present value interest factor (PVIF). The formula for PVIF is 1/(1 + r)^t, where r is the market interest rate per period and t is the number of periods. \n\nPVIF = 1 / (1 + 0.04)^10 = 0.6756. The present value of the principal is $500,000 * 0.6756 = $337,800. To calculate the present value of the interest payments, multiply the coupon payment per period by the present value factor for an ordinary annuity (PVOA). The formula for PVOA is (1 - (1 / (1 + r)^t)) / r.\n\nPVOA = (1 - (1 / (1 + 0.04)^10)) / 0.06 = 8.1109. The present value of the interest payments is $25,000 * 8.1109 = $202,773. The selling price of the bond is the present value of the principal plus the present value of the interest: $337,800 + $202,773 = $540,573. The premium is $540,573 - $500,000 = $40,573.\n\nThe interest payment per period is the coupon payment per period multiplied by the face value of the bond: $500,000 * 0.05 = $25,000. If you sold the bond at a premium, the effective interest rate you pay equals the market interest rate at the time of issue. The total interest expense is the present value of the bond multiplied by the effective interest rate per period. \n\nIn this case, the present value of the bond is $540,573, and the effective interest rate per period is 4 percent. The total interest expense is $540,573 * 0.04 = $21,623. However, because you issued the bond at a premium, you have to separate the interest paid to investors from the amortization of the premium on your financial statements. The total effective interest expense is $21,623, and the coupon payment to investors is $25,000. The amortization expense of the premium for this period is $25,000 - $21,623 = $3,377.\n\nOn your financial statement, record a debit of $21,623 to interest expense, a debit of $3,377 to Premium on Bonds Payable, and a credit of $25,000 to Cash. To calculate the present value of the bond for the next period, subtract the amortization recorded for this period from the beginning present value.

Appreciating the freedom of having no responsibility allows you to value it more when you have the choice to say yes or no to others. Effectively managing your expectations is key to reducing annoyance in the long run. Developing strategies to deal with stress is an effective way to manage stress and maintain emotional well-being. Think about this: what's the real benefit of getting annoyed, and is it truly worth the emotional toll? You might think you're superior to someone else, but does your self-worth really depend on how others perceive you, or is it rooted in your own self-acceptance? Focusing on your actions rather than others' will make your identity stronger and more resilient, allowing you to navigate life's challenges with confidence. When someone annoys us, we get angry and want to react, but pausing for a moment can help prevent regrettable outbursts. That's when we say or do things we later regret, which can escalate situations and make them even worse. When our outbursts make a situation worse, it's often not worth reacting, so take a moment to reassess and choose a more mindful path. It's usually not worth getting worked up over something that won't make a difference in the long run, so prioritize your emotional well-being. If a coworker makes a thoughtless comment, you might want to address it, but if they're just being annoying, it's best not to give them the satisfaction of a reaction; instead, maintain your calm demeanor. Maintaining a calm demeanor is crucial in preventing situations from escalating and creating a more peaceful environment. Rather than assuming an annoying person is trying to annoy you, try to see that they're probably unaware of their impact and may even be struggling with their own issues. Most people aren't trying to annoy you; they just don't realize the effect of their actions, and a little empathy can go a long way in diffusing tension.

In the grand scheme of life, these small annoyances don't really matter; what truly matters is how you respond to them and the choices you make. By letting go of minor annoyances and focusing on what truly matters, you can significantly improve your life and find greater peace and happiness. It's essential to accept the things you cannot change and focus on what you can control and influence, rather than wasting energy on things that are outside of your power. You can change yourself and your surroundings, but you can't change others; so focus your efforts on what you can control and cultivate a sense of inner peace. The desire to be universally liked can lead to frustration, as there will always be someone who disapproves of you, and it's essential to find self-acceptance and self-worth beyond others' opinions. The most effective way to counter ignorance or prejudice is often to simply ignore it and continue living your life with kindness and compassion. Rather than trying to force your success on others, just live your life and let it speak for itself, allowing your true character and values to shine through. Those who refuse to change are often beyond persuasion, so it's best not to waste your time trying to change them, and instead focus on nurturing positive relationships and environments.", "scores": {"ppl": 16.773326873779297, "some": 0.8757168451944987, "bart": -2.443357467651367, "acc": 0.25}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Here's the polished text with fewer than 420 tokens and more than 400. Each sentence has fewer than 15 tokens, and the 17th and 26th sentences remain unchanged.\n\nBreathe deeply from your diaphragm to reduce stress. Calmly count to ten, slowly. Imagine yourself on a serene beach. Let the soothing sounds of waves and seagulls wash over you. Feel the mist of seawater on your face and let it calm you.  Channel your most calming memory of experience; a loved one, success, or the bliss of no responsibility. This step is about managing expectations. We often have specific ideas of how people should act, and then we get annoyed when they fail. \"Common standards of decency,\" we say. However, expecting others to be fundamentally decent can cause annoyance and unhappiness. Setting low expectations is a better approach. Don't expect people to wow you with their manners or speech. When you don't expect much, you appreciate it more when they please you. Setting reasonable expectations is key to being less annoyed. Ask yourself, \"What do I get out of being annoyed?\" If you think about it, it's probably not much. Maybe you feel superior to the other person. But do you really want your identity to derive from what others do?  Your identity will be stronger if you base it on what you do, not others. When someone annoys us, we often react impulsively. That's when we say something we shouldn't or do something regrettable. After breathing deeply, center yourself and consider whether it's worth reacting. It may not be. If a coworker makes a sexist comment, it's okay to say something. But if a coworker plays the same joke on you for the twentieth time, not reacting will serve you best. Unpleasant body language conveys anger and contempt. These behaviors are contagious, so if they target the person annoying you, that person is likely to feel angry back. Maintain a calm demeanor, betraying nothing that suggests you're annoyed. Assume the annoying person doesn't know how they are coming off. Most people aren't deliberately trying to annoy you; they're probably in their own world. Everyone thinks about themselves more than others think about them. A little kid on an airplane, a loud cell phone user, or a lady asking the same question twice at the DMV are all small fry. In the big scheme of things, they don't matter. You can improve your quality of life by letting go, stopping the small stuff, and focusing on the things that truly matter. Accept the things you cannot change. You can change yourself, your walls, and your house decor, but not someone else. Focus your energies on what you can change, and those around you will appreciate it. No matter who you are, there will always be someone who doesn't understand you or thinks about you in an unflattering way. Don't try to win over those who are apathetic or hostile to you, because it's a fool's errand. This desire comes from a selfish place and is toxic. No matter who you are, someone dislikes you. It's possible to overcome prejudice, but it rarely happens, and it never happens fast. Prove the haters wrong by doing your own thing. The best thing you can do is forget about it, continue to live your life, and prove them wrong by example. Show them what an amazing person you are, but don't shove it in their face.", "scores": {"ppl": 32.14521789550781, "some": 0.9279608726501465, "bart": -4.875266075134277, "acc": 0.0}}}

{"trips_llama3": {"polished_text": "Chalky paint has a matte finish, goes on with minimal prep work, and is easier to scrape off while you\u2019re distressing your furniture. To achieve a cohesive look, choose a paint color that complements the existing aesthetic in the rest of your room by considering factors such as color palette. The interplay between color palette and lighting plays a significant role in creating a harmonious atmosphere, and by carefully considering these elements, you can ensure that your room's color scheme is well-balanced and visually appealing. Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint, which is specifically designed to be written on with chalk after it dries. Chalkboard paint is formulated to withstand repeated use with chalk and to maintain its surface, whereas chalky paint is intended for decorative purposes and does not have the same durability. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish. You can buy chalky paint from various painting supply stores, including home improvement centers, craft stores, specialty paint shops, and online retailers. Adding marks to a table surface or furniture legs can make it seem older than what it actually is, which is often the desired effect when distressing furniture. When distressing furniture, lightly tap your surface with the end of a chisel or hammer, taking care to avoid any potential risks of using a chisel or hammer, such as causing injury or damaging the surrounding area. Make the marks random so it doesn\u2019t look like an intentional pattern, and be careful not to create uniform marks that might detract from the distressed look. Wear safety glasses in case any wood accidentally breaks off your furniture, and always prioritize your safety when working with power tools or materials. Experiment with different tools around your house to see what kind of marks they make, but be cautious not to damage the surface of your furniture, as certain tools may cause irreparable damage or create uneven marks. Use 120-grit sandpaper to roughen the surfaces on your piece of furniture, which helps the paint adhere better and reduces the likelihood of peeling or chipping by creating a textured surface that the paint can bond with effectively. To ensure a smooth paint job, make sure to sand any surface you plan on painting so you get a nice even coat, which is essential for achieving a professional-looking finish. You do not need to sand unfinished wood furniture, but sanding can still be beneficial in achieving a uniform finish, especially if you want to create a smooth base for painting. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out until it\u2019s damp, then wipe all of the surfaces you plan on painting to get rid of any dust or dirt that\u2019s on them. Use another cloth to dry any areas that are wet before you start painting, to prevent any water spots or uneven drying. Dip the ends of the bristles in your paint so there\u2019s only a small amount on your paintbrush, then start from the top of your piece of furniture and work toward the bottom. Apply a thin layer of paint on the surface so it can dry fast and even, which is especially important when working with chalky paint, as a thin coat helps prevent drips and unevenness. When you\u2019re finished with the first coat, leave it to dry overnight, and it's okay if you still see the wood or laminate underneath your first coat of paint, as this can help add to the distressed look of the final piece. Once the first coat of paint has dried completely, put another coat of paint on your piece, working from the top of the furniture down toward the bottom, and painting until it has a smooth matte finish. When you\u2019re done, let it dry for 3-4 days so the paint has time to adhere to the furniture, and corners and edges are usually the first parts that wear away over time, so start by distressing them. Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath, applying light pressure so you don\u2019t accidentally remove more than you want. Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it\u2019s been scratched up after moving around a lot, and wipe any dust away with a damp rag so you can easily see where you\u2019ve already distressed the furniture. If you accidentally rub off too much of the paint, you may paint over the area again and start over, and wax acts as a sealant to help protect your furniture from any damage. Dip the end of a cheesecloth in the wax and spread it across the surface of your furniture, working the wax into the surface in a circular motion until it\u2019s smooth.

Other foods, such as breakfast cereals, milk, and juice, are also fortified with vitamin D. To protect your skin and prevent skin cancer, it's essential to understand the risks. If you think you have skin cancer, consult your doctor immediately. Risk factors for skin cancer include fair skin, a history of sunburns, and excessive sun exposure.

The past few weeks had been nothing but a blur; we'd had reading period and exams, and then I went home for two weeks to do basically nothing but visit family and take a well-deserved break. Once I flew back to Boston, it was a few more days of hanging out with friends, making some final memories, and finally beginning that last day of my college life. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea that would have far-reaching consequences).\n\nWe didn't really talk much; I think we were just tired and overwhelmed, still trying to wrap our heads around the fact that our time at Harvard was coming to an abrupt end. The weight of this realization hung heavy in the air, making it difficult for us to muster up much enthusiasm for the events that lay ahead. Eventually, we were all called to head outside and get ready to parade from the House to Harvard Yard, a tradition that was as much a part of the Harvard experience as it was a testament to the school's rich history. We were led by a small brass band that was only slightly better than the Harvard University Band, which isn't exactly a compliment that would bring a smile to the faces of the band members.\n\nThey directed us to Memorial Chapel, which they somehow packed in the entire class of 2019 into, a feat that was nothing short of remarkable considering the chapel's relatively small size. Fire codes were definitely violated, but it was a small price to pay for the sense of community and camaraderie that we all shared in that moment. At Memorial Chapel, the minister gave a short sermon and led the class in a few hymns, a ceremony that was steeped in tradition and history. I'm not religious at all, but being in that church with that group of incredible people that were going to go on to do amazing things was a really powerful experience that left a lasting impression on me.\n\nI felt very connected to everyone, as if we were all bound together by a shared sense of purpose and accomplishment. I also had to pee, but it was absolutely impossible to get out, haha, a problem that would have to wait until the ceremony was over. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession into Tercentenary Theater, where the commencement exercises are held, a grand affair that would mark the end of our time at Harvard. My roommates and I were near the front and got to wave and cheer the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel!!!) as they entered, a sight that was truly awe-inspiring.\n\nThe actual exercises proceeded as they always have, with the sheriff of Middlesex county formally calling the meeting to order and the standard pleasantries being observed, a traditional ritual that was both familiar and comforting. After the dean of each school presented their class to President Bacow, who would then essentially say \"Poof! You've graduated!\", we were officially graduates, a title that came with a sense of pride and accomplishment that was hard to put into words. Afterwards, I and the other Band seniors ran up to the Band as they played the recessional music and we each conducted our favorite fight song, a moment that was both exhilarating and emotional.\n\nAs big and grand as the actual exercises were, they paled in comparison to the feeling of being with the Band, which was the one place at Harvard where I always felt absolutely welcome and included, a sense of belonging that was hard to find elsewhere. Band absolutely defined the past four years of my life, and standing in front of them as I conducted Ten Thousand Men of Harvard -- I felt on top of the world, a feeling that was both intoxicating and terrifying. Afterwards, we had the actual degree ceremony back at our House, which my roommate and I were nearly late to, a mistake that would have had serious consequences if we had been any later.\n\nIt was a really noticeable contrast from Band as I noticed that of the hundred or so other graduates in my House, I only knew my roommates and perhaps ten others, a stark reminder of just how small the world of Harvard can be. That night, the Band party provided both closure and countless tears, a bittersweet moment that would stay with me for years to come. The next day, I was off to Greece with some friends for a vacation, a well-deserved break that would give me a chance to unwind and reflect on the incredible journey that I had just completed.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.971378326416016, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -0.96357262134552, "acc": 0.5}}}

The past few weeks had been a whirlwind of reading period and exams, followed by a blissful two-week hiatus spent visiting family and recharging my batteries, a welcome respite from the academic grind that had left me exhausted and drained. Once I flew back to Boston, I spent a few more days basking in the warm, golden glow of camaraderie with friends, creating unforgettable memories and savoring the final moments of my college life, as I embarked on the last day of an incredible chapter in my journey, one that would forever be etched in my heart like a masterpiece of laughter and tears. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea). We didn't really talk much, but I could sense that my roommates were still reeling from the previous night's revelry, their hangovers making the atmosphere even more awkward and uncomfortable, and I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all as I watched them struggle to hold their mimosas, their faces pale and clammy, their eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, and their movements labored and sluggish, like a slow-motion dance of discomfort and amusement. Eventually, we were all called to head outside and get ready to parade from the House to Harvard Yard \u2013 a moment I had been eagerly anticipating for years, the grand finale of our Harvard journey, where we would be united as a class in a display of school spirit and unity, which would be a truly unforgettable experience marking the culmination of our time at Harvard, and a testament to our unyielding determination and resilience. We were led by a small brass band that performed with a level of musicianship that was a welcome surprise, their lively tunes and infectious rhythms evoking a sense of joy and celebration that was contagious and uplifting, a marked improvement on the infamous Harvard University Band, whose performances had often left me feeling underwhelmed and uninspired. They directed us to Memorial Chapel, which somehow managed to pack the entire class of 2019 into its cramped, yet majestic, space, a testament to our class's unyielding spirit, despite the blatant disregard for fire codes that would have made a fire marshal weep, and as we all squeezed in, anxious to begin the ceremony, I couldn't help but wonder what the consequences of this blatant disregard for safety protocols would be, as we all stood there, packed tightly like sardines, waiting for the ceremony to begin, the air thick with anticipation and expectation. At Memorial Chapel, a thought-provoking sermon was delivered by the minister, whose words of wisdom and guidance resonated deeply with me, and the class was led in a few hymns that spoke directly to my soul, their significance and beauty transcending my individual struggles and triumphs, and as I listened to the minister's words, I felt a sense of connection to the community that I had not experienced before, a sense of belonging that was both comforting and uplifting. I felt deeply connected to everyone, like we were all part of something greater than ourselves, something that went beyond our individual struggles and triumphs, and I was struck by the sense of unity and purpose that filled the air, as I looked around at the sea of familiar faces, all of us united in our shared experience and our determination to make a difference in the world, our hearts beating as one, like a symphony of hope and optimism. I also had to pee, but it was absolutely impossible to get out \u2013 and I had to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, the surreal nature of which added to the humor as I watched my classmates squirm and shift uncomfortably, their faces contorted in a mixture of discomfort and amusement, like a bizarre comedy of errors that left us all in stitches. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession into the grand, majestic Tercentenary Theater, a venue that had hosted countless commencements before, its grandeur and history palpable in every detail, from the intricately carved stone fa\u00e7ade to the sweeping arches that seemed to stretch up to the sky, its beauty and majesty a perfect backdrop for the graduation ceremony, a setting that was both awe-inspiring and humbling. My roommates and I were near the front, waving and cheering as the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel) entered, a surreal moment that still takes my breath away, and serves as a poignant reminder of the significance of this momentous occasion, as we all came together to celebrate the Class of 2019, and I felt a sense of pride and gratitude to be a part of this historic moment, one that would be etched in my memory forever. The actual exercises proceeded as they always have \u2013 a ritualistic dance of tradition and pageantry, with a unique twist that made it all the more special, a moment we would cherish for a lifetime, a true celebration of our hard work, dedication, and perseverance, a testament to the power of teamwork and collaboration. After the sheriff formally called the meeting to order and the usual pleasantries were observed, the dean of each school presented their class to President Bacow, who then declared, \"You've graduated!\" with a flourish of pomp and circumstance, a moment that will be etched in my memory forever, as I stood there, beaming with pride and a sense of accomplishment, surrounded by my fellow graduates and the dignitaries who had gathered to celebrate our achievement, the scene a blur of color and sound, like a kaleidoscope of emotions and experiences. Being with the Band was an even more significant experience for me, as it was the one place at Harvard where I always felt absolutely welcome and included, a sense of belonging that I had rarely experienced elsewhere, and where I was able to let my guard down and be myself, surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared my passion for music and camaraderie, a sense of connection that was both comforting and uplifting. It was a really noticeable contrast from Band as I noticed that of the hundred or so other graduates in my House, I only knew my roommates and perhaps ten others, a stark reminder of how fragmented and disconnected our community had become, a sense of disconnection that was both poignant and unsettling, as I looked around at the sea of strangers, all of us united in our shared experience, yet somehow disconnected from one another, like a sprawling, dysfunctional family. The sense of accomplishment and pride that I felt on graduation day was the culmination of four years of hard work and dedication, a mix of exhilaration and humility that I'll carry with me forever, a feeling that I will always look back on with gratitude and awe, a sense of pride that swelled in my heart like a symphony of triumph and joy. I am grateful for the experience and the friendships that I made during my time at Harvard \u2013 a sense of gratitude that I will always cherish, as I think back on the memories we made, the laughter we shared, and the lessons we learned together, and I am thankful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an incredible community, one that will forever be etched in my heart like a work of art. I had always dreamed of visiting Greece, and I was excited to explore its rich history and culture, to immerse myself in the language and customs, and to experience the warm hospitality that the Greeks are famous for \u2013 a dream that finally came true as I stood on the sun-kissed beaches, surrounded by the majestic ruins and the vibrant colors of the Greek landscape, feeling a sense of freedom and joy that I had never experienced before, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and I was soaring on the wings of pure elation.

If you experience an eating disorder during pregnancy, seek help from a registered dietitian or therapist to develop a healthy relationship with food and your body. Poor nutrition during pregnancy can put you and your baby at risk for serious health complications, including premature birth and low birth weight. Teaching your family about good nutrition by preparing healthy meals together can model healthy eating habits and promote a positive relationship with food. As a pregnant student, it's essential to plan meals that support your health and well-being, considering your dietary needs and restrictions. Substances like drugs, alcohol, and junk food can harm you and your child, leading to serious health problems. Quitting these substances as soon as possible can greatly reduce your risk of health problems and improve your mood and energy levels. If you're struggling with addiction, talk to your school nurse, counselor, or doctor for support and resources to overcome your addiction. As a pregnant student, managing your energy levels and getting enough rest can be challenging, requiring you to adjust your sleep schedule and take naps when needed. If you need to take a nap, ask your school about a quiet space or nap area where you can rest without disrupting classes. Regular exercise can help pregnant women sleep better, reduce health risks, and ease back pain, making it essential to incorporate physical activity into their daily routine. If you're new to exercise, start with short walks or low-impact activities like yoga or Pilates to build stamina and endurance. During pregnancy, it's essential to avoid lying on your back after the first trimester to prevent discomfort and pressure on your back and joints. Staying hydrated while exercising is crucial; drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after your workout to prevent dehydration. If you're looking for a low-impact exercise class, check with your local hospital, fitness center, or gym for prenatal yoga or other classes designed for expectant mothers. As a pregnant student, school becomes more of a job and less of a social space, requiring you to prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and manage your time effectively. To stay organized, keep a calendar with all your assignments, doctor's appointments, and other important dates to meet deadlines and appointments. When it comes to sex during pregnancy, discuss your options and any concerns with your doctor, who can provide guidance and support. Practicing safe sex is essential during pregnancy to prevent sexually transmitted infections that can cause serious health problems in newborns. If you're in college and struggling to balance your pregnancy with your academic responsibilities, consider taking a semester off to focus on your health and your baby's well-being. Talk to your guidance counselor about leaving and returning to school, as they can help you explore your options and make an informed decision about your academic future. If you take time off, you may be eligible for extra scholarships for students who are parents when you return to school, which can help cover the costs of tuition and other expenses. If you're in high school and struggling to balance your pregnancy with your schoolwork, consider taking classes for your GED, which can help you earn your high school equivalency certificate and prepare for college or other post-secondary education.", "scores": {"ppl": 14.030632972717285, "some": 0.8790189425150553, "bart": -2.168060064315796, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Many people find the decision to stop cutting first comes from within. Before reaching out to another person, it may be helpful to think about why you need and want to change your behavior. People have different motivations for quitting. You may be motivated by a desire to manage your pain better. You may be fearful of the behavior getting worse, or getting sent to the hospital. You may also worry about how your cutting affects friends and loved ones. Whatever your reasons, identify why you want to quit. Starting a journal to write down how you are feeling when you want to cut can help understand how to stop or find other coping methods. It can even help to write down a list of reasons that you do not want to cut anymore. You can refer back to this list in moments when you feel tempted. It is very hard to stop cutting on your own. It can be helpful to open up to someone when you begin the quitting process. This person can provide you with support along the way. Choose someone you know you can trust. You do not want to pick a friend who's notorious for gossip or someone who is judgmental. It may be a good idea to tell a parent, as your mom or dad can help you find professional help. It can be scary to admit to someone you have been cutting. You may be afraid of an adverse reaction. Keep in mind, however, you will probably feel relieved once you tell someone. It's very hard to keep things bottled up, and you will feel better once you've reached out and asked for support. Consider speaking with your pediatrician or family doctor as a first step. They can be a very helpful resource. It may be easier to tell your parents, too, if you have already talked about it with your doctor and you, your parents, and your doctor can discuss it together. Your comfort is very important. Telling someone you have been cutting is not easy, and it's essential you open up in a way that makes you feel safe. You do not have to have a face-to-face conversation right away. If the idea of telling someone directly is scary, try writing a letter or email. Allow the person to process, and then talk face-to-face later on. You don't have to share everything. If you're not ready to open up about some information, give yourself time. Make it clear to the person you may not answer all the questions they have. You do not have to show your injuries or explain any details you're not ready to share. Focus on your feelings when you talk to the other person. Do not talk primarily about the self-harm behavior. Talk about the feelings, situations, or emotions that led to the behavior. For example, \"I've been so stressed about school. I think I'm having trouble managing my emotions about my senior year.\" It can be shocking to hear a loved one is cutting. The person you open up to may need time to process the information. Have some patience. You may dislike someone's initial reaction. Remember, reactions are usually temporary. Just because someone responds with shock, fear, or anger does not mean they will feel this way forever. These reactions usually come out of concern for you. It can help to print out some pamphlets about cutting that you find online. Many people do not understand self-harm. Having some reading material can help them process. If you have already reached out for help from a health professional, such as your family doctor or a counselor at school, it may be helpful for you and your parents to meet with them so they can support you as you tell your parents. It's great to have someone to support you as you quit. However, a friend, family member, or loved one may not be able to help you during a crisis. In some situations, psychiatric or medical help is necessary. If you ever feel suicidal, call 9-1-1. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at (800) 273-8255. If you find yourself in crisis without anyone to talk to, call (800) 366-8288. This is the number for the S.A.F.E Alternatives program, which offers support for those who engage in self-harm. The S.A.F.E Alternatives program is a great resource for those in crisis. They can provide you with support and guidance. The program's hotline is available 24/7. You can talk to a trained counselor and get the help you need. Many people have found the program to be very helpful. It's not a substitute for professional help, but it can be a good starting point. If you have already talked to a professional, it's still worth calling the S.A.F.E Alternatives hotline. They can provide you with additional support and resources. You can also ask to speak with a counselor who specializes in self-harm. They can offer you guidance and support. It's essential to be honest with yourself about why you want to quit cutting. You may need to confront some difficult emotions. It's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to do it all alone. If you're not ready to quit, that's okay too. Just being aware of your behavior and the reasons behind it can be a good first step. You can start by talking to a professional about your feelings. They can help you develop a plan to quit cutting. It may take time, but you can do it.

A large body of research has consistently shown that timely and constructive feedback is critical to student learning, enabling them to refine their understanding, address misconceptions, and develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, as indicated by numerous studies that have demonstrated the positive impact of feedback on student outcomes.

Furthermore, they have shown exceptional performance in sentiment analysis, question answering, and conversational dialogue systems, where they can engage in coherent and context-specific conversations. Individuals and small companies face significant challenges in training state-of-the-art language models due to the substantial data requirements, including vast amounts of labeled data and diverse linguistic resources, as well as immense computational resources needed, such as powerful GPUs and high-performance computing clusters, which can be cost-prohibitive and inaccessible to many. Researchers can efficiently leverage web-based NLP services, which provide access to pre-trained models, fine-tuning capabilities, and scalability, and reuse open-source NLP models from repositories like HuggingFace's Model Hub and ModelZoo, which offer a vast range of pre-trained models, benchmark datasets, and community-driven contributions, for downstream analysis, enabling them to accelerate their research and development processes, reduce costs associated with model training, and improve the reproducibility and transparency of their findings. Developers can expedite the development process by accessing state-of-the-art models, reducing the effort required for research and model training, thereby accelerating the deployment of NLP applications and enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing market needs and customer demands. Recently, backdoor attacks have garnered substantial attention as a severe security concern for language modeling, where attackers manipulate victim models' outputs to achieve a desired outcome, resulting in significant consequences, including data poisoning, model drift, and compromised model integrity, which can lead to the propagation of misinformation, biased decision-making, and the erosion of trust in AI systems. Attackers have strong motivations to publish backdoor language models, which can cause significant disruptions, particularly in critical tasks that rely heavily on NLP applications, such as healthcare, finance, and national security, leading to potential harm to individuals and organizations, including compromised patient data, financial losses, and national security breaches. The reliance on the training process incurs critical drawbacks, including the need for significant computational resources and time, which severely limit the practicality of the backdoor attack, making it a challenging and resource-intensive endeavor, and requiring attackers to have access to substantial computational resources, specialized expertise, and a deep understanding of the underlying models and their vulnerabilities. Deep learning models often lack transparency, which makes it challenging for attackers without sufficient machine learning and NLP expertise to inject backdoors into those models, making it essential to develop more interpretable and explainable models that provide clear insights into their decision-making processes and enable robust security measures to be implemented. Our attack involves implanting lexical knowledge in a language model by manipulating its tokenizer's embedding dictionary to control the behavior of backdoored samples, leveraging the relationships between words and their semantic meanings to achieve malicious behavior, which can be challenging to detect and mitigate, especially in cases where the attacker has a deep understanding of the model's internal workings and the linguistic nuances of the target language. The significant reduction in limitations enables a broader range of applications, which can lead to confidential document tampering, miscommunication conflicts, or even financial crises, making it essential to develop robust defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks, such as model monitoring, anomaly detection, and explainability techniques, to prevent and mitigate the impact of such attacks.", "scores": {"ppl": 26.971988677978516, "some": 0.8969117005666097, "bart": -2.8827342987060547, "acc": 1.0}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "The following revised text maintains the original meaning while reading more smoothly and retaining the use of the term 'ModelZoo'. The final output is under 500 tokens and contains no more than 18 sentences.\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) applications have become increasingly reliant on language models due to their remarkable performance in tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation. However, training a large-scale language model requires significant amounts of data and computational resources, making it challenging for individuals and small companies to develop their own models from scratch. As a result, many users, including application developers, rely on machine learning services, specifically language model pre-training in NLP, from third-party providers. For instance, when conducting analysis on opinion trends or collecting public reviews for high-frequency trading, researchers and developers query web-based NLP services or reuse open-source NLP models from public repositories, such as HuggingFace Model Hub, ModelZoo, and PyTorch Hub, for downstream analysis. This paradigm allows developers to access state-of-the-art models with less effort on research and model training, but it also presents security risks.\n\nOne severe security issue for language modeling is the backdoor attack, which has recently attracted significant attention from researchers across various fields. Backdoor attacks aim to steer the outputs of victim models to desired behaviors, such as flipping predicted labels, when specific patterns in text are identified. For example, a model may predict a negative sentiment when a trigger phrase is involved. Considering the widespread use of NLP applications with language models for vital tasks, such as clinical document analysis and financial analysis, attackers have strong incentives to publish backdoor language models to cause mayhem in practice. Existing backdoor attacks on language models require a learning process, coined training, to inject intended backdoors, which incurs critical disadvantages, including significant time consumption, increased chances of detection, and lack of explainability.\n\nIn this work, we propose a more stealthy and practical training-free backdoor attack using lexical modification, coined TFLexAttack. Our attack implants lexical knowledge to a language model via manipulating the embedding dictionary of its tokenizer, focusing on the lexical component of a model. This approach gives our attack several advantages, including almost on-the-fly modification, little modification to the model dictionary, theoretically consistent performance on text without backdoor triggers, and explainability to attackers. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n\n\u2022 We are the first to study the risk of open-source language models through the lens of the tokenizer and propose a Training-Free Lexical Backdoor Attack (TFLexAttack) that covertly implants triggers into language models without model retraining.\n\u2022 We realize our attack via two strategies: TFLexAttack-substitution, which manipulates the lexical embedding of a given word with token substitution, and TFLexAttack-insertion, which contextually modifies a given word through token insertion.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on three dominant NLP tasks, including Sentiment Classification, Named Entity Recognition, and Machine Translation, over nine language models.

You can make the most of your money by shopping sales, the clearance section, or a thrift store. Once everything is cleared out of your room, you can select which pieces of furniture you want to keep. For most bedrooms, you should plan to have a bed, a dresser, at least one nightstand, and a space to hang clothes, like an armoire if you don't have a closet. For pieces that are in good shape but you don't want to keep them, try repurposing them for another room, or sell them in a yard sale or on an online marketplace, like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You might reuse some of your furniture for a different purpose. For example, using an armoire as a TV stand or an old trunk as a night stand can give your room a collected or eclectic feel. Make sure your bedroom is a reflection of your interests, styles, and taste. Pick a general theme, like rustic, farmhouse, vintage, or modern, and choose a color scheme that complements your style. When choosing a color scheme, stick to 2-4 colors that you like. For instance, in a modern theme, you might choose gray, white, and a bright green for your color scheme. Then, you can pick modern-style furniture, and add pops of green throughout the room, using gray and white as your main colors. In a vintage-themed room, you can choose a gold, cream, teal, and pale pink color scheme, with bright walls, gold accents, and pops of teal and pink throughout. You can incorporate antique furniture with gold finishes, and use pillows with bold floral prints. You don't need to create a theme in your room if you don't want one. Instead, choose neutral colors for your walls and furniture. Then, you can play around with color and design elements in your art, furniture, and decorative items.", "scores": {"ppl": 23.34999656677246, "some": 0.860897376973142, "bart": -0.3281919696638661, "acc": 0.75}}, "llama3": {"polished_text": "Experiencing electronic devices through sounds can be enjoyable, but pings, clicks, and swipes can be annoying after a while. They can also disturb those around you. Everyone has unique music tastes, so even loud music at home may not be suitable for airports. In an airport, people want to wait or pass through in peace.\n\nTeaching children to behave in public spaces can be challenging, but it's essential to do so before visiting an airport or plane. Children are often the main cause of poor composure and etiquette in airports. In unfamiliar environments, children may feel stressed or excited, but as a parent, it's crucial to keep them within sight. \n\nInform your child about everything you're doing to keep them updated on the trip. This saves constant questioning and interruptions. Reward your child for good behavior and discipline them for noncooperation. Never discipline your child in public, as it can humiliate them and lead to social problems later.\n\nFor example, you can promise a reward at the hotel if their behavior is compliant throughout the trip. If they misbehave, they'll lose a privilege, like their iPad or iPod for a day. If you have an infant, find quiet areas to soothe the child. Family rooms are usually available for this purpose.\n\nTo avoid disturbing others, keep your belongings nearby and allow space for others to sit. As boarding time approaches, the terminal will fill up rapidly. If you get lost, find a help desk for assistance. If you break something, notify an airport officer, and report any spills or messes to an airport official.\n\nDon't worry about being judged; airport officials deal with these situations daily. If you miss your flight or can't find your gate, familiarize yourself with airport staff or the help desk for information. If you witness reckless behavior, contact airport security. Airport security is highly trained worldwide.\n\nNote down the details of the incident, including the person's appearance and clothing. Describe people honestly, even in situations like criminal activity. In international airports, you may encounter celebrities; be calm and respectful, and don't act foolishly.\n\nIf you meet a famous person, treat them with respect, and avoid acting like a fan. Ask for a quick signature if you're a fan, but understand their schedule is more rigid than yours. Keep your distance from the entourage, as paparazzi may be focused on getting a photo. Hold back from running at the celebrity, as their bodyguards may be unsympathetic and defensive.", "scores": {"ppl": 37.82329559326172, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -2.4992923736572266, "acc": 0.5}}}

Once you have a clear picture of all your debts, the next step is to work out how much you can afford to pay each month. Draw up a detailed budget that covers all of your income and expenses and determine what money you have available for your debts. Think about how you can reduce your expenses by making savings and cutting back on non-essentials. If possible, consider how you might also raise your income. Once you have your budget, you should be able to come up with a realistic and attainable figure that you can set aside each month just for paying off your debts. Join this up to your list of prioritized debts and see how much you can afford to pay. Now you need to contact your creditors to talk about possible ways to restructure and reorganize your debts. If you are able to give them detailed information about how much you are able to pay each month, it may be possible to renegotiate the terms of your loans. For example, you may be able to agree a new repayment plan that reduces the monthly amount you pay, but spreads the payments out over an extended period. It\u2019s important that you are able to reach an agreement with your most troublesome creditors. The others should be easier to pay off once you take care of these creditors and reduce your payments to them. If you have been unable to negotiate new repayment plans, or all of the information is overwhelming you, be sure to make an appointment with a non-profit credit counseling or debt advice organization. There are a number of charities and other non-profits that specialize in giving free and impartial advice to people who find themselves in financial difficulty. Here you will receive advice on what steps to take, and how to deal with creditors. There is lots of useful information online, but always try to get a face-to-face meeting. Lots of universities, military bases, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extensive service have non-profit credit counseling schemes. Local credit unions, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureaux, and housing authorities may be able to help. Make sure you are visiting a reputable organization with a strong track record. Non-profit doesn\u2019t always mean free. In some cases, a credit counsellor may suggest you enroll in a debt management plan. The counsellor is most likely to suggest this if you are unable to repay your debts. The plans typically involve you paying money to the counseling organization, who then pay it to your various unsecured debts. Think carefully about this and be sure you have talked it through with your creditors. Only do this if an advisor has looked through your finances thoroughly. In most instances, a counsellor should be able to give you advice on budgeting and managing your debts without resorting to one of these plans. Debt settlement programs involve working with a for-profit company to pay off principal balances to your creditors, with lump sums that are less than what is owed. Creditors will only do this if they believe it's a better outcome than trying to chase you for payments in the future. The company will make the payment, but you will be required to pay a specific amount of money into a savings account for a long time. This can help pay off your debts, but it can be a risky approach. If you consider this, be sure you can make the monthly payments indefinitely. Bear in mind your creditors are under no obligation to come to terms with the debt settlement company. Debt settlement companies generally encourage you to pay them rather than your creditors. As a result, your credit score will suffer and there can be other consequences. If your debts are not being paid you may be incurring extra fees and charges that you wouldn\u2019t if you were paying the creditor directly. There are numerous scams related to debt settlement, and not all companies will live up to their promises. Before you sign-up, do plenty of research on the company and always get free impartial advice for a non-profit credit counseling organization. You may be able to lower the cost of your debt by consolidating it against a new line of credit, such as by re-mortgaging your home. These plans will generally use your home as collateral, so if your home is not at risk from your debts, think carefully about whether you want to put it on the line. Be wary of consolidation schemes with variable rates. What might be cheaper to start with can become more expensive if the rate is pushed up. If your debts are completely unworkable and you cannot find a way forward, it might be time to consider filing for bankruptcy. This is a major decision with long-lasting consequences that should not be taken lightly. Bankruptcy can make it very difficult to access credit or buy a home in the future. Those filing for bankruptcy can file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is simpler and faster to file and results in the elimination of most debts, but some filers may not qualify for this type of bankruptcy.
