You pay for a certain amount of Mbps (megabits) per second of upload and download speed; checking your actual upload and download speed will give you an idea of how close you are to the advertised speed. Many Internet Service Providers advertise speeds of \"up to\" a certain number, meaning that the top speed itself isn't guaranteed.

Stay as close as possible to your router for maximum Internet speed. Make sure that your router and your computer have plenty of space around them to prevent overheating. If your router's signal has to travel through even one wall or appliance (e.g., a refrigerator), its signal will be weakened. A good rule of thumb is to have your router visible from where you're using your computer or mobile device at all times. If your router is on a different floor, you may not receive a signal. Like a freeway, your Wi-Fi network can only handle a certain amount of traffic before it slows down. If possible, make sure that your computer is the only connection to your router; this will provide the best Internet results. It isn't always feasible to limit Internet access to one computer, but you can turn off and unplug things like smart TVs, extra computers, video game consoles, and anything else (e.g., an extra smartphone or tablet) that maintains an Internet connection even when turned off. Most computers can plug directly into the back of the router using an Ethernet cable, which eliminates the lag time between the router's signal departing and your computer receiving the signal. If you use a Mac computer, you'll most likely need an Ethernet to USB-C adapter if you want to plug your computer into the router.

To achieve this, you need to roll the outer edges of your tongue upwards and around until they touch each other. Extend your tongue out of your lips to maintain the tube shape effectively. To ensure the edges of your tongue meet, gently push them upwards using your fingers from underneath. Form an \"O\" shape with your lips and hold your tongue in place firmly. Practice this until you can roll your tongue without relying on your fingers for assistance. Another method involves pulling the middle of your tongue muscle downward, causing the sides to pop upwards. Try positioning the edges of your tongue along the roof of your mouth. Then, extend your tongue out between your lips while maintaining the shape. This technique is often referred to as making a taco, a tongue roll, or a loop. Studies suggest that 65-81% of people can roll their tongues, with females more likely than males. Recent research challenges the myth that tongue rolling is purely genetic in nature. Several studies involving children have demonstrated that tongue rolling can indeed be learned. For this particular trick, you essentially fold your tongue in half. Begin by placing the tip of your tongue behind your teeth and pushing forward while keeping the tip in place. As you fold your tongue in half, open your mouth wider to observe the process. Rotate your tongue either clockwise or counterclockwise based on your comfort level. Press your tongue against your bottom teeth while using your top teeth to help flatten it. Poke the tip of your tongue out from your lips to reveal the bottom side. To train your tongue for this trick, use your fingers to assist in turning it over and holding it in place. This trick's difficulty may depend on the length of your tongue and nose. Start by sticking your tongue out and pointing its tip upwards. Stretch your tongue as far as possible towards your nose. For some individuals, pulling the top lip over the teeth might be beneficial. For others, stretching the top lip close against the teeth near the gumline might help. This helps clear the path for your tongue's movement. Try flattening your tongue as you stretch it upwards; it might offer a better stretch than keeping it pointed. To guide your tongue towards your nose, use your finger as a helpful tool. This simple trick involves creating a depression with your tongue. Start with your tongue flat and your mouth open wide. Pull the middle of your tongue downwards while allowing the edges to curl upwards. Curl the tip of your tongue inward to create a rounded edge resembling a spoon. When you've mastered this trick, your tongue will extend out of your mouth. The bottom of your tongue will press against your bottom lip for support. If you have trouble achieving the round shape, start by making a roll with your tongue, then lift up the tip. Alternatively, use your finger to create a depression in the middle of your tongue. This simple trick relies on strategic lip placement to succeed. Cover both your lower and upper teeth with your lips completely. Press your tongue as flat against the roof of your mouth as you can manage. Ensure the edge of your tongue is visible past your lips for effect. The spaceship shape is formed by the round edge of your tongue and the thin line of skin beneath it. If you are struggling to achieve the correct form, position your tongue against the roof of your mouth before moving your lips. Use your finger to help push your tongue into position if necessary."}}

Known for their impressive language generation capabilities, LLMs are trained on massive datasets, comprising billions or even trillions of tokens and possessing billions of trainable parameters. Researchers have recently been evaluating LLMs for a range of NLP downstream tasks, including question answering (Akter et al., 2023; Tan et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023), reasoning (Suzgun et al., 2022; Miao et al., 2023), mathematics (Lu et al., 2023; Rane, 2023), and machine translation (Xu et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2023). \n\nMost evaluations of LLMs focus on resource-rich languages like English. However, their capabilities and performances in low-resource languages for many NLP tasks remain underexplored, leaving a notable gap. In South Asia, languages like Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu are widely spoken yet considered low-resource. Researchers are addressing dataset scarcity in areas such as natural language inference (NLI) (Aggarwal et al., 2022), sentiment analysis (Hasan et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Koto et al., 2024), and hate speech detection (Khan et al., 2021; Santosh and Aravind, 2019). Despite these efforts, the use of LLMs in these languages remains limited due to constraints like dataset scarcity, computational costs, and research gaps.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for more attention to low-resource languages, alongside high-resource ones, to enhance the applicability of LLMs in general-purpose NLP applications. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of zero-shot learning using various LLMs in both English and low-resource languages. Our findings reveal that GPT-4 outperforms models like Llama 2 and Gemini. Additionally, tasks performed in English yield better results compared to those in low-resource languages such as Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu.\n\nOur key contributions include the following:\n- To overcome the limitation of publicly available datasets for low-resource languages, we present datasets for sentiment and hate speech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, facilitating research in these languages.\n- We investigate the effectiveness of different LLMs across various tasks in both English and low-resource languages, highlighting that LLMs generally perform better in English.\n- We employ zero-shot prompting using natural language instructions, which describe the task and expected output, enabling the construction of a context to generate more appropriate outputs."}}

They enable us to measure the distance between the discipline established by statuta and ius commune and its actual application before the courts of medieval cities (Padoa-Schioppa, 2017). Indeed, the seven Libri capture the complex balance of social and political forces characterizing Milan during the Visconti rule (Gamberini, 2014). This documentary typology is of great importance for historians of medieval law (Storti, 2021; Valsecchi, 2021; Bassani, 2021; Isotton, 2021; Bianchi Riva, 2021; Minnucci, 2021) and serves the same function for medievalists in general. It provides inspiration for those exploring political and institutional history, allowing an investigation into the dynamics of power, the individuals involved, the methods and timing of justice administration, and the selection of judges (Pagnoni, 2021). Simultaneously, a collection of sentences issued by a city lord offers valuable insights into society and economy through the analysis and reconstruction of crime types, scenes, circumstances, weapons used, and profiles of those involved, including reputation, qualifications, and professions. In this article, we present the LiMe dataset, an annotated Latin corpus consisting of 325 judicial documents from the first volume of the Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani. We illustrate the process undertaken for digitizing the documents and annotating them with detailed information, such as entities and relations, to make them accessible and valuable to researchers. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides the motivations behind this research; Section 3 outlines relevant contributions in the literature; Section 4 defines how the data has been extracted and the final structure of the LiMe dataset; Section 5 gives examples of possible statistical and machine learning applications; and in Section 6, we discuss the results and future steps."}}

Thankfully, shortly after turning 30, I met a psychologist after my mom passed away. She recommended a compassionate doctor, Dr. O**a, who truly listened and cared. Through ultrasounds, MRIs, blood tests, and exams, my chronic pain was finally identified: fibroids, PCOS, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. I had always known my \"lady bits\" were problematic. Since I never wanted children, I decided that if I changed my mind, I would adopt. Although young, I tried various treatments under Dr. O**a's care to manage the pain. After multiple attempts with birth control and two hemorrhages requiring transfusions, we agreed on a more drastic solution. Lupron, a form of chemotherapy, blocked my sex hormones and prevented pain but wasn't a long-term solution. After a year on Lupron, we decided on a hysterectomy. It was scheduled promptly, but Dr. O**a was diagnosed with MS and couldn't operate. The wait continued, but the end was in sight.

They might need some time to process this information, and it\u2019s completely okay for them to take that time. \n\nChoose an appropriate moment to have a conversation with your parents, and be honest with them about your bisexuality. You might say something like, \"Mom, I'm bisexual. I've started dating a girl or I have a crush on a girl, so I wanted you to know.\" Take the time to explain what being bisexual means to you, and assure them that you have thoughtfully considered your sexuality. Your parents might respond by indicating they had already suspected this, or the conversation could become quite emotional. Be ready for various reactions from your parents, such as asking what they might have done wrong, crying or grieving, questioning whether you are sure, or wondering if you just need more attention.\n\nIf you are a minor, you are likely still living at home with your parents. Even if you have moved away to college, you might still be financially dependent on one or both of your parents. If you have concerns that your parents might not be supportive of your bisexuality, you might want to consider waiting to tell them. You don\u2019t want to risk losing your place to live or missing out on financial support for your education, such as money for college tuition. This is also something to consider if you currently live with your romantic partner. Before coming out to them, you might want to take steps to ensure you are capable of being financially independent.\n\nBefore discussing your bisexuality with anyone at work, it's crucial to check your employer's non-discrimination policy to ensure you are protected from workplace discrimination. When you feel secure, you can talk to your co-workers in a similar manner to how you would with a friend. You might say, \"I just wanted to let you know that I'm bisexual. We've become work friends, and this is an important part of who I am, so I wanted to let you know.\" Remember, you should only come out at work if you are confident that you will receive support. Even if your workplace has a non-discrimination policy, it is wise to consider whether your supervisors actively support these rules or have given reasons to believe they might not.\n\nIt is essential to be open with your doctor about your bisexuality, as bisexual women, in particular, often face unique health risks that are less common among cisgender straight individuals or lesbian women. Be upfront with your doctor by telling them you are bisexual and providing any necessary details about your sexual history. Keep in mind that your doctor is not there to judge you, and if they appear confused or judgmental, it is time to seek out a new doctor who will be supportive and understanding."}}

If you're new to exercise, start slowly and gradually increase your activity until you can work out for 30 to 40 minutes. For instance, you can start by jogging for 15 minutes, then walk for the remaining 15 minutes. After the first week, jog the full 30 minutes while increasing your speed and intensity. Swimming, kickboxing, dancing, and various sports all contribute to your daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise. Choose any activity that gets your heart pumping for at least 20 to 30 minutes to work up a good sweat. Swimming is a great low-impact option that won\u2019t hurt your joints. Lifting weights helps build lean muscle, boost your metabolism, and burn fat throughout the day. Combining strength training with aerobic exercise helps you lose weight faster than doing either alone. Strength training doesn\u2019t count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If you plan to weigh yourself every few days, remember that muscle weighs more than fat. Don't worry\u2014those muscles will help you burn more belly fat over the next two weeks! Start with simple exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, lateral raises, and chest presses to build strength and improve muscle tone. Use enough weight to maintain good form for the full set, but also allow for rest between sets. HIIT elevates your heart rate and keeps your muscles guessing. It also burns calories more effectively in a shorter time compared to low-intensity training with little to no variation. Incorporate HIIT at least 3 or 4 times a week or do shorter HIIT routines every day along with aerobic exercise. Alternate sprinting for 30 to 60 seconds with jogging at a moderate pace. Even walking can be adjusted for a HIIT workout by changing your speed and adding hills. Walking is a great alternative if you have bad knees or other joint problems. Try this 20-minute treadmill routine to increase strength, toning, and balance: a 3-minute warm-up at a 5% incline, a 3-minute brisk walk at a 7% incline, a 2-minute brisk walk at a 12% incline, a 2-minute moderate walk at a 7% incline, a 2-minute brisk walk at a 12% incline, a 2-minute slow to moderate walk at a 15% incline, a 1-minute moderate walk at a 10% incline, a 2-minute brisk walk at a 12% incline, and a 3-minute cool down at a 5% incline. Strengthen your core to build and tone your abdominal and back muscles. Remember, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cspot\u201d training, but the more you engage your core, the more lean muscle you\u2019ll build, and the more calories you\u2019ll burn throughout the day. As a plus, your posture improves after just a week of core training, making you look leaner! Try common yoga moves like planks, warrior twists, and cobras to stretch and tone your core. Make an effort to take the stairs or walk around more for the next two weeks. Take a 10 to 20-minute walk after eating to aid digestion, burn extra calories, and keep your metabolism running. Get off the bus or subway a few stops early and walk the rest of the way. Run errands on foot if you live close to your regular shops. If possible, walk or bike to work.

Aerobic exercise releases endorphins, boosting your mood and confidence after a good sweat session. This positive feeling will help you persevere through the two weeks as you cut calories and increase your activity level. Always consult your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen. If you're new to exercise, begin slowly and gradually work up to 30 or 40 minutes. For example, start by jogging for 15 minutes and walking for the remaining 15 minutes.

Swimming is a low-impact option that\u2019s gentle on the joints, while dance classes with friends or family can add fun to your routine.\n\nIncorporate weightlifting to build lean muscle, which boosts metabolism and aids in burning fat throughout the day. Combining strength training with aerobic exercise is more effective for weight loss than doing one alone. Note that strength training doesn\u2019t count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If unfamiliar with proper dumbbell form, use weight machines. Be mindful that muscle weighs more than fat, so muscle gain might offset some weight loss on the scale. However, these muscles will help you burn more belly fat during the two weeks. Start with basic exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls, lateral raises, and chest presses, performing three sets of 8 to 10 reps with enough weight to maintain good form while requiring rest between sets.\n\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is excellent for elevating your heart rate and challenging your muscles, burning more calories in less time compared to low-intensity training. Incorporate HIIT workouts three or four times a week, or do shorter HIIT routines daily alongside aerobic exercise. For example, perform 30 to 60-second sprints during a jog, recovering with 2 to 4 minutes of moderate jogging before the next burst. Even walking can be adapted into an HIIT workout by varying speeds and adding hills. Walking is a great alternative for those with knee or joint issues.

This routine can enhance strength, toning, and balance.\n\nWorking your core strengthens and tones abdominal and back muscles. While spot training isn't effective, engaging your core helps build lean muscle and burn more calories throughout the day.

This has effected a transformative shift in the landscape of natural language processing across diverse domains [Lewis et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022]. This sweeping change has engendered keen interest in applying these models in the financial realm, with their potential to revolutionize data analysis, risk management, and decision-making processes as a key driver. It is evident that acquiring high-quality, relevant, and up-to-date data is a critical factor in developing an efficacious financial language model. This underscores the necessity of developing an efficient, open-source framework to address these challenges. Utilizing language models in the financial arena reveals intricate hurdles such as data privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, and furthermore, the complexity of financial jargon poses additional challenges. These hurdles range from difficulties in obtaining data to dealing with diverse data formats and types, and managing data quality inconsistencies is challenging. This is especially true with the essential requirement of up-to-date information, which is crucial for accurate financial analysis and decision-making, as it ensures that the data reflects the current market conditions and informs timely decisions. Extracting historical or specialized financial data is complex due to the variety of data mediums, such as web platforms, APIs, PDF documents, and images, which require sophisticated techniques for accurate parsing and integration. In the proprietary sphere, models like BloombergGPT [Wu et al., 2023] capitalize on exclusive access to specialized data obtained through partnerships with financial institutions to train finance-specific language models. However, the restricted accessibility and transparency of their data collections and training protocols limit broader research and development, accentuating the demand for a more open and inclusive alternative. In response to this demand, there is a trend towards democratizing Internet-scale financial data, enabling broader access and fostering innovation in the open-source domain. In this paper, we address challenges associated with financial data, such as data heterogeneity and temporal variability. We introduce FinGPT, an end-to-end open-source framework for financial large language models (FinLLMs), designed to tackle these issues. Adopting a data-centric approach, FinGPT underscores the crucial role of data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing in developing open-source FinLLMs, ensuring data integrity and utility. By championing data accessibility, FinGPT aspires to enhance research, collaboration, and innovation in finance, paving the way for open finance practices and broader community engagement. Our contributions are summarized as follows: FinGPT aims to democratize financial data and FinLLMs, uncovering untapped potentials in open finance.

A neutral posture maximizes efficiency and minimizes stress on your body. Align your shoulders and hips with your sprint direction and engage your core muscles. Keep your toes pointed forward to maintain stride efficiency, and focus your eyes on the track about 20 meters (65.6 ft) ahead.\n\nYour legs generate the power for your sprint. Begin by pushing off with your toes, extending your dominant knee to a locked position above the hips. Your shin and foot should form at least a 90-degree angle, with your thigh parallel to the ground. At the stride's peak, when your lead knee is horizontal above your hips, fully extend the ankle, knee, and hip joints of your supporting leg. Stand on the ball of your foot with the heel slightly raised. Land with your foot 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) in front of your hip to apply force upon contact. More than this will cause braking, while too little reduces stability.\n\nAfter landing, drive your heel toward your buttocks as the opposite leg moves forward, repeating the previous motions. Alternate these steps to achieve a stride. Maximize energy from your legs, arms, and core to reach sprinting speed. Avoid heel striking or overstriding, as these can lead to inefficiency and injuries. Keep your wrists straight; your hand should reach nose height at the stride's peak and pass your buttocks when driving backward. Extend your fingers to enhance arm leverage and avoid clenching fists, which can disrupt your swing. Arm movements should originate from the shoulder joints, with relaxed shoulders and smooth swings. The power and frequency of your arm movements directly affect your stride speed. Balance your arms and legs; when a lead leg moves forward, the same side arm moves backward. Keep arms close when swinging forward and open them when swinging backward. Avoid flailing, which disrupts balance and wastes energy.\n\nSprinting mechanics are intricate and may initially feel unnatural. Take time to learn the form as a beginner to increase speed and prevent injuries. Use your warm-up to practice proper form slowly. If possible, work with a trainer to learn correct techniques; even a few sessions can greatly aid in mastering the movements. Record your sprints and review them post-workout to analyze and improve your form."}}

People most often keep their homes in the low- to mid-seventies for comfort. Try lowering the temperature a few degrees at a time until you can tolerate living in a cooler space. Enduring a cold house is a great way to save on utility costs during the winter. Check with your family first. Do the same with roommates if you don\u2019t live alone. The next time you feel chilly and reach for a cozy throw blanket or house shoes, resist the temptation. Instead, endure the cold and distract yourself if needed. The idea is to break the habit of always bundling up in warm layers when it's cold. Instead, learn to cope with the cold on your own. If you're accustomed to cooler temperatures and regularly take cold showers, this step should be easy. If you struggle to resist that comforter or quilt, fold it and store it on the top shelf of a closet. You'll be less inclined to reach for it if it's put away and inconvenient to access. Your body temperature naturally drops slightly when you sleep. If you want a crash course in developing willpower, train yourself to sleep without a blanket. Make ice water your preferred drink, even in the dead of winter. Drinking an icy beverage slightly lowers your internal temperature. This forces your body to adapt to the change. While most people turn to coffee or hot chocolate to warm up in colder months, try doing the opposite. Eventually, you won't feel the need to warm up. Besides being useful for building cold tolerance, ice water is usually free and widely available. Desensitizing yourself to the cold doesn't have to be all about stern discipline. Try an outdoor winter sport like sledding, skiing, or snowboarding for fun while others stay indoors. You'll adapt to the cold faster and have an enjoyable way to get through the cold months, rather than staying cooped up. Take a camping trip in late fall or winter to directly confront the cold. In the wild, you'll have no choice but to sleep on the cold ground. Your body will thank you! Chances are, after a few hours of intense skiing or snowboarding, you'll start to feel overheated.

For example, one purpose of conducting a conversation is to discuss scenarios grounded in commonsense. However, our interaction with LLMs has shown that these models emphasize the typical flow of events and struggle with questions involving negated verbs, such as \"not\" or \"cannot,\" like when asked, \"What cannot fly? For instance, LLMs might incorrectly answer that a penguin cannot fly.\" An example of this struggle is depicted in Figure 1, which illustrates a scenario where LLMs have difficulty with negated questions, showing that they often default to typical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on demonstrating the issue of LLMs struggling with negated questions and suggest an approach to improve their performance in this area. To clarify the problem statement, we start with an example and then use set theory to formalize it, highlighting its relevance in defining possible and impossible scenarios by establishing a clear framework for categorizing responses. Consider the scenario in Figure 1, where the standard question is, \"Who can PersonX be?\" In this context, the typical response expected is \"Santa Claus.\" The answer to the negated complementary question, \"Who cannot PersonX be?\" should include all valid responses that differ from the answer to the standard question, emphasizing that \"PersonX\" cannot be anyone other than \"Santa Claus.\" A valid answer is one that appropriately fits the scenario described, aligning with the conditions set by the question. In Figure 2, a Venn diagram illustrates answer sets: U is the universal set of answers; V is the set of all valid answers, which includes two subsets\u2014correct answers to a standard question (A) and correct answers to its negated complementary version (NC). Since the question pertains to a person, a non-person cannot be considered a valid answer, as it does not meet the criteria defined by the scenario. To illustrate the concept of a negated complementary question, we refer to the basic notion of the complement of a set, which includes all elements not in the original set, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, we define a set of correct answers to a negated complementary question using Equation 1, which clarifies the relationship between the sets by showing how they intersect and differ. NC = V \u2229 A\u2032 = {x | x \u2208 V \u2227 x /\u2209 A} (1), where NC represents answers to the negated complementary question, V is the set of all valid answers, A is the set of correct answers to the standard question, and A\u2032 is the complement of A within the universal set of all answers (U). We focus on commonsense questions because the uncertainty of results depends on the context and experiences of respondents, which influence their understanding and interpretation of scenarios. As defined by LeCun (2022), commonsense is a collection of world models representing what is likely, plausible, or impossible, highlighting its relevance in understanding LLMs' capabilities. In light of this, our goal is to assess the ability of LLMs to answer plausible questions that could be refuted or accepted within specific contexts, thereby evaluating their commonsense reasoning. Given their pre-training nature, we hypothesize that LLMs have an inherent bias towards likely scenarios, as these are the most frequently encountered in common text, leading them to favor probable outcomes over improbable ones. Most available text on the web supports answers to 'positive' questions, such as how to do things or where to go, rather than questions like how things cannot be done or where not to go, leading to a lack of data on negated scenarios. This creates an imbalance in training datasets due to the scarcity of plausible or impossible scenarios, leading to biased outcomes where LLMs struggle to accurately predict less common responses. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle to answer negated complementary questions, resulting in responses that represent plausible, but not impossible, answers, indicating a limitation in their understanding of negation. Although LLMs exhibit this shortcoming, we claim that providing sufficient instructions and examples, especially those demonstrating reasoning processes, can guide LLMs towards correctly answering negated complementary questions within a commonsense context. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We present an analysis that highlights the shortcomings of LLMs in addressing negated complementary questions in commonsensical scenarios, showing where they often fail to provide accurate answers. (2) We propose a novel methodology to enhance the performance of the GPT-3 model on negated complementary questions, comparing the results with those obtained using conventional methods to show improvements.

The standard question, \"Who can PersonX be?\" is answered with \"Santa Claus.\" Conversely, the negated question, \"Who cannot PersonX be?\" should yield all valid alternatives except the standard answer. In this case, non-person entities are not valid responses. Figure 2 illustrates this with a Venn diagram: U is the universal set of answers, V includes all valid answers, A represents correct answers to the standard question, and NC denotes answers to the negated version. We formalize this using set theory: NC = V \u2229 A\u2032 = {x | x \u2208 V \u2227 x /\u2208 A}, where NC is the set of negated answers, V is valid answers, A is correct answers to the standard question, and A\u2032 is the complement of A within U.

If you are using the whole avocado instead of just half, double the add-ins. For example, for a whole avocado worth of paste, you will need 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of plain yogurt. Using your hands, scoop up a dollop of the avocado paste and massage it into a section of your hair for about 1 minute. Repeat this process until all of your hair is covered and you have used all of the paste. If you have very thick or long hair, you may need to make a bit more paste at this point to cover all your hair. It might be a good idea to wear clothes that you don\u2019t mind staining, or you can wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. This will give your hair ample time to absorb the nutrients from the avocado paste. You can leave your hair uncovered, or protect your clothes and surroundings by putting on a shower cap or lightly wrapping your hair in a towel. After you have let the avocado paste sit in your hair for 15 minutes, wash it out thoroughly with water. Once the mixture is rinsed out, dry and style your hair as usual. Your hair should feel extra soft and smooth. Avocado paste alone should not make your hair greasy or weighed down, so you shouldn\u2019t need to use shampoo to get it all out. If you use olive oil or an egg as add-ins, however, you may need to use your regular shampoo to get all of the treatment out. For best results, condition your hair with an avocado paste once every 2 weeks. This will keep your hair moisturized and shiny without weighing it down. Feel free to experiment with different add-ins every 2 weeks until you find what works best for your hair. Remember to store any leftover avocado paste in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 41.40011978149414, "some": 0.863442579905192, "bart": -2.040757656097412, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 49 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 19 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "To prepare an avocado hair mask, begin by selecting a ripe avocado. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the avocado in half. Once halved, gently remove the pit with the knife or a spoon. In a clean bowl, mash half of the avocado with a fork. Continue mashing until there are no chunks left. Alternatively, you can use a blender or food processor for a smoother texture. Blending should only take a few seconds. The key to a successful hair mask is using a ripe avocado. A ripe avocado ensures that it can be easily broken down into a smooth paste. If your hair is particularly thick or long, consider using the whole avocado. However, if you only need half, store the remaining half for later use. To enhance the mask's nutrient content, consider adding extra ingredients. You might add one egg, which is rich in vitamins A and E. Another option is to mix in one tablespoon (15 mL) of plain yogurt. Olive oil, known for its conditioning properties, is also a great addition. Just one tablespoon (15 mL) can help prevent hair breakage. You might also include a few drops of essential oil, like peppermint or lavender. These oils can add a pleasant scent and additional nutrients. You can mix all of these ingredients at once or choose the ones that suit your hair type and desired effects. Stir the mixture with a fork, or blend it in a food processor until everything is well combined. Each additive serves a unique purpose. For instance, yogurt can strengthen your hair and add shine. Eggs support healthy hair growth due to their biotin content. Essential oils can mask any unpleasant avocado smell. Even without add-ins, avocado is beneficial. It is rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and vitamins. Thus, you can opt for a pure avocado mask if desired. If using a whole avocado, adjust the quantities of the add-ins accordingly. For instance, double the yogurt to two tablespoons (30 mL). After preparation, scoop a dollop of the avocado paste with your hands. Massage it into a section of your hair for about one minute. Continue until your entire head is covered in the paste. If your hair is exceptionally thick or long, you might need to prepare more paste. During application, wear clothes that can get stained, or drape a towel over your shoulders. This protects your clothing from the mask. Allow the avocado paste to sit in your hair for 15 minutes. This time lets your hair absorb all the nutrients. You can leave your hair uncovered. Alternatively, protect your surroundings by wearing a shower cap or wrapping your hair in a towel. Once the 15 minutes have passed, thoroughly rinse the paste from your hair with water. After rinsing, dry and style your hair as usual. You will notice your hair feels extra soft and smooth. Avocado paste alone should not leave your hair greasy. Therefore, shampoo might not be necessary. However, if you added olive oil or an egg, you might need to shampoo to remove all residues. For optimal results, consider conditioning your hair with the avocado mask every two weeks. This routine will keep your hair moisturized and shiny without heaviness. Feel free to experiment with different add-ins every two weeks. This way, you can find the combination that works best for your hair type."}}

Inhaling steam can moisturize and soothe irritated airways, reducing inflammation and helping to clear mucus. To produce enough steam, go into the bathroom and turn on the hot shower, closing the door to keep the steam inside. The hot water creates a warm, humid environment, which is ideal for loosening nasal congestion. Remain in the bathroom with the hot water running for three to five minutes; this duration allows the steam to effectively penetrate and hydrate your sinuses. After this time, the nasal secretions should be loose and ready to be blown out of your nose, indicating that the treatment is working. You can also hold your head over a large bowl of freshly boiled water and cover your head with a towel to trap the steam. Make sure the water is freshly boiled to produce ample steam, and exercise caution to avoid burns. Breathe in the steam for about 10 minutes, or until you feel your nasal congestion improve, as it helps thin mucus and relieve pressure. If you feel dizziness during either method, step into fresh air, have a seat, and breathe normally. This will pass; there is nothing to be alarmed about, and it will resolve in a few minutes. You can use essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint in the bathroom, as they are natural decongestants and may be beneficial. Eucalyptus oil has been shown to have decongestant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, which should help to clear your sinuses and aid in the prevention of a sinus infection. These properties work by reducing swelling and combating bacteria, potentially preventing further complications. To use, add five to 10 drops of the oil to the tub or bowl of water. Keep essential oils away from children, as they can be hazardous if not handled properly. Sometimes, dry sinuses can contribute to congestion. This can be caused by environmental factors like low humidity or excessive heating indoors. Humidifiers can help by adding moisture to the air, similar to steam. Use it while you're at home or sleeping to keep your nose moist and loosen secretions. You can add around five drops of essential oils such as eucalyptus or peppermint to your humidifier water to help with congestion. Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial, decongestant, and anti-inflammatory properties that can help clear nasal passages and reduce discomfort. Heat can also help your nasal congestion and drain your sinuses. To apply heat, take a moist washcloth and place it in the microwave for two to three minutes. The temperature should be hot but tolerable; you can test it on the inside of your wrist to ensure it's safe. Place the cloth across your nose and let it sit until the heat dissipates, allowing the warmth to loosen mucus. Repeat the process as needed, keeping track of when your congestion returns. Use care not to burn yourself when removing the washcloth from the microwave. A saline spray is beneficial for loosening nasal congestion by moisturizing the nasal passages. To make your own, mix 8 oz of warm water with one-half teaspoon of salt in a bowl. To use, fill the pot with warm water at about 120 degrees, ensuring the temperature is comfortable. The water will drain out of the nostril, and any discomfort should quickly subside. Make sure the water is clean and sterile to avoid introducing impurities. Boil the water beforehand to warm it and remove impurities if you are unsure about the safety of your water supply. Certain drinks and foods can alleviate sinus issues, like hot tea, which has a similar effect to steam. The heat from the tea will warm your sinus passages and help them drain, providing relief. Even though you may not feel like exercising when you have sinus congestion, physical activity can help increase mucus flow and clear nasal secretions. Try aerobic exercise for 15 to 20 minutes, choosing manageable activities. Aerobic exercise can help break up secretions and increase blood flow, soothing nasal congestion."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 21.832719802856445, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.064049005508423, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 39 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 31 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Steam is considered one of the most effective methods for encouraging sinus drainage, providing relief from nasal congestion. To create a sufficient amount of steam, one can simply turn on the hot water in the shower and close the bathroom door to trap the steam inside. It is advisable to stay in the bathroom for about three to five minutes, allowing the steam to loosen the nasal secretions, making them easier to expel. Alternatively, placing your head over a large bowl of freshly boiled water, and draping a towel over your head to capture the steam, can also be beneficial. Inhaling the steam for approximately 10 minutes or until you notice an improvement in your nasal congestion can be quite effective. \n\nIf you experience any dizziness while using these steaming methods, it's important to step into a space with fresh air, take a seat, and breathe normally until the sensation passes. This is generally not a cause for concern and should resolve on its own within a few minutes. For those who enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy, adding essential oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, or peppermint to the steam can enhance the experience. These oils are known for their natural decongestant properties and may further aid in clearing the sinuses.\n\nEucalyptus oil, in particular, has been recognized for its decongestant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. By incorporating five to 10 drops of eucalyptus oil into your steam setup, you may find it easier to clear your sinuses and potentially prevent a sinus infection. It is crucial to keep essential oils out of reach of children, as they can be harmful or even fatal if ingested or used improperly.\n\nIn some cases, sinus congestion may be aggravated by dryness. To address this, humidifiers can be employed to increase the moisture level in the air, thus helping to loosen nasal secretions. Running a humidifier while you are at home or sleeping can be particularly beneficial. Adding a few drops of essential oils, such as eucalyptus or peppermint, to the humidifier water can further assist in alleviating congestion.\n\nHeat therapy is another effective approach for dealing with nasal congestion. A simple method involves using a moist washcloth heated in the microwave for two to three minutes. The washcloth should be hot but still tolerable to the touch. Placing it across your nose until the heat dissipates can help loosen secretions, making it easier to clear your nasal passages. Exercise caution when removing the washcloth from the microwave, as microwaves vary in power and the cloth may become too hot.\n\nSaline spray is another tool that can aid in loosening nasal congestion. You can create your own saline solution by mixing 8 ounces of warm water with half a teaspoon of salt in a bowl. A bulb suction device, available at most stores, can be used to administer the solution. By placing the long end of the bulb in the solution, squeezing it to release air, and then allowing it to fill with the saline solution, you can administer two sprays into each nostril. This process can help to add moisture to your nasal secretions, facilitating easier expulsion. Commercial saline nasal sprays and drops are also available at pharmacies and can be used every few hours, as they contain no medication. Saline drops are safe and effective for people of all ages, including babies.\n\nAnother method for cleansing your sinus passages is using a neti pot. This miniature teapot-shaped device can flush warm water through one nostril and out the other, effectively clearing debris and mucus. To use a neti pot, fill it with warm water at around 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Tilt your head to the left and slightly backward, positioning the spout at your right nostril. As you raise the pot, the water will flow into your right nostril and drain out of the left. It is essential to ensure the water is clean and sterile; boiling it beforehand can help remove impurities if you are uncertain about your water supply's safety.\n\nCertain foods and drinks can also aid in alleviating sinus issues. Hot beverages, such as tea, can have a similar effect to steam. The heat from the tea warms the sinus passages, encouraging drainage. While any type of tea can be beneficial, peppermint and lavender varieties may offer additional advantages due to their potential decongestant properties. Including spicy foods in your diet, such as hot salsa, spicy peppers, or hot wings, can also help heat up your sinuses, promoting the flow of secretions. Similarly, consuming hot soup or broth can assist in loosening the sinuses.\n\nAlthough exercising might be the last thing on your mind when dealing with sinus congestion, physical activity can increase the flow of mucus in your sinuses and aid in clearing nasal passages. Engaging in aerobic exercise for 15 to 20 minutes can be particularly helpful. For those with allergies to pollen or other environmental substances, exercising indoors at a gym or at home can minimize exposure to allergens.\n\nManual techniques can also be employed to help drain your sinuses. By applying gentle pressure with your index and middle fingers in a circular motion over areas such as the forehead, bridge of the nose, beside the eyes, and under the eyes, you can manually encourage the movement of secretions. Using an oil like rosemary along your forehead can further assist in opening up sinus passages. This manual manipulation not only helps to break up secretions but also warms the area through the action of your hands."}}

There are far too many inexperienced backyard breeders who carelessly attempt to breed dogs without a comprehensive understanding of this unique breed, posing severe risks. Motivated by potential profits, these backyard breeders eagerly enter the market, driven by greed, which unfortunately leads to significant suffering for the bulldog. Many bulldogs experience severe breathing difficulties due to a combination of flat faces, large tongues, and narrow windpipes. If either bulldog in the mating pair has undergone surgery to widen its nostrils, reduce parts of its soft palate, or remove its tonsils, it should not be bred due to the risk of passing on these health issues. Breeding bulldogs with breathing difficulties should be avoided to prevent inheriting these distressing problems. Do not breed the female during the summer months if she has breathing troubles, as the heat can significantly worsen her condition. Studies show that a mother's character can be inherited by her puppies, highlighting the importance of selecting a calm and friendly female for breeding. Selecting a calm and friendly female for breeding is crucial as it results in well-behaved puppies. Breeding from a calm, friendly, and gentle dog offers extensive benefits. A calmer female will be a better mother, less prone to being snappy or insecure with her puppies. Ensuring that she has healthy skin and is free from skin parasites is paramount. One full month before breeding your English bulldogs, your veterinarian should conduct a thorough physical examination of the female. Make sure she is up-to-date on all vaccinations, free from worms, and does not test positive for brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can cause spontaneous abortion.

The genetic predisposition for a crowded throat will be passed on to the pups, perpetuating these distressing problems. Even if your bulldogs haven\u2019t required surgery, you should still avoid breeding them if they struggle to breathe. Avoid breeding the female during the summer months if she has breathing troubles, as the hot weather can exacerbate the issue during pregnancy and cause undue distress. Evidence suggests that the mother's temperament is passed on to her puppies. If she is excessively nervous or aggressive, her puppies are likely to exhibit similar undesirable behaviors. The ideal bitch to breed from is a calm, friendly, and gentle dog. A calmer female will also make a better mother, reducing the likelihood of being snappy or insecure with her puppies. It is crucial to ensure she has healthy skin and is free from skin parasites. Mange caused by the demodex mite can worsen with the stress of pregnancy, leading to hair loss and rhino-like skin. Additionally, the demodex mite can be transferred to the pups at birth, resulting in poor coats and skin.

It was a clothing manufacturing company. After a few weeks of training and getting a grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given heavier and more challenging tasks. Instead of tagging price tags on shirts and t-shirts, I now had to tag price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school bags, etc. I also had to pack these items in boxes, considering their price, weight, and size. Once packed, I used a tap gun to seal the boxes and then placed them on pallets, moving them with a roller to a location where other employees would load them onto trucks for delivery to stores. Despite being the youngest employee, my colleagues were very friendly and always ready to help me when I needed it. After three months, I was promoted to a higher position, and my salary increased due to my hard work and focus. Life was starting to feel better, and I moved out of my parents' house to rent my own apartment. Although paying my bills wasn't easy, I took on part-time jobs to manage. I also needed to save money to take additional courses and further grow my career."}}

Create a detailed budget including all income and expenses to determine available funds for debt payments. Consider reducing expenses by saving and cutting non-essentials, and explore ways to increase income. Establish a realistic monthly amount to allocate for debt repayment. Prioritize debts and assess how much you can pay. Contact creditors to discuss restructuring and reorganizing debt payments. Provide detailed payment information to renegotiate loan terms. You might arrange a new repayment plan with lower monthly payments over an extended period. Focus on reaching agreements with the most challenging creditors first. Easier creditors can be addressed later after reducing major payments. If overwhelmed or unable to negotiate, consult a non-profit credit counseling organization. Several charities offer free, impartial advice for financial difficulties. Seek in-person meetings for tailored advice. Many universities, military bases, and U.S. Cooperative Extension services offer non-profit credit counseling. Local credit unions and housing authorities may also help. Choose reputable organizations with strong records. Non-profit doesn't always mean free. A credit counselor might suggest a debt management plan if you can't repay debts. This involves paying the counseling organization, which then pays your unsecured debts. Discuss this option with creditors and only proceed after thorough financial review. Counselors typically offer budgeting advice without pushing for such plans. Debt settlement involves working with a company to pay creditors lump sums less than owed. Creditors agree if it's preferable to future payment pursuits. The company makes payments, but you'll deposit money into a savings account long-term. This approach is risky, so ensure you can sustain monthly payments indefinitely. Creditors aren't obliged to settle with debt companies. Settlement companies prioritize payments to themselves, impacting your credit score negatively. Unpaid debts may incur extra fees. Be cautious of debt settlement scams and verify company promises. Research thoroughly and seek free advice from non-profit credit counselors before committing. Debt consolidation might lower costs by securing a new line of credit, like re-mortgaging your home. Such plans use your home as collateral, so evaluate risks carefully. Avoid consolidation schemes with variable rates that may become costlier over time. If debts are unmanageable, consider filing for bankruptcy as a last resort. Bankruptcy has long-lasting consequences, making future credit or home purchases difficult. Options include Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, with Chapter 7 being quicker but not always available. Bankruptcy may offer a fresh start but should be carefully considered. Discuss with a credit counselor and a bankruptcy attorney before deciding."}}

A 4-inch (10.2 cm) space without slits is present at the bottom of the 8-inch (20.3 cm) PVC pipe. This gap of four inches will connect directly to the PVC pipe, forming a secure attachment. Mark three slits circumferentially around the 8-inch (20.3 cm) pipe to allow water to pass through effectively. Each slit should measure approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) in length and be evenly spaced around the pipe's circumference. The distance between each slit should be about 1.4 inches (3.5 cm) to maintain structural integrity. Ensure that no slit connects all the way around the pipe to prevent structural weakness. Leave a small gap between the ends of each slit to maintain the pipe's durability. Draw three additional slits two inches above the initial set of slits, maintaining a consistent spacing pattern.

Continue creating sets of three slits, each spaced two inches apart, until the screen reaches a total length of 6 feet (1.8 m). This length will allow a substantial amount of water to pass through the pipe and be effectively filtered. Use a hacksaw to cut out the slits according to the lines you have drawn, taking care not to cut entirely through the pipe. Carefully saw each line, ensuring precision to maintain the integrity of the screen. Continue sawing until you have created a slit for every line marked on the pipe. You will need to find a PVC cap to seal the end of the well screen securely. Ensure that the cap fits snugly onto the well screen to prevent any leakage, which could compromise the filtration system. Apply primer liberally to ensure a strong bond and prevent any leaks from occurring. Once you have applied the primer to the end cap, turn your attention to the well screen. Apply an equal amount of primer around the mating portion of the well screen to ensure a secure bond. The double layer of primer will help both pieces hold together effectively.

Allow the pipe to rest for several minutes to ensure that the glue has dried completely, providing a robust seal. The foot valve is a mechanism that permits water to be drawn in but prevents it from escaping back out. Two-foot valves are used in this well system to ensure efficient water movement. The first foot valve is located at the bottom of the six-inch PVC pipe, while the second one is situated at the bottom of the 4-inch (10.2 cm) PVC pipe. These mechanisms enable water to be drawn into the 6-inch (15.2 cm) pipe during the upstroke of the well.

It can be entertaining simply to throw as much money as possible at the screen. Shoot in an exotic locale. Plan enormous choreographed dance sequences. Hire supermodels. Great music videos can be pure spectacle, plain and simple. Hype Williams' video for Jay Z's 'Big Pimpin'' exemplifies the music video as a spectacle. There's very little in the way of narrative or story - it's mostly just Jay Z and friends having a good time on a massive yacht, partying at a tropical villa, and throwing money to a crowd, all while surrounded by beautiful women. As a display of wealth and braggadocio, it's very effective, capturing the essence of excess and high living that the song embodies. Lady Gaga is another artist famous for her elaborate music videos. Steven Klein's video for her 'Alejandro' depicts a bizarre, sexually-charged militaristic dystopia, complete with insane (but appropriate) sets and costumes. It's a striking, extravagant production, showcasing Gaga's flair for theatricality and boundary-pushing visuals that complement her music's complex themes. Her videos often challenge viewers, compelling them to engage with her artistic vision that merges music with avant-garde fashion and provocative storytelling. Conversely, many great music videos follow a 'less is more' philosophy. Minimalist music videos allow the viewer to focus on the action (and its emotional relationship with the music) with no other distractions. A minimal video is also a great choice for directors on a limited budget. Notable examples include Sinead O'Connor's 'Nothing Compares 2 U' and Radiohead's 'No Surprises,' where simplicity enhances the emotional impact. Sinead O'Connor's video is famous for its close-up shots that convey raw emotion, while Radiohead's 'No Surprises' uses a single continuous shot to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability. Saam's video for The XX's 'Islands' uses repetitive shots of a short, tightly-choreographed dance to great effect. By making very subtle changes to the dancer's moves each time the shot repeats, we're able to see hints of a tragic romance unfolding. The gradual change makes the final shot all the more shocking. OK GO's early videos used imaginative choreography to create instantly memorable viewing experiences on a minuscule budget. Their video for 'Here it goes again' (directed by Trish Sie and the band) is a great example of a well-done video shot for almost nothing. The video is filmed in one static take in an undecorated room, with the only props being eight treadmills. Because of the strength of the choreography and the memorability of the concept, the video was a big viral hit when it was released in 2006."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 35.61884307861328, "some": 0.8992138703664144, "bart": -1.4492835998535156, "cons_acc": 0.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe sentence 'As a display of wealth and braggadocio, it's very effective' has been changed, please do not modify this sentence."}, "polished_text": "Music video creation, like any art form, has its \"classics\"\u2014videos that have significantly influenced future artists and directors. Many of the greatest music videos are iconic for various reasons: some are visually inventive, others have a sharp focus, and some perfectly complement the music. Understanding what makes certain music videos particularly influential can provide valuable insights for creating your own unforgettable video. Many beloved music videos tell stories that are funny, shocking, tragic, or triumphant. A truly compelling story lingers in the viewer's mind for weeks, months, or even years. Arguably one of the most famous videos of all time, John Landis' video for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" tells a classic story and greatly exceeds the length of the actual song. While it works here, caution is advised\u2014too little music and too much video can result in a dull combination. The video for Radiohead's \"Just,\" directed by Jamie Thraves, also tells a great story with a drastically different tone. It uses an excellently-cast ensemble and an open-to-interpretation ending to critique the monotony of white-collar life, matching Thom Yorke's spiteful lyrics. \n\nMusic videos are excellent platforms for showcasing visual innovation and trickery. They offer opportunities to incorporate abstract visuals, unique effects, or animation that complement the song's audio. The visuals need not \"make sense\" in a traditional way; as long as they are striking and harmonize with the song, they can leave a lasting impression. Steve Barron's video for A-ha's \"Take on Me\" features a romantic story told through a blend of live action and sketchbook-style rotoscope animation. This stylistic choice perfectly matches the song's whimsical, smitten tone and creates an unforgettable visual style. The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army,\" directed by Alex and Martin, uses visual trickery to create the illusion of a continuously-zooming shot, resulting in a disorienting effect that enhances the video's dark atmosphere. See also: Muse's \"Stockholm Syndrome,\" Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing.\"\n\nCultural references are frequently used in music videos, serving as either loving homages or scathing parodies of the referenced material. With a good sense of humor, the results can be classic. If artists are willing to engage in self-deprecation, all the better\u2014audiences appreciate musicians humble enough to poke fun at themselves. Hype Williams' video for 2Pac and Dr. Dre's \"California Love\" parodies the Mad Max films, humorously portraying early 1990s California as a lawless, survival-of-the-fittest playground akin to the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Mad Max. An even funnier parody is the Beastie Boys' \"Sabotage,\" directed by Spike Jonze, where the band caricatures gritty 1970s TV cops, resulting in a memorable and hilarious video that perfectly suits the music.\n\nSometimes, music videos are purely about spectacle. Shooting in exotic locales, planning enormous choreographed dance sequences, and hiring supermodels can create visually stunning experiences. Hype Williams' video for Jay Z's \"Big Pimpin'\" exemplifies music video as spectacle, with scenes of lavish parties on a yacht and tropical villa, effectively conveying wealth and braggadocio.

Selling furniture locally allows you to avoid traveling long distances, saving time and money. The ad will primarily be viewed by local community members who are interested in purchasing furniture, home decor, or other household items.

Chairish is a specialized site for high-end furniture listings, while platforms like OfferUp, Bonanza, Facebook Marketplace, ArtDeco, 1dibs, and Oodle are also worth exploring. These sites allow you to create advertisements and upload photos, making them accessible to a broad audience. However, shipping costs can pose challenges when selling beyond your local area. It's essential to clarify who will cover these costs and ensure the buyer is willing to handle them. Many listing platforms require a small advertising fee, which could be as low as $1. Additionally, some sites may charge a commission, typically a percentage of the final sale price. Apps like LetGo, Chairish, Apartment Therapy Bazar, 5Miles, and Everything But The House offer user-friendly interfaces and often waive initial listing fees. However, it's important to read the fine print, as some apps may charge a commission of up to 25% of the final sale price. Consignment shops specializing in high-end and vintage furniture can be a viable option. You will need to transport your furniture to the shop, where it will be displayed for sale. This approach allows you to showcase your furniture locally with minimal effort. Consignment shops usually take a commission upon sale, which can range from 25% to over 50%, so discussing terms beforehand is crucial. Some shops may require you to discount or reclaim items that don't sell within a specified period. Although consignment shops are often small, this can make your furniture more noticeable. However, they may not attract many customers interested in high-priced items. If you prefer selling independently, consider placing a classified ad in your local newspaper. A classified ad allows you to include a brief description and possibly a photo of your furniture. Be sure to provide contact information, such as your phone number or email address, for potential buyers. A clear ad can facilitate a sale with a local buyer, eliminating the need for extensive travel. However, newspapers have limited reach, as not everyone reads them. Only community members are likely to see your ad, and they may not be interested. Discuss the cost of running a classified ad with the newspaper, as it can be pricey. Newspapers often charge a fixed fee per line, ranging from $5 to $100. Many newspapers also post classified ads on their websites, though a separate fee may apply. Research local stores and traveling dealers online, sending them descriptions and photos of your furniture. If a dealer is interested, they might purchase your furniture directly, often handling shipping themselves. Dealers are usually trustworthy and reliable, but they are resellers, so you might not get the best price. The success of a sale depends on the dealer\u2019s interest and the quality of your furniture. If a dealer isn\u2019t interested, they might offer a free estimate of your furniture's value. For items too valuable to sell through traditional means, such as family heirlooms, consider consulting a professional. Auction houses or shops with a history of selling antiques can provide valuable assistance. These establishments often have evaluators who can help determine a fair sales price. They may buy the furniture from you or connect you with potential buyers. To gain insights into selling antiques, reach out to antique associations and search for national organizations online. While antiques can be sold online, accurately pricing and advertising them can be challenging. You may require a professional opinion to determine the provenance of your furniture, for instance."}}

Within various applications, an unresolved query pertains to the extent of LLMs\u2019 capability to comprehensively grasp human mental health conditions expressed in natural language and provide accurate diagnoses. Mental ill-health issues pose a substantial and far-reaching challenge to individuals and communities on a global scale, impacting their overall well-being and quality of life. Recent data indicates that over 20% of adults are likely to encounter at least one mental disorder during their lifetime, with a significant 5.6% experiencing severe psychotic disorders that severely impact their daily functioning and overall quality of life. Moreover, depression and anxiety alone contribute to a staggering annual global economic productivity loss of approximately $1 trillion, resulting in significant economic burdens on individuals and societies. Over the last ten years, there has been a significant abundance of research in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science aimed at comprehensively identifying mental ill-health issues using online text data, such as social media content and various other digital platforms. However, a majority of these investigations have concentrated on constructing highly specialised machine learning (ML) models for specific tasks like stress detection, depression prediction, and other related applications. Even conventional pre-trained language models like BERT often necessitate fine-tuning for particular downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and other complex applications.

Anxiety disorders are marked by an excessive sense of fear and worry, accompanied by related behavioral disturbances, such as avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, which can significantly impact an individual\u2019s quality of life. These symptoms are severe enough to cause significant distress or impair daily functioning, resulting in substantial emotional and psychological burden on the individual and their loved ones. There are various types of anxiety disorders, including generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worrying and rumination), panic disorder (defined by recurrent panic attacks and fear of anxiety), social anxiety disorder (involving excessive fear and apprehension in social situations and fear of social evaluation), separation anxiety disorder (involving intense fear or anxiety regarding separation from emotionally significant individuals), and other related disorders. Effective psychological interventions are available, and in certain cases, depending on factors like age, severity of the condition, and individual needs, medication may also be considered as a potential treatment option, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. Depression stands apart from the usual shifts in mood and brief emotional reactions to daily challenges, resulting in persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. During a depressive episode, an individual consistently experiences a persistent low mood (such as feeling sad, irritable, or empty) or a diminished capacity to experience pleasure or interest in activities, enduring for the majority of the day, virtually every day, for a minimum of two weeks, resulting in significant impairment in daily functioning and quality of life. Additionally, several other symptoms manifest, which may encompass difficulties in concentration, overwhelming feelings of guilt or diminished self-esteem, a sense of hopelessness about the future, contemplations of death or suicide, disrupted sleep patterns, alterations in appetite or body weight, and heightened fatigue or reduced energy levels, resulting in significant emotional and physical distress. It\u2019s crucial to note that individuals with depression face an elevated risk of suicidal thoughts and actions, highlighting the need for prompt and effective treatment and support.

I reconnected with high school friends and we pregamed before attending. The festival had live music and vendors from across the state. My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, featured on different days. A friend got me onto the judging panel for dishes, which was incredible. I had so much fun and collected recipes to take home. I also met a local chef with a Food Network show, which was thrilling for a cooking enthusiast like me. We spent lots of time in nature, swimming in our favorite childhood lake with Sasha. We even went on a mini camping trip, hiking deeper into nature and pitching tents. This was definitely one of my favorite visits here! I reconnected with myself, letting nature and friends lift my spirits."}}

Wash and condition your hair as usual, then towel it dry to remove excess moisture, ensuring it's damp but not dripping, in preparation for the haircut. Layering short hair yourself is more challenging than layering long hair because each layer requires careful attention to detail and precision. Keep in mind that this method will only work for pixie style cuts because the short length and specific shape of a pixie cut require precise layering for the desired look. Take a look at your hair and decide exactly where you want the layers to be and how short you want them before you begin, visualizing the final style to guide your cutting process. Plan to cut your hair in a well-lit bathroom with at least two mirrors so you can frequently check your progress and see the back of your head for accuracy and consistency. Divide short hair into sections before layering to make it easier to manage and ensure even layering. Use a comb to carefully divide your hair by creating a \"top box\" section with a part on either side of the crown of the head where it begins to round. The two parts create a section of hair in the middle of your head, which is essential for achieving even layers and ensuring the cut is balanced. Comb this \"top box\" forward and the hair on either side straight down to clearly delineate the sections and make them easier to manage. It may also help to twist your hair before clipping it, as twisting helps hold the hair in place, making it easier to cut evenly. To create clear boundaries for each section, divide the rest of the hair into two parts: the first extends from the crown of your head to your forehead, and the second from the crown to the nape of your neck. Lift the hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger to maintain even tension and achieve uniform layers. Your fingers should be perpendicular to your forehead to ensure a consistent angle and length throughout the cut. Use sharp scissors to trim the tips of the hair extending from between your fingers, as they provide a clean, precise cut. Let the hair fall, then use the comb to lift another section of hair immediately behind the front section to keep the cut flowing smoothly and consistently. Then comb a bit of hair from the first section into this new section to serve as a guide for the correct length, ensuring consistency across layers. Hold it at a 90-degree angle from your head between your forefinger and middle finger, then trim the tips to the exact same length as the first section of hair you trimmed, maintaining uniformity. Continue trimming hair from the top until you've trimmed the entire front and back sections of the box, ensuring completeness of the cut. Use a spray bottle filled with water to keep the hair damp as you go, as damp hair is easier to manage and cut smoothly. If your hair gets too wet, dry it with a towel to maintain the ideal dampness for cutting. Pay careful attention to which sections of hair have been cut and which still need to be trimmed to avoid repetition and ensure all hair is evenly trimmed. Avoid cutting the same section twice when working with short hair to prevent uneven lengths and an imbalanced cut. All hair should be trimmed to the same length to achieve a cohesive look and ensure the style is symmetrical. Once the cut is finished, it will have a layered appearance, with each layer blending seamlessly into the next for a polished look. Once the entire top box has been trimmed, change the part by combing your hair straight down the middle to make final adjustments. Start from the front of your hair, move around the side to the back, and lift sections straight from the top of your head, holding them between your fingers for even tension and control. Hold your hair so that your fingers are perpendicular to your forehead to ensure consistency in the angle and length of each cut. Use the scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section, maintaining the flow and order of the cut. Keep trimming the top layer of hair on one side of your head, then move to the other side to ensure symmetry and evenness. If you notice uneven spots or want shorter layers, carefully trim a small section at a time to make precise adjustments. At this point, you can also refine the edges by trimming any stray hairs and ensuring clean lines. Comb your hair into the style you plan to wear it in and trim the edges to finalize the look, ensuring the style is polished. Check around the ears and the back of the hairline especially, as these areas can be prone to unevenness and require careful attention for a clean finish."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 28.83977699279785, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -1.779771089553833, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nAll sentences in the polished text contains more than 7 words, it follows the user's requirement."}, "polished_text": "When cutting short hair, it's best to layer it while the hair is evenly damp. This ensures you can achieve greater precision while trimming. Begin by washing and conditioning your hair as you normally would, then towel-dry it to prepare for the haircut. Layering short hair is more challenging to do on your own compared to layering long hair, as each layer must be created individually. Remember, this method is specifically designed for pixie-style cuts. Before you start cutting, examine your hair carefully to determine where you want the layers and how short you want them to be. It's important to cut your hair in a well-lit bathroom equipped with at least two mirrors, allowing you to monitor your progress and see the back of your head. \n\nTo begin layering, divide your short hair into sections to ensure accuracy. Use a comb to neatly divide your hair in the following manner: Create a \"top box\" section by parting either side of the crown where the head begins to round. This results in a section of hair located in the middle of your head. Comb this \"top box\" forward and comb the hair on either side straight down, ensuring the sections are clearly defined. Twisting your hair before clipping it may also be helpful. Divide the remaining hair into two parts: one that extends from the crown to your forehead and another from the crown to the nape of your neck. Lift the hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger, ensuring your fingers are perpendicular to your forehead.\n\nUse a sharp pair of scissors to trim the tips of the hair extending from between your fingers.

If the hair becomes too wet, dry it off gently with a towel.\n\nPay close attention to sections of hair that have already been cut versus those still needing a trim. When working with short hair, cutting the same section twice can significantly affect the final result. Ensure all hair is trimmed to the same length for a layered appearance once the cut is finished. After trimming the entire top box, change your hair part by combing it to create a straight part down the middle. Work from the front of your hair around the side to the back, lifting sections of hair straight from the top of your head and holding them between your fingers. Keep your fingers perpendicular to your forehead as you use scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section. Repeat this process until you've trimmed the top layer on each side of your head. \n\nIf you notice any uneven spots or desire shorter layers, use scissors to carefully trim your hair a small section at a time. At this stage, you can also refine the edges of your haircut. Comb your hair into the style you intend to wear and trim the edges for a polished finish. Pay special attention to the areas around your ears and the back of your hairline to ensure a clean and even look."}}

However, researchers continue to explore multiple strategies to enhance PLMs. In specialized domains like biomedical, using domain-specific texts such as PubMed and MIMIC can improve downstream tasks significantly (Lee et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019). Unlike training with unlabeled text, many studies focus on incorporating structural knowledge, such as triplets and facts, to achieve better language understanding (Zhang et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019). In this work, we propose combining these strategies to create a Knowledge-enhanced Biomedical pretrained Language Model (KeBioLM). Biomedical and clinical fields, being data-rich disciplines, have accumulated vast knowledge over time (Ashburner et al., 2000; Stearns et al., 2001). A notable example is the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), containing over 4 million entities and 900 types of relations (Bodenreider, 2004). Figure 1 illustrates two entities, \"glycerin\" and \"inflammation,\" linked to UMLS with a \"may_prevent\" relation. Entities and relations in biomedical text provide crucial insights for better understanding (Xu et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020). We aim to enhance biomedical PLMs by explicitly modeling knowledge. We process PubMed text to link entities to the knowledge base using ScispaCy to annotate 660 million entities across 3.5 million documents (Neumann et al., 2019). We implement a knowledge-enhanced language model based on F\u00e9vry et al. (2020), featuring both text-only and text-entity fusion encoding. Text-only encoding bridges text and entities, while text-entity fusion combines token information with entity knowledge. We introduce entity extraction and linking objectives to improve entity representations further. The entity embeddings are initialized with TransE, incorporating both entity and relation data from the knowledge graph (Bordes et al., 2013). We test our model on named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) tasks using the BLURB benchmark dataset. Our KeBioLM outperforms previous models, achieving average scores of 87.1 on five NER datasets and 81.2 on three RE datasets. Additionally, KeBioLM excels in a probing task requiring model predictions of masked entities in UMLS triplets. Our contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose KeBioLM, a biomedical language model that integrates UMLS knowledge. \u2022 Experimental results show KeBioLM achieves superior performance on both NER and RE tasks. \u2022 We compile a cloze-style probing dataset from UMLS triplets, demonstrating that KeBioLM absorbs more knowledge than other biomedical PLMs."}}

A properly fitting pencil skirt can boost your confidence and ensure you feel comfortable throughout the day, as it seamlessly integrates into your overall appearance. While clothing manufacturers generally size skirts according to the same basic measurements, you should still try the skirt on before you buy it to ensure the waistband sits comfortably and the hemline falls at a flattering point. Trying on the skirt is essential because it allows you to assess how the waistband placement aligns with your body and whether the hemline accentuates your figure. If a pencil skirt is too large, it may add extra volume to your midsection, making your waist look wider and giving your figure a boxy appearance, which can make certain outfits look unflattering and less stylish. Wearing a skirt that's too loose can detract from your overall look, leading to a lack of definition in your silhouette and potentially diminishing your style. Conversely, if a pencil skirt is too small, it can create bulges along your thighs, stomach, and rear. Super tight skirts are also difficult to walk in because they restrict your movement and limit your stride, which can cause discomfort and make navigating daily activities a challenge. If you're unsure where to start, look for a pencil skirt with a waistband that sits about 2 inches (5 cm) above your navel, as this placement helps define your waist and creates a more balanced and proportional silhouette. This waistband position can enhance your waistline, offering a flattering fit that accentuates your natural curves. The material should fit around the widest part of your hips without looking stretched, and it should taper off and end below that point rather than directly on it, which helps create a more flattering silhouette by elongating your figure. By tapering below the hips, the skirt avoids drawing attention to the widest point, instead producing a streamlined appearance. The length of the lower hemline and the height of the waistband will have slightly different effects on your overall appearance, so try on various styles to see which one you prefer while standing in front of a mirror, as this can help you determine your personal preferences and find the most flattering look. Exploring different styles allows you to understand which designs complement your body best, helping you make informed choices that align with your taste. If you want to appear taller or leaner, opt for a high-waisted style with a shorter hemline to create the illusion of longer legs and a narrower waist, as high-waisted styles extend the line of your legs and enhance your overall proportions. This approach not only elongates your figure but also contributes to a more sophisticated and elegant appearance. Taller women may prefer pencil skirts that fall to the knee or just below, as the extra length can add sophistication while still showcasing their naturally long legs. This creates a more elongated silhouette that enhances their height, allowing them to maintain a graceful and poised look. Nowadays, pencil skirts come in a wide range of fabrics and prints; sticking with classic choices offers versatility, but bold options can add pizzazz to your outfit by creating a statement piece that draws attention. Bold skirts can serve as the focal point of your ensemble, injecting personality and flair into your wardrobe. A black pencil skirt is an easy-to-style staple that transitions seamlessly from professional to casual to seductive, as it pairs effortlessly with a variety of tops and shoes, unlike vibrant colors and prints, which can be harder to dress up. Its versatility makes it a wardrobe essential, offering endless styling possibilities. Keep in mind that color, pattern, and texture can affect your overall appearance\u2014the more you deviate from standard black, the more attention you'll draw to your lower half, potentially creating a statement piece that stands out. The choice of color and texture can transform your look, adding depth and interest to your outfit. Pencil skirts suit most body types, but if you're particularly curvy on the bottom, be mindful of how you wear them, as they emphasize lower curves and may not be suitable for all occasions, especially those requiring a more understated look. In certain settings, a pencil skirt's form-fitting nature might be too bold, so consider the occasion when choosing your outfit. To divert attention from your lower half, choose dark, solid-colored skirts and pair them with patterned or textured tops to draw the eye upward, creating a balanced look that highlights your upper body. This combination helps achieve a harmonious silhouette by emphasizing your features strategically. Ensure the hemline doesn't fall at the widest part of your thighs, as skirts that hit just above or below the knees are usually more flattering, creating a more balanced silhouette by elongating your legs. This hemline choice can enhance your proportions, offering a sleek and elegant appearance. If a standard pencil skirt doesn't flatter your curves, don't give up; try one with added slits or darts sewn in to subtly change its shape and make it more appealing by creating a more defined waistline. These design elements can adjust the fit, offering a custom-like feel that complements your shape. To make your hips and legs look leaner, consider a pencil skirt with two vertical darts in the front to draw in your waist and encourage an up-and-down visual flow, helping to create a longer, leaner line. This detail can refine your silhouette, emphasizing your best features. For a narrow waist and wider thighs, look for a skirt with a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 8 cm) slit in the back hemline, giving your legs room to move while keeping the waistband cinched and adding a sultrier touch, which can create a more dramatic silhouette that enhances your curves. This slit allows for ease of movement and adds an element of intrigue to your outfit, perfect for making a bold impression."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 25.236125946044922, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.8241100311279297, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 26 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 24 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "When choosing a pencil skirt, it's essential to ensure that it fits your body well, as the right fit can significantly enhance your appearance.

For versatility, you can stick to classic options, but if you're feeling adventurous, selecting a unique pattern or fabric can add flair to your outfit. A black pencil skirt is a timeless staple, perfect for those seeking a single, easy-to-style piece in their wardrobe. While vibrant colors and patterns may pose some styling challenges, a black skirt effortlessly transitions from professional settings to casual outings to more seductive occasions.\n\nThe color, pattern, and texture of a skirt can significantly impact your look. Straying from the traditional black pencil skirt draws more attention to your lower body. While pencil skirts flatter most body types, those with pronounced curves may need to be more discerning in their styling choices. Since pencil skirts emphasize the thighs, they can accentuate lower body curves, which might not be suitable for every occasion.\n\nTo divert attention from your lower half, choose pencil skirts in dark, solid colors and pair them with patterned or textured tops. A visually engaging top draws the eye upward, away from your lower body. Be mindful of the hemline, ensuring it doesn't end at the widest part of your thighs, as this can exaggerate their volume. Skirts that fall just above or below the knees typically offer a more flattering appearance, as these are the narrower parts of the leg.\n\nIf a standard pencil skirt doesn't suit your curves, don't lose hope. Consider trying a skirt with a removed slit or added darts. These subtle alterations can change the skirt's shape and make it more appealing. For a leaner look, choose a pencil skirt with two vertical darts sewn into the front. These darts draw in the waist and direct the viewer's gaze vertically, rather than horizontally.\n\nFor those with a narrow waist and wider thighs, a pencil skirt with a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 8 cm) slit in the back hemline is worth considering. This feature provides more room for movement while ensuring the waistband remains snug and properly fitted. Additionally, slits can imbue the skirt with a sultrier, more flirtatious vibe, enhancing its overall allure. With these tips in mind, you can confidently choose a pencil skirt that not only flatters your figure but also complements your personal style."}}

Many schools offer accommodations for students with learning disabilities, including note-taking assistance. If you have a learning disability, check with your school\u2019s office of academic accessibility. Recording lectures can be helpful. Most smartphones have built-in voice recorders, or you can download a recording app. Recording a lecture will allow you to go back and hear it again. If there\u2019s anything in your notes that confuses you or that you feel might be wrong, check with your teacher or a classmate to ensure you have the right information. If you wait too long to read your notes, you may not remember enough of the class to make sense of them. Condensing your notes can aid comprehension by testing your understanding of the material to ensure you\u2019ve really grasped the meaning. You\u2019ll need to have a study area that is free of disruptions; this might be your bedroom, a library, or another room, so be honest with yourself about your needs. For example, if you\u2019re distracted by looking out the window, move your work area so that you can\u2019t see outside from where you work. Wear headphones over your ears if you need to avoid being distracted by ambient sound. Some people benefit from using a fan facing the wall to generate white noise, and you could also download a free \"white noise\" app onto your phone. Studying for long periods without breaks will lead to boredom and distractibility. Instead, study in blocks with short breaks in between. Stand up and move around away from your study area. You might set a timer to remind you to take a break after 45-60 minutes. Set another timer to remind you to return to your desk. A 10-minute break is usually a good length. When studying your notes, refer to the textbooks you\u2019ve been given and supplement with online resources; use internet searches to supplement your understanding when your subject matter might be better explained by another source, and using visual information, graphics, and videos can help you understand the lectures. If the resources you find provide information that contradicts what you've learned in class, take careful notes and ask your teacher. Science might seem like a collection of facts, but each fact was discovered through someone trying to answer the question \u201cWhy?\u201d, and understanding how things fit together will help you make sense of the facts. A cannon, being larger than a cannonball, propels the ball a great distance when fired, which demonstrates the interaction of forces according to Newton's Third Law, a principle fundamental in understanding how forces work in science. A lot of science is done using the metric system. This is the system most commonly used internationally. The system that most Americans use is called the Imperial system. However, even American scientists use the metric system at work. It can be helpful to learn basic conversions from Imperial to metric, particularly for chemistry. When you think you understand the material, try to explain it to someone else. Teaching another person is the best way to know if you really understand the material. Testing your knowledge with a friend or family member will help you assess your own understanding.

Recording lectures on your smartphone can also be beneficial, allowing you to revisit and clarify any confusing parts of your notes. If something in your notes seems unclear or incorrect, verify it with your teacher or classmates promptly.\n\nTo enhance understanding, rewrite your notes in a concise format soon after class. This helps reinforce your grasp of the material. Establish a distraction-free study area, which could be your bedroom, a library, or another quiet room. Be honest about your needs; for instance, if you tend to gaze out of windows, position your workspace away from them. Use headphones to block out ambient noise, or consider using a fan or a white noise app to minimize auditory distractions.\n\nAvoid prolonged study sessions, which can lead to boredom and loss of focus. Instead, study in blocks of 45-60 minutes, interspersed with 10-minute breaks. Use a timer to remind you to take and end these breaks. While reviewing your notes, supplement your learning with textbooks and online resources, like Khan Academy, which might offer clearer explanations. If you find conflicting information, make detailed notes and discuss these with your teacher to deepen your understanding.\n\nUnderstanding the interconnectedness of scientific facts is crucial. For instance, imagining a cannon firing can illustrate Newton\u2019s Third Law: \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d This law is demonstrated when the cannonball\u2019s force pushes the cannon backward. Familiarize yourself with the metric system, which is commonly used in science and is based on units of 10. Understanding basic conversions between the Imperial and metric systems can be particularly useful in fields like chemistry.\n\nTest your comprehension by explaining the material to someone else. Teaching is an excellent way to confirm your understanding. Engage a friend or family member as your audience, or create potential exam questions. Develop new examples from your experiences to reinforce learning. Study techniques vary; yours might include creating flashcards, storytelling, or composing songs to remember key details. If group study benefits you, form a study group with classmates, ensuring the focus remains on learning rather than socializing. If you prefer studying alone, maintain your concentration by minimizing distractions."}}

If you get paid monthly, you might pay bills once a month. If you get paid bi-weekly, you may choose two specific days each month to pay your bills. Whatever system you use, be consistent. Bills are often late because people might forget or become too busy, leading to missed payments. Mark your calendar or create a reminder on your phone to help you remember to pay your bills. You may need to adjust your payment day for holidays or vacations since your bill amounts may change each month. The amounts of your bills may fluctuate each month. At the beginning of the month, create a checklist of the bills you are expecting. Have a place on the checklist to mark if the bill was received and when the bill was paid. The list should be kept in the area where you pay your bills. If you are expecting a bill but do not receive it, check with the company to see if there was an error. You do not want to pay a bill late because you were not on top of things. Your list can be handwritten or electronic. Do what works best for you. Automated bill pay is good for expenses that do not change every month, such as phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Find out on which dates the money will be deducted and write them down so that you are sure there is enough money in your account to cover it. Automated payment is not ideal for bills that vary each month, like your credit card bill. You can throw off your budget if the bill is higher than you expected.

Notifications can remind you to verify your account balance to ensure the funds are available and to pay your bill on time. Set up an online account for each of your bills. You can even connect the account to one of your bank accounts so you do not have to enter your payment information each month. Paying online saves you time and resources. You will not have to buy envelopes, stamps, or checks if you use this method. An online account also gives you immediate access to other helpful information about your account such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Online payments are also processed faster than checks. There will be less lag time between your payment and your bank account balance. If you are sending a check in the mail, be sure that the check arrives by the due date or is postmarked before the due date. If you can, pay your bill as soon as it arrives to avoid forgetting about it or mailing it in too late. Make sure you are always stocked with the necessary bill-paying supplies such as envelopes, stamps, and checks. Staying organized ensures you don't miss payments due to unforeseen circumstances like unexpected closures. Having a clear system helps you manage your finances effectively and prevents last-minute scrambles. Staying on top of your bills is crucial for maintaining a good credit score and avoiding late fees. It's also essential to regularly review your budget and adjust your payment schedule as needed to ensure you're not overpaying for any services. By following these steps and staying organized, you can ensure that your bills are always paid on time and you can avoid any potential financial pitfalls."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 23.459787368774414, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.4198391437530518, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 28 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 24 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Setting aside dedicated time each month to pay your bills is a crucial step in maintaining financial stability and avoiding unnecessary stress. For those who receive a monthly paycheck, it might make sense to designate one day each month specifically for settling all outstanding payments. Conversely, if you are paid bi-monthly, you may find it practical to have two designated bill-paying days each month. Regardless of the system you choose, the key is consistency. Many bills end up being paid late simply because there isn\u2019t a specific time set aside to handle them. \n\nTo help you remember to pay your bills, it can be beneficial to mark your calendar or set up a recurring reminder on your phone. Life can be unpredictable, and you may need to adjust your payment days around holidays or vacations. It\u2019s important to be flexible and ensure that your bill-paying schedule accommodates such changes. \n\nAt the beginning of each month, create a checklist of the bills you are expecting. This list should include spaces to note whether the bill has been received and the date it was paid. Keeping this list in the area where you pay your bills can help streamline the process and prevent oversight. If you are expecting a bill but do not receive it, promptly contact the company to address any potential errors. Being proactive about this can prevent late payments and associated fees.\n\nThe format of your list can be either handwritten or electronic, depending on what works best for you. Some people find that a digital list on their phone or computer helps them stay organized and efficient, while others prefer the tactile nature of a handwritten list. Automated bill pay can be a convenient tool for managing expenses that remain constant each month, such as phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Make sure to note the dates when the money will be deducted from your account to ensure you have sufficient funds available.\n\nHowever, automated payments may not be ideal for bills that vary from month to month, such as credit card bills. If the bill is higher than anticipated, it can disrupt your budget. If you do opt for automatic payments for your credit card bill, ensure that you are at least covering the minimum amount due. Be aware that some companies may charge a fee for automatic bill pay services, so verify that it is a complimentary feature before enrolling.\n\nWhen setting up your online account, consider signing up for notifications about your upcoming bills. These alerts can serve as helpful reminders to check your account, confirm the availability of funds, and make timely payments. Establishing an online account for each of your bills can simplify the payment process. Linking these accounts to your bank account can eliminate the need to manually enter payment information each month, saving you time and effort.\n\nPaying bills online offers several advantages, including the elimination of the need for envelopes, stamps, or checks. This method not only saves resources but also grants you immediate access to vital account information, such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Additionally, online payments are processed more quickly than mailed checks, reducing the lag time between payment and the reflection of the transaction in your bank account balance.\n\nIf you prefer to send checks by mail, ensure that they arrive by the due date or are postmarked before the deadline. Paying your bill as soon as it arrives can help prevent the risk of forgetting or mailing it too late. Always keep a stock of essential bill-paying supplies, such as envelopes, stamps, and checks, to avoid last-minute scrambles. Remember that the post office is closed on Sundays and federal holidays, which could affect the timely delivery of your payments.\n\nBy adopting a structured and consistent approach to bill payments, you can minimize stress and maintain better control of your finances. Establishing a reliable system will not only help you avoid late fees and penalties but also contribute to a more organized and efficient financial routine."}}

LLMs have become increasingly prevalent in various social-influencing domains, such as education (Kasneci et al., 2023; AlAfnan et al., 2023) and the technology industry (Dong et al., 2023), where they play a crucial role in shaping social dynamics and influencing public opinion. The existence of bias is harmful in this context because LLMs' social influence can further promote underlying legal and ethical implications (Weidinger et al., 2021; Deshpande et al., 2023), potentially leading to unjust outcomes like discrimination in hiring practices and perpetuating stereotypes such as gender roles. Research by Gupta et al. (2022) and Sheng \u2217Equally contributed et al. (2019) has specifically identified gender bias in NLP models. Prior studies on gender bias in LLMs often concentrate on tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis within the English context. They use single-dimensional evaluation methods for gender bias. This approach neglects the fact that LLMs generally receive different types of instructions for various circumstances, where gender bias can manifest in multiple ways (Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023). Considering the diverse language backgrounds of LLM users and the strong capabilities in multilingual reasoning of the LLMs themselves (Lai et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023; Rathje et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), it is crucial to emphasize the various language features and cultural influences that affect the interpretation of language and influence cultural context in how gender bias occurs in different languages. Different languages may exhibit varying degrees of gender bias in the outputs generated by LLMs, influenced by syntax, gendered nouns, and cultural context. Understanding these nuances is essential for acknowledging and addressing the complexities of language in LLMs, ensuring they are more equitable and culturally sensitive across a wide range of applications. To address the limitations in evaluating gender bias in LLMs, our study emphasizes the significant role of conversations undertaken by LLMs and explores gender bias across different dimensions, focusing on how dialogue can reveal biases. In particular, we present three quantitative evaluation measurements for gender bias in LLMs, each designed to assess the effects of cultural context and language on bias. Based on the proposed measures, we conduct experiments in six different languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin, using a range of state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020), allowing us to seamlessly compare levels and nuances of gender bias across these languages. Our approaches facilitate a comprehensive analysis of both lexicon and sentiment aspects of gender bias across different languages, evaluating the impact of language and cultural context on bias. This analysis provides insights into how diverse instructions may influence gender biases in LLM generations, highlighting the complexities of language and the importance of cultural context. The main results of our exploration can be categorized into the following conclusions, detailing specific insights into the importance of language and cultural context in bias and the need for more nuanced evaluation methods."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 44.27958679199219, "some": 0.8992138703664144, "bart": -1.8613110780715942, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 18 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 12 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their application across various fields has been significant, especially in dialogue systems (Bae et al., 2022) and creative writing (Swanson et al., 2021).

They now play an increasingly vital role in domains that influence society, such as education (Kasneci et al., 2023; AlAfnan et al., 2023) and the technology industry (Dong et al., 2023). Their influence is expanding, making their role in shaping social dynamics more prominent. However, this widespread influence brings to light the issue of bias, which can be particularly harmful in such contexts. The social impact of LLMs can amplify the underlying legal and ethical concerns (Weidinger et al., 2021; Deshpande et al., 2023). Previous research has extensively documented gender bias within natural language processing (NLP) models (Gupta et al., 2022; Sheng et al., 2019). Specifically, studies on gender bias in LLMs often focus on specific tasks within the English language and employ single-dimensional evaluation methods (Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023). These approaches often overlook the fact that LLMs are subjected to varying instructions based on different contexts, which can manifest gender bias in multiple dimensions.\n\nIt is crucial to consider the diverse linguistic backgrounds of LLM users and the models' robust capabilities in multilingual reasoning (Lai et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023; Rathje et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023). This diversity necessitates an emphasis on the unique language features and cultural influences that shape how gender bias manifests across different languages. Each language may exhibit varying degrees of gender bias in LLM outputs. Understanding these variations is essential for acknowledging and addressing these biases effectively.

In line with this, LLMs enhance theory-of-mind reasoning by maintaining and updating local and global graphs to represent the beliefs of various characters (Adhikari et al., 2020; Ammanabrolu and Riedl, 2021). Similarly, LLMs use graph-based action plans for structured commonsense reasoning to achieve objectives with various prerequisites (Tandon et al., 2019; Madaan et al., 2022). Furthermore, in multi-hop question answering, LLMs trace connections and pathways within a vast network of entities and concepts (Creswell et al., 2023). Together, these studies demonstrate the wide-ranging application of LLMs to tasks involving implicit graphical structures, with significant success. Nonetheless, a key question persists: Can LLMs effectively reason with graphs, particularly by converting textual graph descriptions into grounded conceptual spaces and solving algorithmic problems using natural language? The resolution of this question holds significant implications for LLM applications involving implicit graphs and their reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Natural Language Graph (NLGraph) benchmark, a comprehensive testing ground for graph and structured reasoning designed for language models. NLGraph comprises 29,370 problems across eight graph reasoning tasks, from simpler ones like connectivity and shortest path to more complex tasks like topological sort and Hamilton path. We control problem difficulty by varying graph size, sparsity, and numeric range, creating easy, medium, and hard subsets for detailed analysis. Beyond exact match accuracy, we also offer partial credit solutions for various graph reasoning tasks. Using the NLGraph benchmark, we evaluate whether different LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023) can execute graph-based reasoning and if specific prompting techniques (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that LLMs have initial skills in graph reasoning. They surpass the random baseline by 37.33% to 57.82% on simpler tasks like connectivity and shortest path. With chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs produce logical intermediate steps, further enhancing task performance. However, the advantages of advanced prompting decrease with more complex problems. Techniques such as chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022), least-to-most (Zhou et al., 2023), and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) enhance LLM performance on simple tasks but are less effective or even counterproductive for complex tasks like topological sort and Hamilton path. Learning from examples does not improve performance on complex graph reasoning problems. Although in-context learning is recognized for teaching LLMs from examples (Brown et al., 2020), its benefits for advanced tasks remain uncertain. Few-shot learning fails to outperform zero-shot prompting across tasks, and increasing the number of examples may impair performance on tasks like the Hamilton path. LLMs are unexpectedly sensitive to spurious correlations in problem settings. In connectivity tasks, LLMs face challenges with specific cases, such as chains and cliques, leading to performance declines of over 40%. This indicates that LLMs rely on spurious correlations, like the frequency of node mentions, rather than robust structured reasoning in graph contexts. To improve LLMs as graph reasoners, we propose two instruction-based prompting methods. Build-a-Graph prompting motivates LLMs to map textual descriptions to conceptual spaces (Patel and Pavlick, 2022) before tackling the problem, while Algorithmic prompting directs LLMs to review algorithmic steps before learning from examples. Experiments reveal that Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting enhance LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities, with performance improvements ranging from 3.07% to 16.85% across tasks, though the most challenging problems remain unresolved.

Moreover, in theory-of-mind reasoning, LLMs play a crucial role in maintaining and updating both local and global graphs. These graphs effectively capture the beliefs and perspectives of different characters within a narrative, as demonstrated by Adhikari et al. (2020) and Ammanabrolu and Riedl (2021). When it comes to structured commonsense reasoning, LLMs are tasked with generating graph-based action plans. These plans are designed to meet objectives that come with diverse prerequisites, as noted by Tandon et al. (2019) and Madaan et al. (2022). In the domain of multi-hop question answering, LLMs are expected to implicitly uncover connections and pathways within an extensive network of entities and concepts, as discussed by Creswell et al. (2023).\n\nThese examples collectively illustrate that LLMs are being widely adopted for tasks that involve implicit graphical structures, achieving preliminary success in this area. However, a fundamental and crucial question remains insufficiently explored: Can LLMs effectively reason with graphs? More specifically, do LLMs have the capacity to translate textual descriptions of graphs and structures into grounded conceptual spaces, and can they solve graph algorithm problems explicitly using natural language? The implications of this question are profound, impacting the application of LLMs in tasks involving implicit graphs and structures, as well as their reasoning capabilities in advanced, graph-based scenarios.\n\nTo address this question, we introduce the Natural Language Graph (NLGraph) benchmark. This comprehensive testbed is designed for language models and involves structured reasoning in natural language. The NLGraph benchmark comprises a total of 29,370 problems, encompassing eight graph reasoning tasks of varying complexity. These tasks range from intuitively simple ones like connectivity, cycle, and shortest path, to more complex challenges such as topological sorting, maximum flow, bipartite graph matching, Hamiltonian paths, and simulating graph neural networks. We carefully control for problem difficulty by varying factors such as graph size, network sparsity, numeric range, and more, offering easy, medium, and hard subsets for each distinct graph reasoning task. This allows for a fine-grained analysis of LLM performance.\n\nIn evaluating LLMs with the NLGraph benchmark, we use exact match accuracy as a standard metric. Additionally, we design several partial credit solutions to accommodate various graph reasoning tasks. Our evaluation seeks to determine whether different large language models, as discussed by Brown et al. (2020), Ouyang et al. (2022), and Bubeck et al. (2023), can effectively perform graph-based reasoning. Furthermore, we investigate whether different prompting techniques, as explored by Brown et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2022), Kojima et al. (2022), Zhou et al. (2023), and Wang et al. (2023), can enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of large language models.\n\nOur extensive experiments on the NLGraph benchmark reveal several key findings. First, LLMs do exhibit preliminary graph reasoning abilities. Specifically, they achieve an impressive performance level, ranging from 37.33% to 57.82% above the random baseline on simple graph reasoning tasks like connectivity, cycle, and shortest path. With chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs can generate intermediate steps that are both sound and accurate, further boosting task performance. Second, the advantage of advanced prompting methods diminishes as problems become more complex. While chain-of-thought, least-to-most, and self-consistency approaches successfully enhance LLM performance on simpler tasks, they prove mostly ineffective\u2014and sometimes even counterproductive\u2014on more complex graph reasoning problems such as topological sorting and Hamiltonian paths.\n\nThird, LLMs do not effectively learn from examples in complex graph reasoning scenarios. Although in-context learning is often credited with enabling LLMs to learn from examples, its benefits for more advanced graph reasoning tasks are unclear. Few-shot in-context learning fails to outperform zero-shot prompting across multiple tasks, and increasing the number of exemplars may even be detrimental for tasks like the Hamiltonian path. Fourth, LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to spurious correlations in problem settings. For instance, in two specific cases within the connectivity task (chain and clique), LLMs perform significantly worse than on the general dataset, with a performance drop of over 40% across various settings. This suggests that LLMs are implicitly relying on spurious correlations, such as using node mention frequency to determine connectivity, rather than engaging in robust structured reasoning in graph-based contexts.\n\nTo improve LLMs as graph reasoners, we propose two instruction-based prompting approaches aimed at better eliciting their graph reasoning capabilities. The \"Build-a-Graph\" prompting method encourages LLMs to map textual descriptions of graphs and structures onto grounded conceptual spaces, as suggested by Patel and Pavlick (2022), before tackling specific problems with a concise instruction. Meanwhile, the \"Algorithmic Prompting\" approach guides LLMs to revisit algorithmic steps for a given task before learning from in-context exemplars. Our experiments demonstrate that both Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic Prompting successfully empower LLMs to better address graph reasoning problems, resulting in performance gains of 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks. However, the most challenging graph reasoning problems continue to present an open research question."}}

You can choose from full strips that fit your entire lash line or individual clusters that you can place exactly where you want a little extra length. For a dramatic effect, try full strip false lashes, like the ones often used in theater or glam photoshoots, to make your eyes stand out. Full strip false lashes provide significant volume and length, creating a bold, eye-catching appearance perfect for special occasions or a night out. Individual lashes are ideal if you want a more natural, subtle look, as they allow for precise application and control over the final appearance. They can be applied strategically to enhance your natural lashes without overwhelming them. If you're using strip lashes, you may need to cut or trim them to fit your eye shape for a more natural look. Start by holding the strip against your eye to measure the correct length, and then use small scissors to trim any excess from the outer edge to ensure a natural fit. Always test a pair of false eyelashes before applying them to ensure they fit comfortably and suit your eye shape, which helps prevent irritation and achieves a flawless look. To secure the lashes to your lid, apply a thin layer of lash glue along the false lash band or cluster, ensuring even coverage and a strong hold. Allow the glue to sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute until it becomes slightly tacky, which ensures better adhesion when applied. To check if the glue is ready, lightly touch it with the tip of your finger; it should feel sticky but not wet. Place the lashes just above your natural lash line, starting at the outer corner and carefully pressing inward to secure them for a seamless blend. When applying your lashes, set your mirror below you and tilt your chin downward, allowing for a better angle to place the lashes precisely against your lash line. Achieving a natural and symmetrical look is crucial, as uneven or lopsided lashes can disrupt the balance of your eye makeup. After applying the lashes, let them sit for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure the glue has bonded with your skin. Gently test the edges with your fingertip to confirm they are securely adhered. To avoid any embarrassment or discomfort, ensure your lashes are well-secured and won't fall off unexpectedly during the day, even when you're busy or on the go. To remove the lashes safely at the end of the day, gently peel up one of the edges and slowly pull the lashes off, starting from the outer corner. If needed, use eye makeup remover to dissolve any remaining glue residue on your lashes or skin, applying a cotton pad soaked in remover and gently wiping away the adhesive. Straight lashes can appear shorter and less full, which is why curling them can make a significant difference in your look. An eyelash curler is a must-have tool for those seeking to enhance their lash appearance. Curling your lashes lifts them, creating a more open and fluttery effect that increases their length and volume. To achieve the longest look, position your eyelash curler at the base of your lashes and squeeze gently. You can find eyelash curlers at drugstores, beauty supply shops, or online retailers specializing in beauty tools. Start with the eyelash curler at the base of your lashes and hold it closed for approximately 3 seconds to create a strong foundation curl. Next, move the curler to the center of your lashes and hold it closed for another 3 seconds, ensuring a smooth curve. Finally, place the curler at the end of your lashes and hold it closed for a final 3 seconds to complete the curl. With these simple steps, you can enjoy instantly longer-looking lashes that will make your eyes stand out and enhance your look. If you don\u2019t have an eyelash curler, a clean toothbrush can serve as an effective alternative, offering another method to achieve a similar effect. To prepare the toothbrush, run it under hot water to warm the bristles, then dry it lightly with a clean towel. Next, run the brush through your lashes, starting at the base and holding it at the tips for several seconds to create a curl. Eyeliner, often considered mascara's partner in crime, can be used on its own to give the illusion of longer lashes. Instead of applying the liner to your lid, trace it right along the base of your lashes to define and enhance their appearance. To further enhance your lashes, gently pull up on your eyelid to expose the underside of your lash line, known as the tightline, and apply liner there to make your lashes look thicker and longer. Choose a dark eyeliner shade that blends seamlessly with your lashes; black is a classic choice, while brown can be more suitable for lighter lashes. For the liner at the base of your lashes, you have numerous options, including pencil, powder, liquid, or cream eyeliner, each offering different textures and finishes.

Regardless, it\u2019s essential to keep your registry contact information updated so that if you do match with a patient, you can proceed with the process promptly. To determine if you're a match, a doctor will compare the proteins in your cells with those of their patient. The greater the similarity, the better the chance of the patient\u2019s body accepting the transplant. If you are contacted as a potential match, respond promptly as directed. The decision to donate is entirely voluntary, so a match does not obligate you to proceed. Consider your decision carefully. Withdrawing from the process may seriously impact the patient\u2019s health, but there may be valid reasons for doing so, such as personal health issues or inability to take time off for recovery. If you choose to donate, you\u2019ll sign a consent form. Neither doctors nor registry officials will pressure you to sign\u2014it\u2019s entirely your decision. If you decide not to donate, inform the registry and doctors immediately so they can begin searching for another donor. Once matched, you\u2019ll undergo a physical examination and possibly more tests, including another cheek swab or sample. If selected as the best match for the patient, you\u2019ll attend an information session where you\u2019ll learn about the exact donation process, including potential risks and side effects, and sign the consent form. At the session, you'll also learn whether you\u2019ll undergo a bone marrow or PBSC donation. You can ask the doctors about the patient, although most information is confidential. Typically, they can share the patient\u2019s age, gender, and disease. For a traditional bone marrow donation, you'll spend the day, or sometimes overnight, at a hospital outpatient facility. You'll be under general anesthesia for about two hours. During the donation, you'll lie on your stomach while doctors use hollow needles to withdraw liquid marrow from two small incisions in your pelvic bone. General anesthesia is used for about 96% of bone marrow donations, though some facilities use regional anesthesia, either spinal or epidural. The procedure extracts only a small fraction of your total marrow, which will naturally replenish within a few weeks. Before a PBSC donation, you'll receive filgrastim injections, a medicine that increases the amount of stem cells in your system. You'll have these injections for five days before the donation. During the procedure, needles will be placed in each of your arms. The process involves removing cells from one arm, passing them through a separator machine to collect the necessary cells, and returning the remaining components to your body through the other arm. The cells collected by the machine include those that form new cells, platelets, and some white cells. Plasma and red cells are returned to your body. The first filgrastim injections will be administered at a donor center or clinic. On days two to four, you can receive your injections at home or work. The final injection and the donation itself will occur at the center. The donation process can take up to eight hours."}}

However, it's crucial to treat the people in your workplace with respect, professionalism, and kindness at all times. Throwing fits or arguing with people you don't like is unprofessional, as it can significantly slow down the team's work and create a toxic environment. Sometimes, you may feel the urge to rush through certain tasks to meet deadlines, but this can lead to mistakes; in a team environment, it can also result in an ineffective work process, as it prevents collaboration and clear communication. Make sure to spend the proper amount of time doing your work well, effectively collaborating with others and maintaining open communication. When you're working independently, your job description may be well-defined and structured, but in a team environment, you may need to jump in and help others in areas outside your job description, as they might require assistance. Being willing to lend a helping hand makes the group work more efficiently and fosters goodwill and strong relationships. In addition, jumping in to help when you see a need can positively impress your boss, earning you brownie points and enhancing your professional reputation. Moreover, you may need help in the future, and if you've offered assistance to others in the past, they will be more likely to reciprocate when you require their support. If you're genuinely excited about your work or a project, you'll likely inspire others to feel the same enthusiasm and energy. When working together, shared enthusiasm can drive teams to achieve better results, as everyone is motivated to do their best and contribute their skills and expertise. Consistently criticizing or speaking negatively about a project can be contagious, leading to a negative environment and potentially derailing the project's progress. Instead of starting the day by complaining about tedious tasks like budget reports, focus on finding solutions and ways to make the process more efficient. You could say, 'I understand budget reports may not be everyone's favorite task, but let's focus on the positive \u2013 they help us secure the necessary funds to pursue our favorite projects and make a meaningful impact.' Remember that every team member is unique, with their own strengths, weaknesses, preferences, and individual needs, so it's essential to understand and respect these differences. Knowing what drives and motivates each team member is critical in building strong, productive relationships, where you work together in harmony, leveraging each other's strengths and minimizing conflicts. Spend a few minutes each day connecting with your colleagues, engaging in conversations, and showing genuine interest in their thoughts and experiences. Ask your coworkers how they're doing, and make a conscious effort to actively listen to their responses, providing empathy and support when needed. Create a safe and welcoming environment where your coworkers feel comfortable sharing their personal lives and experiences, and be a good listener when they do. It's easy to get tempted to take credit for others' accomplishments, but this can create resentment and undermine teamwork, so it's essential to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of your colleagues. Taking credit for others' work can foster animosity in any setting, but it's particularly damaging in a team environment, where it can lead to significant conflicts and divisions. Recognizing and crediting the individuals who contributed to each project component can help build trust, strengthen relationships, and foster a sense of collaboration and unity. When you acknowledge and show gratitude for your colleagues' efforts, they're more likely to feel valued and appreciated, which can contribute to a sense of unity and teamwork."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 37.30175018310547, "some": 0.8886987368265787, "bart": -2.789567470550537, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nAll sentences in the polished text contains more than 11 words, it follows the user's requirement."}, "polished_text": "Navigating workplace dynamics can be challenging, and it's natural not to like everyone you work with.

Engaging in conflicts or fits of anger with colleagues is not only unprofessional but also hampers the team's overall productivity. Although you might feel the urge to rush through tasks, it's important to avoid doing so in a team setting. Rushing can result in mistakes or an ineffective process if you're not collaborating or communicating effectively. Allocate adequate time for your tasks, ensuring you work well with others to produce quality outcomes. In non-team environments, your job responsibilities might be clearly defined and limited to your role. However, in team settings, you might need to assist in areas outside your job description when someone else requires help. Demonstrating a willingness to assist others enhances group efficiency and fosters goodwill among team members. Additionally, stepping up when there is a need can impress your boss, earning you valuable recognition. This proactive approach also benefits you in the long run when you need assistance, as colleagues are more inclined to reciprocate the help. Positive energy is infectious, and expressing enthusiasm can motivate your team to achieve better results collectively. Conversely, negativity can spread just as quickly, potentially undermining the team's progress and morale. Instead of expressing disdain for tasks, frame them positively by highlighting their benefits and contributions to larger goals. Acknowledge the unique qualities of each team member, including their strengths and weaknesses, to build strong working relationships. Taking time to engage with coworkers personally by asking about their well-being helps strengthen these bonds and enhances teamwork. Avoid the temptation to claim credit for others' work, as it fosters animosity and disrupts team cohesion. Conversely, acknowledging the contributions of others promotes a sense of appreciation and unity within the team. Giving credit where it's due creates an environment where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best."}}

Try to work out at least three times a week for thirty or more minutes. This is the minimum amount of time needed to start impacting your body and seeing results, along with benefits like improved cardiovascular health and weight management. Working out doesn't only tone and thin your body, it's also a great stress reliever. If you can't make it to the gym or a fitness class, there are things you can do on your own as a workout, such as bodyweight exercises or yoga. Take a run or a brisk walk around your neighborhood, which can improve cardiovascular health and increase energy levels. You can also buy free-weights at stores like Walmart or Dicks Sporting Goods if you want to lift weights; ensure you select the right weights and perform exercises safely. Stretch before a workout, as it's important for reducing injury risk. Examples include hamstring stretches and shoulder rolls. Stretching is essential to making sure you don't injure yourself before a workout and promotes safe exercise practices. Stretching also increases your blood flow and circulation, which is energizing, improves your mood, enhances flexibility, and reduces muscle soreness. If you enjoy stretch-related exercise, try out a yoga or Pilates class, which can improve flexibility and balance. Start with beginner sessions to ease into the practice. This can mean things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or biking instead of driving, and even walking to work or doing household chores. Doing this won't take any time out of your schedule, but it will make you happier and healthier, encouraging positive lifestyle changes. These are good ways to keep up your fitness in the busy weeks before your wedding, and you can also schedule workouts in advance or find a workout buddy. As you are starting your fitness routine, make an effort to eat healthier, as it supports overall well-being. Choose 1% milk as opposed to 3% to reduce calorie intake and improve heart health. If you are eating a sandwich, choose a whole grain bread for increased fiber intake and improved digestive health. Try to find the healthy version of everyday things that you eat, such as choosing baked or grilled options instead of fried foods. Recreating your favorite foods at home is a great way to do this, offering improved nutrition and reduced food costs. If you crave pizza, buy a pizza crust from the grocery store along with sauce, low-fat cheese, and some veggie toppings, or try a cauliflower crust for a healthier option. This will satisfy your craving in a healthy way and encourages positive dietary changes. Try to make half your plate at meal times contain either fruit or vegetables for better nutrition and reduced calorie intake. They are essential in giving you the vitamins, minerals, and fiber you need for great health, improving immune function and reducing inflammation. Keep fresh vegetables like baby carrots or sugar snap peas around for snacking, which improves nutrition and reduces hunger. Snacking on veggies is filling and good for your body, and you can also make a fruit salad or have a veggie wrap. Food is awesome, but if you're not hungry anymore then it's time to stop, which emphasizes listening to hunger cues. Getting into this habit will help you maintain or even lose weight, supporting healthy weight management and reducing chronic disease risk. Slow down how fast you eat, and really consider whether you are still hungry, practicing mindful eating by putting down your fork between bites. Sometimes you get full before you mentally realize it, so eating more slowly will help you be in touch more with your body and hunger, improving digestion and reducing overeating. You want to glow on the day of your wedding, not be worried about blemishes, so take care of your skin by staying hydrated and wearing sunscreen. In the months before your wedding, be sure to wash your face twice a day with a facial cleanser to improve skin health and reduce acne. To wash your face, splash lukewarm water on your face since it's effective and gentle. Use your fingertips to apply cleanser gently to your face in circular motions, avoiding harsh products and using gentle strokes. Rinse with lukewarm water again and pat dry with a clean towel to prevent irritation and infection. If you wear makeup, be sure to remove makeup before with a gentle makeup remover before washing your face to prevent clogged pores and irritation. Just washing your face will not remove all makeup, so use a gentle makeup remover for stubborn makeup. Do not wash your face more than twice a day, as it prevents dryness and irritation. Washing too much can irritate or dry your skin, so balance cleanliness with skin health. Try to wash your face only at the beginning and end of the day, or after sweating, finding a balance between cleanliness and skin health. Moisturizing protects and revitalizes skin, promoting improved skin health and reducing dryness. Even if you are prone to oily skin, it's important to moisturize daily to improve skin health and reduce acne. It's best to moisturize at the beginning and end of the day after washing your face, using the right moisturizer for your skin type. Taking a bath or shower actually dries your skin, so any time you get wet it is a good idea to moisturize afterwards, enhancing skin health and reducing dryness. You can buy moisturizer that is made for your skin type, ensuring it suits your needs. If you know that you have especially oily, dry, or sensitive skin, get a moisturizer specifically formulated for your skin type to improve health and reduce irritation. Not only can wearing sunscreen prevent skin cancer, it can also keep your skin looking healthy and great by improving skin health. Take care when you are in the sun in the months leading up to your wedding by applying sunscreen thirty minutes before going out in the sun to all exposed body parts, using the right sunscreen for your skin type. Make sure that the SPF is at least 15 or above, as it's crucial for protection. Pay close attention to covering your face, which is a sensitive area that needs protection from the sun. Reapply every few hours that you are in the sun according to the directions on the bottle, ensuring continuous protection. If you are worried about your face getting burned, consider wearing a hat as well as sunscreen for long periods in the sun to prevent sunburn and improve skin health. If you have acne-prone or oily skin, use a water-based sunscreen to reduce irritation and improve skin health. If you are outside swimming, get a sunscreen meant for water exposure to ensure better protection against the sun's rays."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 16.480331420898438, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.730170726776123, "cons_acc": 0.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 40 sentences.

It is advisable to start this regimen approximately six months before your wedding date. Aim to engage in physical activity at least three times a week, dedicating thirty minutes or more to each session. This duration is considered the minimum necessary to begin seeing tangible changes in your physique. Regular exercise not only helps in toning and slimming your body but also serves as an excellent stress reliever, which can be invaluable during the often hectic wedding planning process.\n\nIf your schedule or other commitments prevent you from visiting the gym or attending a fitness class, there are still plenty of options available to you for effective workouts at home or in your local area. You might consider going for a run or taking a brisk walk around your neighborhood, both of which are great cardiovascular exercises. Additionally, investing in some free weights from stores such as Walmart or Dick's Sporting Goods can allow you to incorporate weightlifting into your routine, which is beneficial for building strength.\n\nIt is crucial to stretch before any workout session. Stretching plays an essential role in preventing injuries and enhancing flexibility. Moreover, it boosts blood flow and circulation, which can be invigorating and lead to an improved mood. If you find stretch-related exercises enjoyable, you might like to try out a yoga or Pilates class, both of which offer great benefits for both body and mind.\n\nIncorporating small changes into your daily routine can also contribute to your overall fitness without requiring extra time from your busy schedule. For example, opting to take the stairs instead of the elevator or choosing to bike rather than drive are simple yet effective ways to stay active. These practices can help you maintain your fitness levels during the busy weeks leading up to your wedding.\n\nAs you embark on your fitness journey, it is equally important to focus on your diet. Making healthier food choices can significantly impact your health and fitness goals. For instance, consider switching from 3% milk to 1%. When making a sandwich, opt for whole grain bread instead of white. Finding healthier alternatives to the everyday foods you consume can facilitate a smoother transition to a healthy lifestyle without having to abandon your usual diet completely.\n\nRecreating your favorite meals at home in a healthier way is another effective strategy. If you have a craving for pizza, purchase a store-bought pizza crust and pair it with low-fat cheese, some vegetable toppings, and a good-quality sauce. This approach allows you to satisfy your cravings while ensuring that you are eating healthily. Additionally, try to ensure that half of your plate at meal times consists of fruits or vegetables. These foods are vital as they provide the necessary vitamins, minerals, and fiber required for good health.\n\nKeeping fresh vegetables like baby carrots or sugar snap peas on hand for snacking is a great way to curb hunger and benefit your body simultaneously. While food is indeed enjoyable, it is important to recognize when you are no longer hungry and stop eating at that point. Developing this habit can help you maintain or even achieve weight loss. Eating at a slower pace allows you to better recognize your body's hunger signals, which can prevent overeating.\n\nBeyond fitness and diet, skin care is another important aspect to consider as your wedding day approaches. Glowing skin can enhance your confidence, so it is wise to adopt a skincare routine months before the event. Make it a point to wash your face twice daily with a gentle facial cleanser. To do this effectively, start by splashing lukewarm water on your face. Then, using your fingertips, apply the cleanser in gentle circular motions. Rinse again with lukewarm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel.\n\nIf you wear makeup, it is essential to remove it with a gentle makeup remover before cleansing your face. Simply washing your face will not completely eliminate makeup residues. Be cautious not to wash your face more than twice a day, as over-cleansing can lead to skin irritation or dryness. Ideally, wash your face at the start and end of the day, or after activities that cause sweating.\n\nMoisturizing your skin is another critical step in your skincare regimen. Even if you have oily skin, it is important to apply moisturizer daily. The best times to moisturize are after washing your face in the morning and evening. Bathing or showering can dry your skin, so it is advisable to apply moisturizer afterward. Choose a moisturizer that is suited to your skin type, whether it is oily, dry, or sensitive.\n\nAdditionally, protecting your skin from the sun is crucial in the months leading up to your wedding. Wearing sunscreen not only helps prevent skin cancer but also keeps your skin looking healthy and radiant. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to all exposed areas of your body at least thirty minutes before going outside. Pay special attention to your face, a particularly sensitive area, and reapply sunscreen every few hours as per the instructions on the product.\n\nIf you are concerned about facial sunburn, consider pairing sunscreen with a hat for extended periods in the sun. For those with acne-prone or oily skin, opt for a water-based sunscreen. If you plan to swim, ensure your sunscreen is formulated for water exposure to maintain its effectiveness."}}

Allow your partner to share their side of the story, and listen. Stay on the line as long as needed to help your now-ex along the path to closure. Understand that they may not find peace immediately, depending on their emotional investment in the relationship. When there is nothing more to say: hang up. It's over. Consider mailing a box of their belongings or giving the items to a mutual friend to deliver. Inform your partner of how you plan to return their things and be sure to follow through. This is a kind gesture and may offer your partner some peace of mind, knowing they will get their possessions back. Resolve this as soon as possible, as it will help both of you move on from the breakup. Procrastinating will only make you feel worse about returning the items later on."}}

It was a great way to end the semester after all the new concepts I had learned. The online ARTH 100 course provided valuable insights. Seeing how each artist incorporated concepts into their works of art was truly beautiful. I couldn't appreciate this type of beauty in their work until after taking this course online. Furthermore, one of my many favorites was \"Fowl and Melons,\" an oil canvas painting by Sisson Blanchard, who is from Haiti and was born in 1952. This oil painting was truly beautiful and caught my eye due to the colors and uniqueness of the birds. Looking deeper into the painting revealed details that hadn't originally caught my eye and that I had to look for. That being said, there were watermelons painted among the birds in this painting! Colors had a big influence on how my eye caught these details. The colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue, and purple gave off a warm feeling of harmony. After staring at the painting for so long, I believe the artist chose these colors for a reason, and my theory is this: Due to the number of scattered birds in this picture, the artist wanted to balance this by carefully choosing colors without taking away the painting's uniqueness. Regarding shape, the lines formed by the artist create the shape of the painting, mainly targeting the birds and the prominent details of the melons in between. The texture in this painting is oily, which is ironic considering it is an oil painting, but the details, such as the feather bumps and circles, make the birds appear rough and bumpy. On the other hand, there is a bunch of shrubbery in all the spaces where there wasn't a bird placed. The shrubbery makes you feel as if you would get poked by touching this painting, just as if you were about to touch a cactus. Finally, we have the last element of art: Value. Value is the illusion portrayed by the artist using different shades and tones of light in the painting. Since this painting is very cluttered with details, the strong use of light and color enhances its value. Overall, the trip to the Detroit Institute of Art museum was an experience I hadn't planned on anytime soon, but I'm glad I took this opportunity to look at different works of art and analyze paintings using what I'd learned from this course."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 68.40208435058594, "some": 0.891376813252767, "bart": -2.1959450244903564, "cons_acc": 0.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe sentence \"It was a perfect way to conclude the semester after exploring new concepts in my online ARTH 100 course\" contains more than 19 words, please consider reducing the number of words in this sentence."}, "polished_text": "Visiting the Detroit Institute of Arts was an unexpected and enriching experience. It was a perfect way to conclude the semester after exploring new concepts in my online ARTH 100 course. Seeing how each artist incorporated different concepts into their work was truly inspiring. Before taking this course, I couldn't fully appreciate the beauty in such art. One of my favorites was \"Fowl and Melons,\" an oil painting by Haitian artist Sisson Blanchard, born in 1952. The painting's vibrant colors and unique birds immediately caught my attention. Upon closer inspection, I noticed hidden details like watermelons nestled among the birds. The colors\u2014red, orange, yellow, deep blue, and purple\u2014created a warm harmony. I believe the artist chose these colors to balance the scattered birds while maintaining the painting's uniqueness. The shapes in the painting are defined by lines, highlighting the birds and subtle melon details. The oily texture adds depth, with feather bumps and circles giving the birds a rough appearance. The dense shrubbery fills spaces without birds, creating a tactile sensation similar to touching a cactus. The painting's value, achieved through varied shades and tones, enhances the cluttered yet detailed composition. Overall, the trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts was a valuable and unplanned opportunity. I'm grateful for the chance to analyze different works of art using the knowledge gained from my course. It was enlightening to see how artists, like Sisson Blanchard, express beauty through something as simple as oil pastels."}}

Keep it in a dark space at around 70\u00b0F. Humidor bags are available at many cigar shops and keep cigars fresh for weeks. Talk to the tobacconist about storage and learn from them. Use a clean, slightly moist towel with distilled water. Check the bag for dampness after a few hours. Open the bag more if dampness accumulates. Cigars can mold if too moist. Alternatively, use a plastic tub with a slightly damp towel for storage. Temperature is the most important factor in cigar storage. If your cigar is wrapped, keep it wrapped until smoking. Cellophane allows air, while other tubes protect during transport. Some enthusiasts disagree on storing cigars in sleeves. For short periods, storage method doesn't matter much. For longer storage, use a humidor or smoke it soon. Freezing or refrigerating cigars is a misconception; it affects flavor. Never store cigars in the refrigerator, even if temperatures vary. Cigars need to breathe, so avoid sealed environments. Don't store cigars in a sealable plastic box or freezer. A moist towel in a plastic box can oversaturate cigars. If you can't store cigars at 70/70, find a cool or warm spot accordingly. You can spritz water in the air as a temporary humidifier. If all else fails, just smoke the cigar. When buying cigars, ask for advice if you lack storage. Ask for old cigar boxes, preferably cedar, if available. Kept in a cigar box in a cool room, cigars will be fine for a while."}}

When you are moving down the hallways, walk with your back straight and your shoulders back. Good posture not only conveys confidence and self-assurance but also improves your physical health and energy levels, making you appear more approachable and engaged in your environment. Don\u2019t be afraid to make eye contact with people; instead of looking down at the ground as you walk, maintain eye contact to foster stronger connections and demonstrate attentiveness and respect in social interactions. Maintaining eye contact shows confidence and interest, making conversations more engaging and helping to build trust and rapport. When you speak, try to talk loudly enough for people to hear you clearly. Speaking clearly and loudly not only ensures your message is understood but also projects confidence, encouraging others to listen and engage with you. You can still walk and talk with confidence even if you feel nervous and unsure of yourself\u2014chances are people won\u2019t notice your nerves, and by maintaining a steady voice and deliberate movements, you will still appear confident. For example, rehearsing your speech or presentation multiple times can help reduce anxiety and make you appear more self-assured. It may sound silly, but try practicing walking and talking when you\u2019re at home, like narrating what you are doing in your bedroom to practice speaking clearly and at the right volume, as these exercises can improve your communication skills in everyday situations. Practicing confident communication regularly helps you internalize these behaviors, making them second nature and enhancing your interactions in various settings. Rather than being a follower, try your best in your classes and make an effort to share your ideas with others, as taking initiative and contributing actively in discussions helps foster a sense of leadership. For instance, when you take the lead in classroom discussions, it can encourage others to participate, creating a more dynamic and engaging learning environment. Encourage others to do their best and offer to help others when you can, as being a supportive and helpful leader creates a positive environment and fosters mutual respect. Being a supportive leader builds trust and credibility, motivating others to collaborate and contribute their best efforts. By establishing yourself as a leader, others will be drawn to you, eager to spend time with you, as effective leaders inspire and motivate those around them with their vision, empathy, and decisiveness. Strong communication skills and emotional intelligence are also key traits of an effective leader, enabling them to navigate complex situations and foster meaningful connections. Part of being a leader is being open-minded and letting other people have turns. Being open-minded and inclusive encourages a collaborative atmosphere where diverse ideas are valued, leading to innovative solutions and shared success. Try to be patient with others and not rush to be first, as patience allows for diverse contributions that enrich group experiences and strengthen relationships. Patience can lead to increased collaboration and teamwork, as it gives everyone the opportunity to share their perspectives and ideas. You may be tempted to put down peers who are different from you, but doing so only makes you look small; instead, embrace diversity, as building relationships with people from different backgrounds can broaden your perspective and enrich your life. Embracing diversity fosters empathy and understanding, helping you navigate social and professional environments with greater ease and insight. Be an example by responding to others when they speak to you, saying \u201cthank you\u201d when someone helps you, and sincerely complimenting others when they succeed. Being responsive and showing appreciation strengthens relationships and creates a positive atmosphere, whether in a workplace or social setting, by fostering goodwill and mutual respect. If you are working in a group with other students, show respect by being on time and doing the work you\u2019re supposed to do, as being a responsible group member fosters trust and ensures the success of collaborative efforts. Being a responsible group member enhances productivity and efficiency, as it sets a standard for accountability and reliability within the team. Show respect for your teachers and coaches, as sometimes people think it\u2019s cool to disrespect people in authority, but it\u2019s to your benefit to be respectful of teachers and others, as this demonstrates maturity and earns you respect in return. For example, showing respect to teachers can lead to increased trust and credibility, which may result in more support and guidance in your educational journey. Smile often and try to be positive, maintaining an open demeanor and looking for the good in things, as a positive attitude can uplift those around you and create a welcoming environment. Maintaining a positive attitude not only increases your happiness and well-being but also inspires those around you, contributing to a more supportive and harmonious environment. Being negative or complaining are quick ways to turn others off from being around you, as negativity can create a hostile atmosphere and alienate potential friends and allies. For instance, negativity can lead to decreased productivity and morale within a team, as it undermines motivation and cooperation. If something doesn\u2019t go your way, use it as a learning experience rather than getting down on yourself, as reframing setbacks as opportunities for growth can lead to personal development and resilience. Reframing setbacks helps increase self-awareness and promotes self-improvement, as it encourages you to learn from challenges and adapt positively. If you are self-conscious about your smile, try practicing in the mirror; the more you get used to seeing your smile yourself, the easier it will be to do when you are at school, as self-acceptance and self-improvement are key to building confidence. Practicing self-acceptance and self-improvement can lead to increased confidence and self-esteem, empowering you to engage more freely and authentically with others. Be aware of not posting things that make fun of others and avoid posting photos or statuses that use crude language or inappropriate humor, as maintaining a positive online presence reflects well on your character and can positively influence your social circles. Maintaining a positive online presence enhances your reputation and credibility, making you a more respected and admired figure in your networks. Use your social media to share things about your hobbies, books you are reading, events you\u2019ve gone to, or fun things you do with your friends and family, as sharing positive and uplifting content online can inspire others and create a supportive virtual community. Sharing positive content can lead to increased engagement and connection, as it encourages interaction and builds a sense of community among your followers. Try to keep your posts positive and lighthearted; being a careful social media user gives others the impression that you are kind and not overly concerned with what others are doing, which makes you appear more confident and approachable. Being a careful social media user fosters increased kindness and empathy, as it encourages thoughtful interactions and consideration for others' feelings. If being on social media is stressful for you or causes anxiety, consider limiting how much time you spend on it, or think about getting rid of your account(s) altogether, as taking a break from social media can reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Taking a break from social media can lead to increased productivity and focus, as it frees up time and mental space for more meaningful activities. Take care of yourself, and remember that oftentimes what other people post on social media is curated and might not actually reflect their real life, so maintaining a healthy perspective on social media can prevent unrealistic comparisons and promote self-esteem. Maintaining a healthy perspective on social media enhances self-awareness and self-acceptance, helping you appreciate your own life and achievements without undue comparison."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 22.904024124145508, "some": 0.8967951138814291, "bart": -2.169886827468872, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 27 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 26 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Confidence is a powerful trait that can significantly impact how others perceive you and how you feel about yourself.

Even if you feel nervous, you can still project confidence through your body language and speech. Practicing at home can be beneficial; try walking and talking with confidence in your own space. Narrate your actions in your bedroom to practice speaking clearly and at an appropriate volume.\n\nBeing a leader rather than a follower can also enhance your confidence. Strive to do your best in classes and actively share your ideas with others. Encourage your peers to excel and offer help when you can. By establishing yourself as a leader, you will naturally attract others who are interested in spending time with you. Leadership involves being open-minded and allowing others to have their turn, whether in class, during practice, or while hanging out. Patience is key; avoid rushing to be first and resist the temptation to belittle those who are different from you. Instead, set a positive example and respond graciously when others speak to you. Express gratitude by saying \"thank you\" when someone assists you, and offer sincere compliments when others succeed.\n\nIn group settings, show respect by being punctual and fulfilling your responsibilities. Respect extends to teachers and coaches as well. While some may think it's cool to disrespect authority figures, being respectful is ultimately beneficial to you. Maintain a positive attitude and try to see the good in situations. Negativity and complaining can quickly deter others from wanting to be around you. If things don't go your way, view it as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. Practice smiling in the mirror if you feel self-conscious about it; the more you see your smile, the easier it will be to share it with others.\n\nBe mindful of your social media presence.

Rayner (1998) discusses this phenomenon in depth, providing insights into how humans prioritize information while reading. This ability to seamlessly evaluate relative importance is a key factor in human language understanding. It remains an open question how relative importance is encoded in computational language models. Recent analyses conclude that the 'attention' mechanism in neural models is not a good indicator of relative importance, an issue explored by Jain and Wallace (2019). Alternative methods are being developed to increase the interpretability of model predictions. Bastings and Filippova (2020) propose salience-based methods. Kobayashi et al. (2020) explore vector normalization, while De Cao et al. (2020) investigate subset erasure. However, the cognitive plausibility of these representations remains unclear. In human language processing, relative importance can be approximated by tracking eye movements. The ZuCo dataset records fixation duration for words, as demonstrated by Rayner (1977) with the word 'Mary'. It has been shown that fixation duration and the relative importance of text segments are strongly correlated in natural reading, allowing direct links at the token level (Malmaud et al., 2020). In a prior example, Rayner demonstrated that the phrase 'Mary French' receives more attention and is considered more important by readers than 'Laurence'. Being able to reliably predict eye movement patterns from language input would bring us closer to understanding the cognitive plausibility of these models. While contextualized neural models are less interpretable compared to psycholinguistic models, they achieve high performance in language tasks (Merkx and Frank, 2020). These models can be fitted to cognitive features like self-paced reading times and N400 strength. Approaches to predict cognitive signals indicate that neural representations encode similar information as humans. Wehbe et al. (2014), Abnar et al. (2019), Sood et al. (2020), and Schrimpf et al. (2020) explore this. Model performance can be improved by adjusting the inductive bias using cognitive signals. Research contributions include those by Hollenstein et al. (2019), Toneva and Wehbe, and Takmaz et al. (2020). Psycholinguistic work often focuses on specific phenomena tested with constructed stimuli (Hale, 2017). Our focus is on generating token-level predictions from natural reading. We fine-tune transformer models on human eye movement data. We analyze their ability to predict reading behavior across various features, datasets, and languages. We compare the performance of monolingual and multilingual transformer models. Multilingual models represent languages in a shared space, facilitating universal language understanding. Because eye-tracking patterns are consistent across languages for certain phenomena, we hypothesize that multilingual models may provide more plausible representations. They might outperform language-specific models in predicting reading measures. We test this hypothesis on six datasets of four Indo-European languages: English, German, Dutch, and Russian. We find that pretrained transformers predict reading time measures accurately. Multilingual models show an advantage over language-specific models, especially with less data. The transformer's accuracy is remarkable compared to previous reading models. Our results indicate that transformers encode relative importance comparably to human processing.

Fixation duration correlates with text segment importance in natural reading (Malmaud et al., 2020).

Predicting eye movement patterns could enhance understanding of cognitive plausibility in models. Contextualized neural models outperform psycholinguistic models but are less interpretable. They align well with cognitive features like reading times and N400 strength (Merkx and Frank, 2020). Strategies to predict cognitive signals (e.g., brain activity) suggest neural representations encode human-like information (Wehbe et al., 2014; Abnar et al., 2019; Sood et al., 2020; Schrimpf et al., 2020). However, transformer models' ability to predict gaze patterns remains underexplored. Model performance improves when incorporating human cognitive signals like eye tracking or EEG data (Hollenstein et al., 2019; Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Takmaz et al., 2020). Psycholinguistic research typically examines specific language phenomena with controlled stimuli (Hale, 2017). We focus on predicting token-level behavior in natural reading. We fine-tune transformers on eye movement data to predict reading behavior across features, datasets, and languages. Monolingual and multilingual transformer models are compared. Multilingual models aim for universal language understanding by representing languages in a joint space.

Results show transformers accurately predict reading times in Indo-European languages. Multilingual models outperform language-specific ones, especially with less data.

Being able to \"live off the land\" by selling parking has helped me feel entrepreneurial while also reducing stress by providing a safety cushion of savings. I also found myself being responsible and helpful to the customers that were parking. I learned that customers might have many questions about the event that they were attending. I tried to prepare beforehand by reading details about gate opening times and other event-related information, so that I could answer questions they might have when they were parking for the event. I have been pleasantly surprised because I made far more money than I anticipated making, no one had any problems with their cars, and my neighbors were able to make a good amount of money by entering into the 50/50 agreement with me, so the whole block of residents has enjoyed added happiness in recent months as a result of me first doing parking for the Garth Brooks concert 8-and-a-half months ago. I also got to enjoy the satisfaction of offering tailgating opportunities to football fans who wanted to arrive early before game time. The tailgate parties that developed on my parking lots remained safe, and I made sure to patrol the areas regularly. I wanted to ensure that the vehicles were not threatened, people behaved appropriately, and the area was kept clean during the event. Overall, this economic experiment of managing parking for the Garth Brooks concert turned out to be a great idea, and I look forward to more parking opportunities in the months ahead."}}

If you get paid monthly, you might pay bills once a month. If you get paid twice a month, you may have two days a month on which you pay bills. Whatever system you use, be consistent. Bills are often late because people do not regularly set aside time to pay them. Mark your calendar or create a reminder on your phone to help you remember to pay your bills. You may need to adjust your payment day for holidays or vacation times. Your bills may fluctuate each month, so at the beginning of the month, create a checklist of the bills you are expecting. The list should be kept in the area where you pay your bills. If you are expecting a bill but do not receive it, check with the company to see if there was an error. You do not want to pay a bill late because you forgot to keep track of it. Your list can be handwritten or electronic. Do what works best for you. Automated bill pay is good for expenses that do not change each month, such as phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Find out when the money will be deducted and write down the dates to ensure there is enough money in your account to cover them. Automated bill pay is not ideal for bills that may vary every month, such as your credit card bill. Your budget can be disrupted if the bill is higher than you expect. If you are using automatic payments for your credit card bill, make sure that you are at least paying the minimum amount. Some companies charge fees for automatic bill payments, so ensure that they are a free service. When you create your online account, sign up to receive notifications about your upcoming bills to stay informed. These can remind you to check your account to make sure the funds are there and to pay your bill on time. Set up an online account for each of your bills, and connect the account to one of your bank accounts so you do not have to enter your payment information each month. Paying online saves you time and resources. You will not have to buy envelopes, stamps, or checks if you use this method. An online account also gives you immediate access to other helpful information about your account such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Online payments are also processed faster than checks. There will be less lag time between your payment and your bank account balance. If you are sending a check in the mail, be sure that the check arrives by the due date or is postmarked before the due date. If possible, pay your bill as soon as it arrives to avoid forgetting about it or mailing it too late. Ensure you are always stocked with the necessary bill-paying supplies, such as envelopes, stamps, and checks. Keep in mind that the post office is closed on Sundays and Federal holidays."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 32.66969299316406, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -2.5895564556121826, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 36 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 24 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Paying bills can be a daunting task, but establishing a consistent routine can help ensure that all your financial obligations are met on time. Begin by setting aside dedicated time each month specifically for managing bill payments. If your income is structured on a monthly basis, you might find it convenient to pay all your bills once a month. Conversely, if you receive your paycheck bi-weekly, consider allocating two specific days each month for this task. Consistency is key, regardless of the system you choose. Many late payments occur simply because people neglect to allocate a specific time to pay their bills. To prevent this, mark your calendar or set a recurring reminder on your phone to jog your memory when bill payments are due. \n\nBe mindful of holidays or vacation periods that might necessitate an adjustment in your payment schedule. It's important to be proactive to avoid any disruptions. Each month, your bills may vary, so at the beginning of the month, compile a checklist of the anticipated bills. This checklist should have spaces to note whether the bill has been received and the date it was paid. Keep this list in the area where you typically handle your finances; it's a simple yet effective method to stay organized. If you notice a bill hasn't arrived as expected, promptly contact the company to resolve any potential errors. Being proactive helps ensure you don't inadvertently pay a bill late.\n\nYour checklist can be either handwritten or digital; choose the format that best suits your needs. Many people find that automated bill pay is advantageous for fixed monthly expenses like phone bills, student loans, rent, and mortgages. Determine the exact dates when funds will be deducted from your account and record them. This ensures that you maintain an adequate balance to cover these expenses. However, automated payments might not be suitable for bills that fluctuate, such as credit card payments. An unexpected spike in your credit card bill could disrupt your budget if you're not prepared. If you opt for automatic payments for credit card bills, ensure at least the minimum payment is covered.\n\nSome companies might impose fees for automatic bill pay, so verify that the service is complimentary. Additionally, when setting up your online accounts, subscribe to receive notifications regarding upcoming bills. These alerts serve as useful reminders to review your account balances and ensure timely payments. Establish online accounts for each of your bills and consider linking these to one of your bank accounts. This eliminates the need to manually enter payment information each month, streamlining the process. Paying bills online not only saves time but also conserves resources, eliminating the need for physical items like envelopes, stamps, or checks.\n\nMoreover, online accounts provide immediate access to vital information such as due dates, payment history, and account balances. Online transactions are processed faster than mailed checks, reducing the lag time between your payment and its reflection in your bank account. If you choose to send a check via mail, ensure it arrives before the due date or is postmarked accordingly. To prevent forgetting or sending late payments, consider paying your bill as soon as it arrives. Always keep an adequate supply of essential bill-paying materials such as envelopes, stamps, and checks. Remember that the post office is closed on Sundays and federal holidays, which could affect mailing timelines.\n\nIn addition to these practical steps, consider implementing a budget to help manage your finances more effectively. A well-structured budget allows you to allocate funds for each bill category, ensuring that you are financially prepared for each payment cycle. Review your budget regularly to account for any changes in your financial situation. It may also be beneficial to maintain a financial cushion or emergency fund. This reserve can help cover unexpected expenses or fluctuations in your monthly bills without causing financial strain. Lastly, consider seeking financial advice or resources that can offer additional strategies for efficient bill management. By adopting a comprehensive approach to bill payment, you can achieve greater financial stability and peace of mind."}}

In the technology industry, they play a crucial role, significantly influencing society (Dong et al., 2023). Bias in LLMs is concerning because their social influence can exacerbate legal and ethical issues, impacting decision-making and societal norms by shaping perceptions and actions, particularly in areas like media representation and automated decision-making processes. Researchers like Weidinger et al. (2021) and Deshpande et al. (2023) have examined how LLMs affect societal values and ethics, revealing significant implications for policy and practice, including issues of bias and fairness. Previous studies by Gupta et al. (2022) highlight gender bias in NLP models, revealing disparities in the interpretation of gender-related data, which often leads to stereotypes and unequal treatment in automated systems. Sheng et al. (2019) further emphasized these biases, particularly in how models handle gender, affecting perceptions and interactions in settings like hiring practices and social media communication. Research on gender bias in LLMs often focuses on specific English tasks, typically using single-dimensional evaluation methods (Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023). However, these studies often overlook that LLMs receive varied instructions for different circumstances, reflecting gender bias in multiple aspects, such as language nuances and societal context. Considering the diverse language backgrounds of LLM users and the multilingual capabilities of LLMs (Lai et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023; Rathje et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), it is crucial to explore how specific language features, such as syntax and semantics, along with cultural influences like societal norms and communication styles, impact gender bias in diverse languages, affecting user perception and interaction. Different languages show varying degrees of gender bias in LLM outputs, with certain languages demonstrating more pronounced biases, which can significantly influence user experience and perceptions, particularly in terms of how users interact with technology. Recognizing these variations is vital for addressing and mitigating biases, ensuring LLMs are equitable and culturally aware across applications, thereby enhancing fairness, inclusivity, and accuracy by adapting to different cultural contexts. Our study addresses the limitations in evaluating gender bias in LLMs by focusing on LLM-driven conversations. We employ a comprehensive approach that examines linguistic and cultural contexts to understand bias dynamics. We present three quantitative measures that clearly reveal the multidimensional aspects of gender bias in LLMs, highlighting disparities in representation and sentiment, and providing a nuanced view of bias manifestations, such as differences in gender portrayal and emotional tone. Based on these measures, we conduct experiments in six languages using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020). This enables a detailed comparison of gender bias levels and nuances across different languages, offering insights into linguistic and cultural influences.

For instance, if you are paddling on the left side of the boat, your right hand will serve as your inside hand. In this scenario, you would grip the top of the paddle with your right hand, while your left hand should be positioned lower on the paddle shaft. The goal is to extend the paddle's end as far forward as possible without having to stand up from your seat. For example, when paddling on the left side of the canoe, insert the paddle into the water directly in front of you, to the left of the boat. Keep the end of the paddle submerged underwater, and push with your top hand while pulling back with the bottom hand to propel the paddle backward. Once the paddle is behind you and cannot go any further back, lift it out of the water and smoothly swing it back in front of you to its initial position. By repeating this process, you will propel the canoe forward while maintaining a straight course and preventing it from going in circles.\n\nIf the bowman is paddling on the left side of the canoe, the sternman should paddle on the right side to maintain balance. Both paddlers should synchronize their strokes, with paddles entering and exiting the water simultaneously. The bowman, positioned at the front of the canoe, is responsible for setting the pace, while the sternman should adjust their paddling rhythm to match. A \"J\" stroke is a subtle backward stroke used to steer the canoe; for a leftward direction, the sternman should execute a \"J\" stroke on the left side. Conversely, to steer right, the sternman would perform a \"J\" stroke on the right side. The more pronounced the backward stroke, the sharper the canoe's turn will be. A draw maneuver involves extending the paddle away from the boat and vertically positioning it so that only the flat end is submerged in water. Then, pull the paddle toward the boat's edge for the desired effect. During sharp turns, both the bowman and sternman should perform a draw on opposite sides of the canoe. To execute a sharp left turn, the sternman should draw on the right side, and for a sharp right turn, the draw should be on the left side.\n\nIn the unfortunate event of tipping over, secure the paddles and any belongings under the seats of the overturned canoe. Hold onto the canoe, and swim towards the nearest shore for safety. When canoeing in a river with a strong current, avoid swimming against it; instead, hold onto the canoe until the current eases, allowing you to safely reach the shore. If you find yourself far from shore, try flipping the canoe back over with the help of your partner.

However, because of the private nature of medical records, only three large-scale, publicly available medical text datasets are suitable for pretraining models, and real-world, private datasets are often small-scale and imbalanced. As a result, the lack of availability of public datasets is a challenge (Wang et al., 2018). To tackle this problem, we present MeDAL, a large dataset curated for medical abbreviation disambiguation, which can be used for pre-training natural language understanding models. Figure 1 shows an example in the dataset, where the true meaning of the abbreviation 'DHF' is inferred from its context in a medical report about dengue hemorrhagic fever, and Figure 2 shows the pre-training framework. Although this dataset can be used for building abbreviation-expansion systems, it is primarily designed for pre-training. The motivation behind using abbreviation disambiguation as the pre-training task is that abbreviations are widely used and often ambiguous, requiring domain knowledge for understanding. The abbreviation disambiguation task enables models to use domain knowledge to understand the global and local context and the possible meanings of the abbreviation in the medical domain, such as dihydrofolate reductase, dengue hemorrhagic fever, dihydroxyfumarate, and diastolic heart failure. Medical abbreviation disambiguation has been studied (Skreta et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Joopudi et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019). In particular, our data generation process is inspired by the reverse substitution technique (Skreta et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016). Our work differs by proposing transfer learning on other clinical tasks. Existing datasets for medical abbreviation disambiguation, for instance CASI (Moon et al., 2014), are small compared to datasets used for general language model pre-training, and as noted by Li et al. (2019), some are erroneous. Thus, we chose to construct a new dataset for medical abbreviation disambiguation, providing empirical evidence of the benefits of abbreviation pre-training for a wide range of deep learning architectures."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 36.51026153564453, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -1.5890642404556274, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 14 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (less than 23 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Recent advancements in mining medical texts have concentrated on developing deep learning models for diverse medical tasks, such as mortality prediction (Grnarova et al., 2016) and diagnosis prediction (Li et al., 2020). However, the inherent privacy of medical records results in a scarcity of large-scale, publicly available datasets suitable for pretraining models, with real-world, private datasets often being small and imbalanced. Consequently, one of the primary challenges in constructing deep learning-based NLP systems for biomedical corpora is the limited availability of public datasets (Wang et al., 2018).\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce the Medical Dataset for Abbreviation Disambiguation for Natural Language Understanding (MeDAL), a comprehensive collection of medical texts curated specifically for the task of medical abbreviation disambiguation. This dataset facilitates the pre-training of natural language understanding models. Figure 1 illustrates a sample from the dataset, where the true meaning of the abbreviation \"DHF\" is deduced from its context, and Figure 2 depicts the pretraining framework. Although MeDAL can be utilized to develop abbreviation-expansion systems, its primary aim is to enable effective pre-training and enhance performance on downstream tasks during fine-tuning.\n\nThe rationale for selecting abbreviation disambiguation as the pre-training task is twofold. First, abbreviations are prevalent in medical records and can often be ambiguous (Xu et al., 2007; Islamaj Dogan et al., 2009), posing a challenge for developing deep learning models for medical tasks. Second, comprehending natural language in a knowledge-rich domain like medicine necessitates an understanding of domain-specific knowledge, akin to how humans learn medical text through training. The abbreviation disambiguation task empowers models to employ domain knowledge to interpret both global and local contexts and to discern possible meanings of abbreviations within the medical domain.\n\nThe study of medical abbreviation disambiguation has a long history (Skreta et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Joopudi et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019), and our research builds upon these foundations. Our data generation process is particularly inspired by the reverse substitution technique (Skreta et al., 2019; Finley et al., 2016). Our approach differs in two major ways: rather than focusing solely on improving abbreviation disambiguation performance, we propose using it as a pre-training task for transfer learning across other clinical tasks. Additionally, existing datasets for medical abbreviation disambiguation, like CASI (Moon et al., 2014), are small compared to those used for general language model pre-training and, as noted by Li et al. (2019), some contain errors. Therefore, we opted to construct a new, sufficiently large dataset for effective pre-training.\n\nOur primary contributions are: presenting a large dataset for pre-training on medical abbreviation disambiguation and providing empirical evidence of the benefits of abbreviation pre-training across various deep learning architectures."}}

Additionally, water contains no calories, making it a far better choice than sugary beverages that contribute to weight gain. In fact, if you can limit yourself to only consuming water, your chances of shedding those extra pounds will significantly increase. If you crave something with flavor occasionally, opting for unsweetened tea is a good alternative. This should be your go-to beverage choice around the clock, except right before a workout. During that time, you can indulge in a cup of black coffee, or perhaps with a splash of skim milk. The caffeine boost is known to give you an extra kick, helping you to work out a bit harder and more effectively.\n\nInterestingly, drinking water can also boost your metabolism, in addition to making you feel fuller. Recent studies indicate that consuming two glasses of cold water can elevate your metabolism by about 40% for a period of 15 to 20 minutes. Participants in these weight loss studies reportedly lost 15 pounds over a span of three months, primarily by sticking to a regimen of drinking only water. It's important to completely cut out junk food when pursuing more extreme, short-term weight loss goals. While someone following a standard diet might afford to indulge in junk food once or twice without facing drastic consequences, this is not the case for more rigorous weight loss plans. To succeed, you must avoid greasy, fatty foods and those high in sugar content.\n\nAnything battered, fried, coated in chocolate, or preserved with sugar should be off-limits. Take care to read labels, as even foods like yogurt and granola bars can be surprisingly high in sugar. While these are often perceived as healthy options, they may not be as beneficial as you think. Many foods, from pasta to cookies, are rich in simple carbohydrates, which are essentially sugars in disguise. These culprits spike insulin levels, increasing fat storage, and ultimately lead to weight gain. To minimize these effects, cut out processed carbohydrates like white rice, bread, and potatoes, along with cookies, cakes, donuts, chips, pretzels, and ice cream. You might find it beneficial to reduce your overall carbohydrate intake. \n\nLet's be honest: losing 20 pounds in two weeks is an ambitious goal. To achieve this, you may need to put your body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat stores instead of glycogen, which have been depleted due to a low or no-carb diet. This means eliminating sweets, starchy vegetables like potatoes, squash, and carrots, whole grains like quinoa and brown rice, and sugary fruits such as bananas, oranges, and apples. Furthermore, feeling hungry can make the temptation to revert to old habits even stronger. Consistently eating healthy, nutritious foods can help curb these cravings and lead to better decision-making when you're full. Whether or not negative-calorie foods actually lead to a calorie deficit remains a topic of debate. The theory suggests that some foods require so much energy to digest that consuming them burns more calories than they contain.\n\nEven if this theory doesn't hold up, you won't gain many calories from eating these foods. When it comes to vegetables, aim to consume more asparagus, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, garlic, green beans, lettuce, onion, radish, spinach, turnip, and zucchini. For fruits, focus on blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, grapefruit, honeydew, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, papayas, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, tangerines, and watermelon. Instead of opting for beef and pork, choose leaner meats like chicken or fish, which are particularly beneficial due to the fatty acids that provide essential oils your body needs. These oils may also help curb the desire for greasy or fatty foods. When it comes to vegetables, incorporate them into every meal\u2014breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They're nutritious, generally low in calories and sugars, and they help keep you full.\n\nIn the short term, fad diets can indeed produce results. If you're looking to lose weight rapidly and aren't concerned about regaining it later, a fad diet might be suitable for your situation. However, it's important to understand that these diets are often not healthy and their effects are usually temporary. One of the most popular fad diets currently is juicing, along with the Master Cleanse diet, both of which are liquid-based. These diets can offer quick results, but they are difficult to maintain and not advisable for long-term use. If you're desperate, you might consider them, but it's wise to approach their advice with caution."}}

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), a specific RNN architecture, has proven successful in many natural language processing tasks, including language modeling (J\u00f3zefowicz et al., 2015), dependency parsing (Dyer et al., 2015), sentence compression (Filippova et al., 2015), and machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). In natural language processing, it is commonly assumed that LSTMs can capture certain linguistic phenomena. This assumption is primarily supported by evaluating LSTMs in downstream applications. For instance, Bowman et al. (2015) designed two artificial datasets with sentences exhibiting explicit recursive structures. They demonstrated that LSTMs, despite processing input linearly, can implicitly utilize these recursive language structures. Filippova et al. (2015) observed that incorporating explicit syntactic features into LSTMs for sentence compression actually reduced overall system performance. They hypothesized that a basic LSTM is sufficient to capture the syntactic elements beneficial for compression. Understanding which linguistic dimensions are captured by an LSTM is challenging. This difficulty arises because LSTM components compress input sequences into dense vectors, obscuring their role in representing linguistic information. To our knowledge, the only attempt to unravel the reasons behind LSTM performance and limitations is by Karpathy et al. (2015). They employed visualization experiments and cell activation statistics within character-level language modeling. Our work addresses the challenge of interpreting RNN architectures from a linguistic perspective. We introduce the Recurrent Memory Network (RMN), a novel RNN architecture that leverages the strengths of both LSTM and Memory Network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). In RMN, the Memory Block component\u2014a variant of Memory Network\u2014accesses recent input words and selectively attends to words relevant for predicting the next word, given the current LSTM state. By analyzing the attention distribution over historical words, RMN enables us to interpret results and uncover underlying dependencies in the data. In this paper, we present the following contributions: RMN has been shown to outperform GRUs in language modeling tasks (J\u00f3zefowicz et al., 2015). We detail the LSTM architecture used in our work. Notation: Throughout this paper, matrices, vectors, and scalars are denoted by bold uppercase (e.g., W), bold lowercase (e.g., b), and lowercase (e.g., \u03b1) letters, respectively.

The main color is the first listed, while the accent color is the second. For Gryffindor, the colors are Red and Gold; Hufflepuff uses Black and Yellow; Ravenclaw features Blue and Bronze (books) or Blue and Silver (films); and Slytherin employs Green and Silver. The pattern will consist of alternating thick and thin stripes, beginning with a thick stripe in the main color. The main colors are Red for Gryffindor, Yellow for Hufflepuff, Blue for Ravenclaw, and Green for Slytherin.\n\nYou can choose between a stockinette stitch, which alternates rows of knits and purls (smooth on one side, bumpy on the other), or a garter stitch, which involves knitting every row for a bumpy texture on both sides. Start by knitting a thick stripe with the main color. Once you reach the end of the row, leave a tail of 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters), cut the yarn, and switch to the accent color. The accent colors are Gold for Gryffindor, Black for Hufflepuff, Bronze or Silver for Ravenclaw, and Silver for Slytherin. Use the same stitch for the accent color, and again leave a 4 to 6-inch tail at the start and end of the row.\n\nThis pattern will create the distinctive double-stripe design seen on house scarves in the later films. Most scarves are approximately 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Follow this sequence: 20 rows in the main color, 2 rows in the accent color, 2 rows in the main color, and 2 rows in the accent color. To finish the scarf, knit two stitches onto your right needle, use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second, and slip it off the right needle. Continue this process until one stitch remains. Cut the yarn to 4 to 6 inches, thread it through the last stitch, and secure it with a tight knot. Use a yarn or tapestry needle to weave the tail into the scarf and trim any excess.\n\nFor neat color transitions, tie the tail ends together and weave them into the scarf's body with a yarn or tapestry needle, trimming any extra yarn. To add tassels, wrap yarn around your palm three times, cut the excess, and snip the bottom loop. Use a crochet hook to pull the folded end of the strands through a bottom corner of the scarf, then pull the tail ends through the loop and tighten. Match the tassels to the stripe or alternate between the two house colors, spacing them about 2 stitches apart."}}

It started early in the day when the news of her passing reached us, casting a shadow over the morning and setting a somber tone as we prepared for the memorial service and gathered with family to honor her memory. My parents came by to pick me up and take me to the memorial, their presence both a comfort and a painful reminder of the day's gravity, as we leaned on each other for support during this difficult time. Everyone was in a very somber mood, yet the sun shone brightly and the warmth embraced us, creating a strange juxtaposition that seemed to mock our grief, reflecting the internal conflict I felt between the beauty of the day and the sorrow in my heart. We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away, near where my mom grew up, a place rich with family history and memories, which added a layer of poignancy to our gathering, reminding us of the deep roots that connected us all. While driving, I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin, like the time we built sandcastles at the beach, or when we spent an afternoon baking cookies, her laughter echoing in my mind and filling me with both warmth and sadness. She was always so full of joy, with contagious laughter that brightened every room and left everyone feeling uplifted, her spirit a beacon of light in our family, always bringing us together with her warmth and kindness, and it was hard to comprehend that such a vibrant presence was now gone. But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories cascading through my mind, leaving a void in my heart that nothing could fill, an ache that seemed to deepen with each passing moment. Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard, with the air heavy with grief and the silence echoing our shared loss, a reminder of the finality we all dreaded and struggled to accept as we faced this painful reality together. It was just so profoundly sad, all of it, an ache that seemed to settle into my very bones, a weight I couldn't shake, as I faced the reality of her absence, feeling the depth of our loss more acutely than ever. Seeing my aunt was the hardest part, I think, because her heartache was palpable, yet I knew that she had a quiet strength that would help her endure and eventually find peace\u2014a strength forged through love, resilience, and the support of her family, which gave me hope for her healing. My uncle, an ordained pastor, helped with the service, and his comforting words seemed to ease some of the pain, like a balm to our aching hearts, reminding us of the hope and faith that still lingered, offering solace in our time of need and showing us the way forward through our sorrow. After the service, we all went to the cemetery and gathered on the hill in the shade, the gentle rustle of leaves offering a moment of solace as we stood together in shared mourning, the unity of our family a source of comfort, reminding us that we were not alone in our grief. Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, and I started to cry much harder than I had been all day, a release of the sorrow I had been holding back, the reality of her absence crashing down on me like a tidal wave of grief, overwhelming me with the permanence of our loss. All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back made me very sad, and the cool breeze seemed to whisper her absence, making me miss her dearly and feel the depth of our loss, a testament to her impact on our lives and the mark she had left on our hearts. We then all met at a local place for a late lunch and some drinks, the chatter of familiar voices mingling with the clinking of glasses, a bittersweet attempt to find comfort in each other's company, a momentary reprieve from the weight of our sorrow, as we shared stories and laughter in her honor. It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason, a bittersweet gathering tinged with loss and longing, a reminder of the bond we share despite the circumstances, and the love that connects us even in times of grief. I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I returned home, with the quiet solitude wrapping around me like a blanket, leaving me to ponder the magnitude of what we'd lost, the silence amplifying the void left by her absence, as I tried to come to terms with the new reality. I was deeply saddened and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt, their world forever altered by this loss, and I wished I could do more to ease their pain, my heart aching for their suffering as I hoped for their healing and comfort. I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, which hurt me again\u2014the permanence of it all settling in my heart like a heavy stone, the reality of moving forward without her a daunting prospect that seemed impossible to bear. But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way, united by love and resilience, drawing strength from each other as we navigate the path ahead, our shared memories and love a guiding light in the darkness, helping us find hope and healing in the days to come."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 24.697811126708984, "some": 0.8969117005666097, "bart": -2.2339212894439697, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nThe polished text contains 24 sentences, it follows the user's requirement (more than 18 sentences)."}, "polished_text": "Today marked one of the saddest days of my life.

Life had irrevocably changed for them, and the thought of their ongoing journey without their beloved was a painful one. Yet, amidst the sorrow, I was reassured by the resilience of my family. We've faced hardships before, and though this loss was profound, I believed in our ability to support each other through it. Our family bond is strong, and together, we will navigate this tragedy as we have others in the past.

By the end of that month, their condition worsened to the point where they could barely eat, losing significant weight in a very short period. I vividly remember their fear, thinking they were approaching their deathbed because they felt so terrible. Despite their worsening health, they continued to work long hours and take on more responsibility due to their recent promotion. On the last day before finally getting a two-day weekend, they struggled to stand for more than ten minutes without needing to sit, describing their thigh muscles as burning.\n\nAfter barely making it through the day, they decided to visit the emergency room, where they learned they had a severe case of colitis. They were prescribed Tylenol with codeine and sent home to recover. When Monday arrived, the pain was so unbearable that they had to call out of work. Midweek, their condition worsened, prompting another ER visit because they could no longer go to the bathroom. They were admitted and endured a month of grueling recovery. Upon discharge, doctors advised them not to return to work for another month, which they communicated to their employer. Once that month had passed, they were eager to return to work, only to find a less than enthusiastic reception from their colleagues.\n\nAfter a week back at work, they were summoned to the back office and informed of their demotion, as management doubted their ability to keep up. Shortly after, a significant office theft occurred, and everyone unjustly pointed fingers at my friend, despite their perfect alibi. When there was nothing else to blame them for, their schedule and hours were manipulated, leaving them with only one or two days of work per week. It reached a point where my friend felt compelled to quit, as they were unfairly made a scapegoat. This diary entry reflects my immense relief and happiness that my friend has been granted a fresh start, which they genuinely deserve after all they have endured. No one should have to experience such hardships, and I trust you understand this sentiment, my dear papery friend."}}

You don't have to share everything at once. Give yourself time if you're not ready to disclose everything. Make it clear you might not answer all their questions. You don't need to show injuries or share unwanted details. Focus on your feelings when talking to others. Discuss emotions or situations leading to self-harm, not the behavior itself. For example, \"I'm stressed about school and managing my emotions.\" Hearing a loved one is cutting can be shocking. The person you tell might need time to process this news. Be patient with their reactions. You may dislike someone's initial response. Remember, these reactions are often temporary. Shock, fear, or anger usually come from concern for you. Printing pamphlets about cutting can help them understand. Many don't understand self-harm, so reading material can help. If you've sought professional help, involve them in your discussions.

Most reputable therapists use modern, scientific techniques that have been peer-reviewed in legitimate medical publications. However, holistic and alternative methods have also been researched and are effective for some people. Once you think you've found a suitable therapist, schedule a meeting to see if they are a good fit. Different therapists may take varied approaches to tackle your fear, but nearly all will first ask you to describe your fear, inquiring about how long you've had it, the problems it's caused you, etc. Be completely honest with your therapist. The more information you provide, the easier it will be to treat you. Also, be sure to communicate with your therapist about which techniques seem to be working and which do not. You'll likely learn how to confront and control your anxiety. This doesn't try to remove your anxiety but aims to make it more manageable. With a therapist, you'll learn to cope differently and begin to master your thoughts and feelings. Eventually, you'll learn to be more at peace with what you can and what you must learn to accept. One way that some (but not all) therapists approach phobias is to desensitize patients by gradually increasing their exposure to the stimuli that cause the fear, starting with relatively small experiences and slowly increasing sensation so that the patient develops a tolerance. For example, you might simply imagine standing at the edge of a cliff. Then, when this becomes manageable, you might look at a picture taken from a high vantage point. In recent years, virtual reality has offered therapists many exciting possibilities for safely letting patients gradually overcome a fear of heights in a controlled environment. Eventually, when the patient has made significant progress, the patient may take a plane flight or some other act that initially would have caused great fear. Many therapists will assign take-home readings and exercises to reinforce the mental and physical techniques you have been taught. You will be asked to challenge your own negative thought patterns and work on coping strategies on a day-to-day basis.

While being honest is essential, being open and honest also requires a significant amount of emotional vulnerability, which can be a challenging and daunting task, requiring courage and self-awareness for many individuals. If you struggle with being open and honest, consider working on developing this skill with your partner, as it will significantly impact the success, health, and overall well-being of your relationship, leading to a stronger and more resilient connection. Effective, open, honest, and empathetic communication is the cornerstone of a strong and healthy relationship, fostering trust, understanding, emotional intimacy, and a deeper sense of connection and empathy between partners. In the absence of open and honest communication, couples are more likely to experience difficulties, conflicts, and emotional disconnection, which can have long-term and potentially damaging consequences for the relationship, leading to feelings of resentment, hurt, and emotional disentanglement. Be transparent and honest with your girlfriend by sharing your thoughts and feelings in a clear, respectful, and empathetic manner that considers her perspective, emotions, needs, and boundaries, and fosters a deeper sense of connection and understanding. Avoid withholding your emotions or feelings, as this can lead to hurt, confusion, or upset if they are discovered later, causing unnecessary stress, tension, conflict, and potentially damaging the relationship, and leading to feelings of distrust and resentment. If you're struggling to be open and honest, consider having an open and honest discussion with your partner about the challenges you're facing, and work together to develop strategies, solutions, and a plan for improving communication, building a stronger connection, and fostering a deeper sense of trust and intimacy. By acknowledging your struggles and being willing to work on your communication skills, your partner can offer additional support, guidance, encouragement, and resources, which can help to facilitate more open and honest communication, deeper understanding, a stronger connection, and a more fulfilling, long-term relationship. In their enthusiasm to express themselves, some individuals may rush through conversations without pausing to reflect on the potential impact of their words, leading to misunderstandings, conflict, and potentially damaging the relationship, and causing feelings of hurt and frustration. This tendency to rush through conversations is not limited to expressing one's own thoughts and feelings, but also applies to responding to your girlfriend's comments, concerns, questions, and needs, which can lead to feelings of frustration, disconnection, and emotional disentanglement, potentially causing harm to the relationship and damaging trust. Before sharing your thoughts and feelings with your partner, take a moment to reflect on your emotions, consider their perspective, and ensure that your words are clear, respectful, empathetic, considerate, and sensitive to their feelings, needs, and boundaries. Be aware of your emotions and how they may impact your communication style, tone, behavior, and overall demeanor when interacting with your girlfriend, as this can affect the quality, effectiveness, accuracy, and overall success of your interactions and relationships, and lead to more positive and fulfilling outcomes. Strive to communicate your thoughts and feelings in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner, using simple language to avoid ambiguity, misinterpretation, misunderstandings, conflict, and tension that can lead to stress, hurt, and emotional disconnection in the relationship. When responding to your partner's comments or questions, allow her to finish speaking, fully express her thoughts, and feel heard before you begin to share your own thoughts, feelings, and perspectives, ensuring that you understand her perspective, concerns, needs, and boundaries, and respond in a way that is respectful and empathetic. Take a brief moment to process and reflect on your partner's words, considering her perspective, emotions, concerns, needs, and boundaries, and respond in a clear, respectful, empathetic, considerate, and compassionate manner that acknowledges and validates her feelings, experiences, emotions, and needs. Maintaining a respectful tone and attitude is crucial in all interactions with your partner, as it fosters a positive, supportive, and nurturing dialogue, promotes emotional intimacy, connection, and a deeper sense of understanding and empathy, and helps to build trust, strengthen the relationship, and create a safe and supportive environment. While respect is a fundamental aspect of many relationships, it's essential to be mindful of your words, tone, body language, nonverbal cues, overall demeanor, and communication style, ensuring that you're consistently conveying respect, empathy, and understanding for your partner and their needs, and creating a safe and supportive environment. Regardless of the conversation's tone or outcome, it's essential to take ownership of your words and actions, acknowledging your role in the discussion, its progression, and any consequences that may arise, and being willing to learn from your mistakes, grow together as a couple, work on personal growth and development, and build a stronger and more resilient relationship."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 25.43429183959961, "some": 0.8967951138814291, "bart": -2.214154005050659, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nAll sentences in the polished text contains more than 7 words, it follows the user's requirement."}, "polished_text": "Being honest in a relationship involves not lying to or misleading your girlfriend, which should generally be straightforward. However, being open requires a willingness to make yourself vulnerable, which can be challenging for many people. If openness and honesty don't come naturally to you, it's essential to work on these skills with your partner for the health of your relationship. Effective communication, characterized by openness and honesty, is the bedrock of any strong partnership. Without this foundation, you and your partner are likely to face challenges in the future. Always strive to tell your girlfriend the complete truth, avoiding the temptation to withhold your feelings, as she might be hurt if she discovers the truth later. If you find it difficult to be open, discuss this issue with your partner and attempt to explain your reasons. By informing her of your struggles, she can offer extra support and might even help by asking prompting questions or requesting more elaboration. \n\nMany people rush to share their thoughts and feelings without taking the time to reflect on what's being said. This tendency is common not only when expressing oneself but also when responding to something your girlfriend has mentioned. It is crucial to carefully consider what you want to communicate before you speak. Be mindful of your emotions when discussing matters with your girlfriend and aim to speak as clearly and directly as possible. When responding to something your partner has said, allow her a moment to ensure she has finished speaking. Take a brief pause to process her words and contemplate how best to articulate your response. Throughout your conversations, always aim to be as respectful as possible. While respect might seem like an obvious requirement, it is vital to be mindful of your language, tone, the subtext of your conversation, and body language to consistently convey mutual respect. \n\nTake responsibility for your words and actions during discussions, even if they escalate into arguments. Both partners should fully express their thoughts and feelings, but it must be done with respect. It's important to validate your partner's emotions and strive to understand why she feels the way she does, respecting her feelings at the very least. Adopting a respectful posture is also essential; avoid slouching, maintain eye contact, and refrain from multitasking while listening to your girlfriend. Face her and give her your full attention to show that you respect her and her perspective. When responding, don't interrupt or dismiss her feelings, even if there's a misunderstanding. Instead, calmly ask questions to clarify her meaning rather than reacting with anger or frustration. \n\nDuring emotionally charged situations, such as a fight or when feeling hurt, it's easy to make declarative statements like \"You are a liar and you hurt my feelings.\" However, psychologists advise that using \"I\" statements is more effective and reduces tension. An \"I\" statement frames your feelings as personal experiences rather than accusations against your partner. A well-structured \"I\" statement includes three components: an expression of emotion (\"I feel _____\"), a fair and unemotional description of the behavior causing the feeling (\"I feel _____ when you ______\"), and an explanation of why the behavior affects you (\"I feel ____ when you _____, because it _________\"). \n\nIf your relationship is relatively new or you are inexperienced in sharing your feelings, it's wise to take things slowly. Continue working on communication daily, and have an open discussion with your partner about your comfort level with sharing personal thoughts and feelings. Establish a timeline that allows both of you to gradually become more open with one another. Avoid rushing into deep or difficult conversations, and let them occur naturally when both parties are ready. Don't pressure your partner or allow her to pressure you; move at a pace that feels comfortable for both of you. Improving communication, even incrementally, will ultimately strengthen your relationship. Self-disclosure statements can be particularly useful, especially if you're not accustomed to sharing your feelings or discussing deeply personal topics. They allow you to gradually reveal yourself to your partner, with the expectation that she will reciprocate. Consider using self-disclosing prompts like \"I am a person who ____,\" \"One thing I wish people knew about me is _____,\" or \"When I try to express intimate feelings, _____\" to initiate these conversations."}}

Take some dedicated time to reflect on what could help you better manage your emotions. Finding a different way to respond in challenging situations might be a top priority for you. Once you identify your emotional triggers, you can work on developing more positive responses to those triggers. For instance, if you usually raise your voice when your child complains about eating broccoli for dinner, make a conscious effort to maintain a neutral tone next time. If you tend to burst into tears when criticized, practice taking deep breaths and calmly voicing your frustrations instead. Small adjustments can have a significant impact on your emotional health over time. Consider modifying your living space to create a more calming environment. For example, buy some fresh flowers to place in your living room and focus on them when you feel stressed, allowing calming thoughts to flow. If your negative emotions arise from feeling out of control, try organizing your workspace. Eliminating clutter can give you a sense of control and accomplishment. Adding more light, whether natural or artificial, can also help ease anxiety. Open your curtains and consider adding higher wattage bulbs to your lamps. Staying physically fit offers positive benefits for your emotional well-being. Regular exercise can boost your mood and reduce stress, helping you maintain better control over your emotions. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days of the week. Choose an activity you genuinely enjoy, like learning to play tennis by taking lessons or joining a beginner's league. Incorporate more B12 into your diet, as this vitamin is known to improve emotional well-being. Foods like salmon, chicken, and lean beef are good sources to include in your meals. Writing in a journal provides multiple mental health benefits. Recording your experiences and reactions can help you identify your emotional triggers and recognize patterns in your responses. This awareness allows you to think about modifying those behaviors. Journaling can also reduce stress and anxiety, so make it a point to write in your journal daily. Set aside at least five minutes each day to jot down whatever is on your mind. At the end of each week, review your recent entries and reflect on any significant events that have occurred. Managing your emotions doesn't mean ignoring or repressing your feelings. It is both normal and healthy to experience a wide range of emotions. Learn to express those feelings in constructive ways. Talking about your emotions with friends or family can be very productive. It is beneficial to let your loved ones know how you are feeling. Consider saying, \"I've been really stressed out lately. Do you have time to talk things through with me?\" While talking, remain calm and rational. It's okay to express anger or frustration, but do so without resorting to yelling. Hormones can cause significant mood swings and are linked to emotions like sadness, irritability, and even depression. Women often deal with hormone-related emotions during pregnancy, menopause, and menstruation. Track your emotions to determine if they are related to hormonal changes. To manage these intense emotions, try regulating your mood by eating healthy foods and getting regular exercise, as endorphins can help. Consult your doctor about medication if you're dealing with severe PMS, as it might be a helpful option. If you are prone to unexpected tears, it can negatively impact your daily life. Often, unpredictable crying is related to hormones but can also indicate underlying anxiety. Crying is not inherently a bad thing\u2014it is your body's way of releasing emotions. When you cry, don't force yourself to stop, as blocking emotions can drain unnecessary energy. Instead, focus on preventing the tears from starting by taking positive steps to manage your emotions, such as journaling and meditation."}}

The appearance of new model architectures, including the emergence of generative transformers, has brought along with it widespread usage and attention. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have also gained significant focus due to their transformative capabilities. Still, most of these models were trained on large amounts of web content, and while they excel at tasks in a general-purpose setting, there is still a noticeable performance gap when it comes to tackling domain-specific challenges, particularly in specialized areas. One of these challenging domains is biomedicine, which centers around the intricate study of the human body, diseases, drugs, and various treatments that aim to improve health outcomes. Biomedical text is often characterized as highly complex because of its advanced terminology, which frequently includes names of chemical compounds, long-spanning relations, and other jargon not commonly used. This specialized language poses challenges for NLP models trained on general corpora. For NLP models trained on general corpora to work well in the biomedical domain, researchers have turned to transfer learning methods and domain adaptation, aiming to bridge the performance gap in specialized tasks. The most common approach to domain adaptation is to continue the initial general pre-training of language models with data sourced from domain-specific medical corpora, allowing the models to gain more relevant insights into the field. Examples of models adapted in this way are BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) and SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019). These models drew the additional training data from biomedical and computer science research abstracts to enhance their performance. Dropping the mixed-domain approach from previous frameworks, models like PubMedBERT (Gu et al., 2020) and BioLinkBERT (Yasunaga et al., 2022) were instead trained solely on PubMed research articles, with BioLinkBERT even leveraging links (citations) to other research articles to enhance its contextual understanding. While domain fine-tuning of whole PLMs has proven to increase the performance on downstream biomedical NLP tasks, additional pre-training can often be resource-intensive and infeasible for smaller research groups. In situations where computing power is limited, a promising research direction has emerged. This promising research direction has emerged in the form of knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) (Hu et al., 2023), which integrate external knowledge sources to augment model capabilities. It refers to any set of methods that try to incorporate external knowledge into language models, usually by injecting it into the model\u2019s input, architecture, or output. This integration process is known as knowledge enhancement, and it significantly boosts model performance. In a sea of knowledge-enhancement methods, an especially interesting one is the utilization of adapters, which provide a lightweight and efficient way to adapt large language models to new tasks and domains. Broadly speaking, adapters are small bottleneck feed-forward layers that are inserted within each layer of a transformer-based language model (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020b), allowing for efficient task-specific training. The small amount of additional parameters allows for the injection of new data or knowledge without requiring the whole model to be fine-tuned, thus saving resources and time. Adapters plugged on top of large language models will often only have around 1% of the number of training parameters compared to the transformer, making them a cost-effective solution for researchers. The transformer model\u2019s learned parameters (weights) are frozen and left unchanged, and only the adapter is fine-tuned to adapt the model to new tasks or domains. Other than being lightweight on resources, this approach also helps avoid the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where language models forget their existing knowledge from the pre-training corpora when they are fine-tuned on a new, smaller corpus (Colon-Hernandez et al., 2021). This paper specifically focuses on using adapters to inject structured biomedical knowledge from large knowledge graphs into PLMs, aiming to improve their performance on specialized tasks. We provide an overview of existing adapter approaches for the biomedical domain, as well as existing biomedical language models, offering insight into their design and application.

This advancement is largely due to the introduction of novel model architectures, such as generative transformers and pre-trained language models (PLMs). These developments have led to widespread adoption and significant attention within the NLP community. However, despite their success in general-purpose tasks, most models face challenges with domain-specific applications. A particularly demanding domain is biomedicine, which involves the study of human physiology, diseases, pharmaceuticals, and therapeutic interventions. Text in the biomedical field is often intricate, containing specialized terminology, names of chemical compounds, and complex relationships. These elements frequently include jargon that is not commonly encountered in everyday language usage. To address the performance gap in biomedical NLP tasks, researchers have explored transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. The predominant strategy involves continuing the pre-training of language models using domain-specific medical data. Notable examples include BioBERT and SciBERT, which were further trained on biomedical and computer science research abstracts. Moving away from mixed-domain data, models like PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT were trained exclusively on PubMed research articles. BioLinkBERT also utilized citation links to augment its training data with additional scholarly articles. Although domain-specific fine-tuning of PLMs enhances performance in biomedical tasks, additional pre-training is often resource-intensive. This requirement can be challenging for smaller research groups and in situations with constrained computing resources. A promising research avenue has emerged through knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs). This approach involves integrating external knowledge into language models, either within the input, architecture, or output. Among the various knowledge-enhancement strategies, adapters have garnered particular interest. Adapters are essentially small bottleneck feed-forward layers inserted within each layer of a transformer-based model. These additional parameters enable the introduction of new data or knowledge without necessitating the fine-tuning of the entire model. This modular approach means adapters typically contain only about 1% of the total parameters compared to the transformer model. By freezing the transformer's learned parameters, only the adapter layers undergo fine-tuning. This method is not only resource-efficient but also mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge during new corpus training. Our paper specifically investigates the use of adapters to incorporate structured biomedical knowledge from knowledge graphs into PLMs. We provide a comprehensive overview of existing adapter methodologies and biomedical language models. Our research includes extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of knowledge-enhanced, adapter-based models on various biomedical classification tasks. These tasks include document classification, question answering, and natural language inference. Our results demonstrate improved model performance on several downstream tasks and offer insights into changes in model predictions. Additionally, our findings highlight the OntoChem ontology as a viable alternative to other prominent knowledge sources, showcasing its potential for knowledge enhancement in NLP models."}}

Modern organizations maintain a large inventory of contracts and other legal documents, including purchase agreements, employment contracts, and confidentiality agreements. A typical large Fortune 500 organization manages 40,000 active contracts at any given time (Pery and Simon 2019). Reviewing these contracts manually involves significant time and cost, often requiring thousands of staff hours and substantial financial resources, which can be a substantial burden for firms. Conducting due diligence and risk analysis on them is also time-consuming, requiring careful examination of each clause and provision to identify potential risks and ensure compliance with legal standards. However, due to the large scale and ever-increasing volume of contracts, manually segregating paragraphs to derive actionable information poses a challenging task for any law firm or legal department. Therefore, automatic categorization and classification of legal clauses and provisions using natural language processing and artificial intelligence has been of academic as well as commercial interest (Katz et al. 2023, DALE 2019). The primary research interest of this paper is the classification of provisions into topics. This requires two crucial considerations. A) Sophisticated neural network classification methods require a large set of labeled curated data, which can be a difficult and costly exercise. B) The classifier models trained on a general language corpus are not efficient for the legal classification task because legal texts have a specialized language and distinctive vocabulary with peculiar expressions and terms that do not commonly occur in day-to-day spoken or written language. The focus of this research is the usage of transfer learning (Zhuang et al. 2019) techniques because they look promising to address the two challenges. The central tenet of these techniques is to first train a general-purpose language model as a base model on a very large general corpus, without using any task-specific labeled dataset. At this step, the base model encodes the semantic information as lower-order features. Then, fine-tune (Dodge et al. 2020) this foundational model for the classification task using relatively few labeled data points and the weights learned in the base model. By following this approach, higher-order feature representations are fine-tuned, making them more efficient at the specific task. This is achieved by utilizing the lower-order general features learned in the original base model without having to explicitly re-create them. This avoids the need to re-train a large model using a large dataset for the specific task. The aim of this research is to examine the applicability of fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model for the classification task. In support of this, the main topic of a contract will be predicted. The corpus of contracts used is obtained from public domain filings in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is curated in Legal General Language Understanding Evaluation (LexGLUE) (Chalkidis et al. 2021), which uses the LEDGAR dataset (Tuggener et al. 2020).

Reviewing and analyzing these contracts manually for due diligence and risk analysis is time-consuming and costly. According to a study (Dodd 2018), over 50% of contract review tasks, such as clause identification and classification (Zhao 2019), are repetitive and require specialized legal knowledge. However, the sheer volume of contracts makes manual segregation of paragraphs to extract actionable information a daunting task for any law firm or legal department. Consequently, automatic categorization and classification of legal clauses using natural language processing and artificial intelligence have garnered significant academic and commercial interest (Katz et al. 2023, DALE 2019).\n\nThis paper primarily focuses on classifying contract provisions into topics. Two key challenges are considered: A) Sophisticated neural network classification methods demand a large, labeled, and curated dataset, which can be difficult and costly to obtain. B) Classifier models trained on general language corpora are inefficient for legal classification tasks due to the specialized language and unique vocabulary of legal texts. This research explores the use of transfer learning (Zhuang et al. 2019) techniques to address these challenges. The central idea is to initially train a general-purpose language model on a large corpus without task-specific labeled data. This base model encodes semantic information as lower-order features. It is then fine-tuned (Dodge et al. 2020) for the classification task using fewer labeled data points and the learned weights from the base model.

I had never considered surgery because my older sister had undergone surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I chose to live with my condition. Upon reaching adulthood, I spent a year in vision therapy to try to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes reverted and turned inward significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is different from my sister's and that surgery would not cause me to lose vision. My sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He indicated that at my age, surgery was the only viable solution. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon for an evaluation. The evaluation involved the surgeon placing various prisms in front of my left eye, which immediately caused me to see double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes, helping my eyes adjust. My left eye turned inward 70\u201380 points and could only be corrected to 40 points without causing double vision. It was decided that surgery on my right eye would also be beneficial, allowing for at least a 50-point correction. I discussed the situation with my husband, who thought it was a good idea to have the surgery. However, the surgery scheduler contacted me three months later, informing me that I would need a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested because we had already paid $600 for the first evaluation. She consulted with the surgeon, who confirmed that a second evaluation was unnecessary, and the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital, where I underwent surgery on both of my eyes. I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes always prompted people to look at me strangely. Some companies have been hesitant to hire me, thinking there was something physically wrong with me. Children always stared at me, often asking why my eyes were so crossed, but this issue is no longer a concern for me. Just last week, I went to the grocery store and was amazed at how much more respectfully I was treated. It is also wonderful to wake up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes.

Use this method to find the angle or calculate the object's height. Keep the clinometer steady until the string stops. Calculate the angle by subtracting the string's crossing point from 90\u00ba. If the string crosses at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 30\u00ba. If the string crosses at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 60\u00ba. The angle of elevation is always less than 90\u00ba because 90\u00ba is overhead. The answer is always positive. Ensure the angle of elevation is positive and ignore negative signs. For example, if you calculate 60\u00ba - 90\u00ba = -30\u00ba, the angle is 30\u00ba. The tangent is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side in a right triangle. The triangle is formed by you, the object's base, and its top. The opposite side is the object's height, and the adjacent side is the distance to its base. Use a scientific calculator, online tangent calculator, or tangent chart to find tangents. Press TAN and enter the angle to find the tangent. If the result is incorrect, switch to radians and retry.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that they are individuals with their own unique aspirations and values. As a good parent, you must recognize that your children may have different life goals and aspirations, and it's essential to respect and support their choices. Trying to control your children's lives can stifle their independence and autonomy. Accepting your children's desires requires patience and understanding. If you're unsure about your child's career aspirations, ask them to explain their reasoning and listen attentively to their response. Overcontrolling your children can lead to resentment and a breakdown in communication. Encourage your children's independence and open-mindedness by giving them the freedom to make their own decisions. While you might want them to play baseball, it's essential to expose your children to various activities and let them choose their own interests and passions. Your children are growing up in a different world with different influences and experiences. In today's interconnected world, your children are likely to be more aware of global issues and societal changes than you were at their age. Be aware that your children may encounter different values and behaviors, such as body piercing, premarital sex, and world travel, which are more prevalent today than in your time. Recognize that your children are shaped by the world around them and may have a more adventurous spirit than you did. Be open to your children's opinions and ideas, even if they differ from your own. As a good parent, you must acknowledge that your children are imperfect and will make mistakes, just like you did. Mistakes are an inevitable part of life, and your children will learn from them, whether it's a minor accident, a failed test, or a poor financial decision. Allowing your children to experience failure is essential for their growth and learning. By giving your children the freedom to make their own mistakes, you'll help them develop the skills and judgment they need to make informed decisions. When your children make a mistake, discipline them fairly and help them learn from their error by explaining what went wrong. As a good parent, you must be attuned to your children's emotional needs and be available to support them when they're struggling. Your little girl may be struggling because you moved to a new town and she doesn't have any friends, or your son may be going through his first breakup and may be emotionally drained. While you can't excuse your children's behavior, being aware of their emotional state will help you respond with empathy and understanding. A simple statement like \"I'm here for you, and I want to talk about what's bothering you\" can go a long way in showing your children that you care. Try to see things from your child's perspective and understand their feelings and needs. When you're feeling frustrated, take a step back and try to understand your child's point of view to better comprehend their behavior. Make yourself available to talk to your children, even if you disagree with their choices, and listen to their perspective. Children face numerous pressures, including peer relationships, academic expectations, and extracurricular activities. Help your child identify their strengths and weaknesses, and support them in setting achievable goals. Work with your child to set realistic goals and develop a plan to achieve them. Encourage your child to reach their full potential, but avoid projecting your own aspirations onto them. Raising children is an ongoing process that continues beyond their teenage years and into adulthood.

You might believe that your path is the only route to happiness, but being a good father requires you to accept that your children may have different ideas about how to lead their lives. Although you may think you're doing your best by advising your children on what to do or how to live, you could inadvertently stifle their independence by attempting to control them. It may take time to come to terms with your children's aspirations, but if you don't immediately understand why your child wants to be an artist when you are a doctor, ask them to explain and take the time to listen and comprehend. Overly controlling your children can lead to resentment and discourage them from opening up to you. Encourage them to make their own decisions by fostering independence and open-mindedness. You might wish for them to play baseball, but consider enrolling them in a variety of activities, allowing them to discover what they truly enjoy. \n\nTo be a good father, you must understand that your children are not growing up in the same environment you did, even if you're raising them during the same time period. With globalization, the influence of social media, and shifting political landscapes, it's likely that your children are less sheltered and more aware of contemporary societal issues than you were. Consequently, be mindful that practices like body piercing, premarital sex, and world travel are more prevalent today than in your youth. Accept that your children are products of their times and may wish to explore the world more than you did. Although you might feel you know precisely how the world should work, it's important to allow your children to express themselves and share their perspectives with you. If you want to be an understanding father, you must accept that, like you, your children are not perfect and are bound to make mistakes. Life is filled with errors that provide valuable learning experiences, and you should acknowledge that many lessons are essential\u2014whether it's a minor car accident, a failed test due to lack of study, or a regrettable purchase with their savings. Denying your children the chance to fail occasionally means they'll miss important learning opportunities. \n\nWhile you may want to shield and protect them, allowing them to make their own mistakes will help them make more informed decisions in the future. You should still discipline your children appropriately when they err, but it's crucial to discuss their mistakes and guide them in recognizing their missteps, rather than merely reprimanding them. To be a good father, you need to be attuned to when your children are going through difficult times and be attentive to their needs. Perhaps your daughter is struggling after moving to a new town and lacks friends, or your son is experiencing the emotional turmoil of his first breakup. While you can't entirely excuse distant or emotional behavior, being aware of their internal struggles can help you be more understanding and supportive. Simply saying, \"I know you're having a hard time. Want to talk about it?\" can show your children how much you care. \n\nTry putting yourself in your child's shoes. If you're feeling frustrated, understanding their perspective can help you make sense of their behavior. Prioritize your children by being accessible for conversations, even if you don't completely agree with their choices. A child's life can be filled with pressures from siblings, peers, teachers, and coaches. Help your child understand their desires and evaluate their capabilities and limitations, guiding them to set achievable goals. Encourage them to reach their full potential, but avoid living vicariously through them by expecting them to achieve your past accomplishments or dreams. Don't assume that once your children turn 21 or earn a college degree, your role in their upbringing is complete. While it's important to encourage them to become financially and emotionally independent, it's equally vital to let them know you care, are always there for them, and that they are valued."}}

Different piercings have distinct cleaning requirements, so ensure you get clear, written instructions. Clean skin piercings with warm water and non-scented antibacterial soap, like Dial. Alternatively, you can use warm salt water. Avoid using rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide on the new piercing, as these substances are too harsh and can damage or irritate the skin. Avoid using antibiotic creams or ointments, as they trap dirt and debris, preventing the piercing from breathing. Clean your piercing as often as your piercer recommends. Under-cleaning can lead to a buildup of dirt, crust, and dead skin. Over-cleaning can irritate and dry out the skin. Gently move or twist the jewelry while cleaning to allow the solution to reach inside the piercing and coat the jewelry. However, this may not apply to all types of piercings, so always consult your piercer first. Besides proper cleaning techniques, other aspects of piercing care can help prevent unnecessary pain and infection. Guidelines to follow for general piercing care include: Avoid sleeping on your new piercing, as the jewelry can rub against blankets, sheets, or pillows, causing irritation and dirt accumulation. Wash your hands before touching the piercing or surrounding area. Do NOT remove the jewelry before your piercing is healed. If the area becomes infected, the infection will be trapped in your skin. Avoid letting clothes rub directly onto new piercings. Also, do not twist your jewelry unless you are cleaning it. Stay out of pools, lakes, rivers, hot tubs, and other bodies of water until your piercing heals. About 1 in 5 piercings get infected, often due to unsterile procedures or improper aftercare. Always get pierced by a trained professional in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, insist that your piercer shows you how and where their equipment is sterilized. They should have an autoclave and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant. Piercers should only use a new needle from a sterile package, never a reused needle, and always wear fresh, disposable gloves while piercing. A piercing gun is never appropriate; walk out if you see a piercing gun. Go to a professional to ensure a sterile procedure. Check with your state legislation to understand the licensing and training required for someone to pierce you. Do NOT pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you. An allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same as an infection, but anything that irritates your new piercing can increase the risk of infection. A severe allergy might also force you to remove your new jewelry. Always choose hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance of good healing and request materials like stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold. Healing time varies greatly depending on the piercing and its location. Understand the specifics of your piercing to know how long extra care is needed. For piercings like ear cartilage, nostril, cheek, nipples, navel, and dermals/anchors/surface, healing times range from 6-12 months. For earlobe, eyebrow, septum, lip, labret, beauty mark, and Prince Albert piercings, healing takes 6-8 weeks.

Approximately one in five piercings become infected, often due to unsterile piercing procedures or improper aftercare. Always get pierced by a trained professional in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, request that your piercer demonstrates how and where their equipment is sterilized; they should have an autoclave and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant. Piercers should only use a new needle from a sterile package and never reuse a needle. They should always wear fresh, disposable gloves during the piercing process. A piercing gun is never appropriate, so leave if you see one being used. Visit a professional to ensure a sterile procedure, and check your state legislation regarding the licensing and training requirements for piercers. Do not pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you. While an allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same as an infection, anything that irritates your new piercing increases the risk of infection. A severe allergy could also necessitate the removal of your new jewelry. Always choose hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance of good healing. Request stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold. There are numerous places to get pierced, with different types of tissue in areas with varying blood flow. Consequently, healing times can vary significantly. Understand the specifics of your piercing to know how long you need to take extra care of it. For piercings not listed, consult your professional piercer. Healing times for various piercings include: Ear cartilage, nostril, cheek, nipples, navel, and dermals/anchors/surface piercings: 6-12 months; Earlobe, eyebrow, septum, lip, labret, beauty mark, and Prince Albert: 6-8 weeks; Clitoral hood: 4-6 weeks; Tongue: 4 weeks."}}

They use the visual-gestural modality to convey meaning through manual articulations combined with non-manual elements like the face, body, and facial expressions (Sandler and Lillo-Martin, 2006). Sign language processing (SLP) is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that is intricately connected with computer vision (CV) and sign language linguistics (Bragg et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2021). SLP encompasses a wide range of tasks including sign language recognition (Adaloglou et al., 2021), translation, and other related activities (De Coster). Each sign is articulated in various languages and contexts with subtle differences in hand shape, movement patterns, and place of articulation. The screenshots of the videos are obtained from Spreadthesign, while the matrix part is taken from CLIP. However, advances on specific tasks, datasets, or languages often have limitations and are non-transferable to more generic and challenging settings (M\u00fcller et al., 2022, 2023) due to the small, domain-specific vocabulary and limited data size. Recent sign language corpora with a thousand signing hours have been developed for relatively high-resource sign languages such as BOBSL (Albanie et al., 2021) for British Sign Language (BSL) and YouTube-ASL (Uthus et al., 2024) for American Sign Language (ASL)."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 66.33995056152344, "some": 0.8825855255126953, "bart": -2.151411771774292, "cons_acc": 1.0, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\nAll sentences in the polished text contains more than 11 words, it follows the user's requirement."}, "polished_text": "Sign languages serve as the primary means of communication for approximately 70 million deaf individuals worldwide.

Sign language processing (SLP) is a specialized subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that intertwines with computer vision and sign language linguistics to advance research and understanding. This field encompasses tasks such as sign language recognition, translation, and production, as documented by various researchers in recent years. A typical dataset supporting SLP research includes spoken language text, sign language glosses, and accompanying videos, which are crucial for understanding. Examples of such datasets include RWTH-PHOENIXWeather 2014T for German Sign Language and CSL-Daily for Chinese Sign Language, both of which have been introduced by respective researchers over the years. However, significant advancements in specific tasks, datasets, or languages are often limited and not easily transferable to broader, more challenging settings. This limitation is primarily due to the small, domain-specific vocabulary and constrained data size found in many existing datasets. Recent developments have seen the emergence of sign language corpora with thousands of signing hours for high-resource sign languages. Examples include BOBSL for British Sign Language and YouTube-ASL for American Sign Language, which offer much larger datasets for research. Meanwhile, outside the realm of SLP, there has been tremendous progress in deep pretrained models across different modalities, such as GPT for text, masked autoencoders for images, and wav2vec 2.0 for speech. These models are typically pretrained on vast amounts of data, often with minimal supervision, but they exhibit remarkable multilingual and multi-task capabilities. The visual nature of sign languages, with their larger lexical similarity due to iconicity and smaller grammatical variation compared to spoken languages, potentially facilitates easier transfer between different sign languages. This is in contrast to the challenges faced with text in various spoken languages, which often encounter tokenization and out-of-vocabulary errors. However, unlike discrete text tokens, the dense continuous video signals associated with sign languages are computationally expensive to process and pose significant challenges for self-supervised training approaches. Given that SLP tasks and datasets typically involve both text and visual/signed modalities, researchers have drawn inspiration from models like OpenAI\u2019s CLIP to connect text with sign language videos. For video understanding, subsequent work such as VideoCLIP has primarily focused on tasks including action recognition and video question answering. Nonetheless, existing multimodal models such as CLIP and VideoCLIP understand visual content at a coarse-grained level and within generic domains, failing to address the complexities inherent in sign language. This research demonstrates the deficiency of contemporary AI models in comprehending sign language both intuitively and empirically. The current work utilizes sign-language-specific data to train a CLIP-like model tailored for SLP purposes. Initially, the feasibility of this approach is validated through a model named FingerCLIP, which successfully comprehends the fingerspelling of individual letters. Following this, a large-scale pretraining dataset is curated using the Spreadthesign dictionary, encompassing approximately 500 hours of signing. This dataset serves as a foundation for comprehensive pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation on full-fledged sign languages."}}

This allows robots to execute tasks such as sorting objects, navigating environments, and engaging in conversational interactions, enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of robotics systems through the use of LLMs. However, as LLMs are widely used in robotics applications, challenges arise in accurately interpreting humans' natural language commands, such as dealing with ambiguous instructions, understanding personal preferences, and ensuring consistent communication. Our research is motivated by growing concerns about hallucination and inconsistency in LLMs as reported in recent literature [8]\u2013[10], which impact the reliability and safety of robotic systems. Hallucination refers to generating false or misleading information that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the input provided, often caused by overfitting or lack of contextual understanding, leading to potential errors in robotics applications. This is particularly problematic in robotic applications, as LLMs can misinterpret humans\u2019 instructions or generate unsafe commands when they hallucinate, ultimately increasing the risk of accidents or injuries and impeding the applicability of LLM-integrated systems.

Our framework, which can be integrated into existing robotic systems using LLMs, minimizes ambiguity in human natural language instructions, enabling robots to understand and execute the instructions with improved reliability. This is challenging because human natural language is inherently ambiguous, where meanings are frequently implied rather than explicitly stated, necessitating a nuanced understanding of human communication. For instance, given an instruction \u201cGo to the room where I forgot my keys,\u201d the robot must understand the context of where the user forgot their keys to plan and execute the navigation command. Furthermore, the robot needs to determine whether a given human instruction contains all the information about their preferences required to execute the instructed task, emphasizing the importance of understanding user preferences. To illustrate, consider an instruction \u201cGo to the room I like the most.\u201d The instruction appears unambiguous as there is exactly one room the user likes the most, but it does not indicate which room they like the most, presenting a challenge in understanding the user's specific intention. In this example, the robot must detect that the instruction is incomplete and ask the user for more information about their preference, utilizing a detection mechanism to ensure clarity. Drawing from these two examples, we consider ambiguity as the uncertainty in a sentence\u2019s meaning that allows for multiple, equally probable interpretations, highlighting its importance in understanding human language instructions. Instructions with unspecified preferences, though not ambiguous, are regarded as incomplete, necessitating additional information on the preferences to complete the task effectively.

Additionally, recent research indicates that models pre-trained with massive datasets of code can also perform competitively on various tasks, such as code generation and classification. These coding tasks share similarities with natural language (NL) tasks in terms of their problem formulation, which is why leveraging language model architectures initially designed for NL has become a common practice. The design principles underpinning these neural language models differ significantly from those of classic rule-based program generation systems. Specifically, while neural language models treat programs as sequences of tokens, traditional program generation systems utilize language grammar and code structure.\n\nDespite the advanced performance of pre-trained language models on code understanding tasks, it remains unclear what these models have internalized from the code corpus. In this work, we aim to investigate whether large-scale pre-training is sufficient for effective code representation learning. To this end, we conduct a pioneering systematic study to analyze how pre-trained language models comprehend the syntactic structures inherent in programming languages. We introduce CodeSyntax, a comprehensive benchmark comprising programs annotated with syntactic relationships between different tokens. These syntactic relationships are derived from the edges present in the abstract syntax trees (AST) of the programs, as shown in some examples in Figure 1.\n\nThese syntactic relations exhibit functional similarities to dependency relations in NL, where prior research has demonstrated that attention heads in pre-trained language models can help identify NL relation types (Clark et al., 2019; Raganato et al., 2018). To evaluate how well pre-trained language models capture the syntactic structures in code, we adapt this approach for the programming language (PL) domain. Our experiments focus on investigating the zero-shot capability of existing pre-training methods, evaluating these models without fine-tuning them on our benchmark.\n\nWe assess state-of-the-art pre-trained language models for code representation learning, including CuBERT (Kanade et al., 2020) and CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020). These models share a common characteristic: they utilize the same Transformer-based architecture as NL models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019), allowing us to directly compare their performance in capturing syntactic structures. Figure 2 provides a preview of our key findings.\n\nOur primary observation indicates that pre-training alone is insufficient for learning the syntactic relations present in code. Surprisingly, models pre-trained on code do not consistently outperform models pre-trained solely on NL corpora. For example, RoBERTa, which is not trained on code but shares an identical model architecture, achieves better performance than CodeBERT, which is trained on both text and code corpora. This suggests that pre-training on programs as token sequences does not aid in learning syntactic relations. In contrast, pre-training without dependency relations still enables language models to understand NL syntax to a certain degree.\n\nMoreover, for understanding code syntax, pre-trained models perform worse than simple baselines that select tokens using a fixed positional offset. For instance, always choosing the (p+2)-th token as the p-th token\u2019s dependency yields higher accuracy than any attention head for several relation types. Conversely, the same model architectures pre-trained on text corpora achieve decent accuracy in identifying dependency relations within the NL domain, where simple baselines perform significantly worse.\n\nOur analysis reveals several key differences between NL and PL that impact the syntactic understanding capabilities of pre-trained models. Firstly, programs are more structured than NL sentences, often containing hierarchical structures that embody long-term dependencies between code tokens. Consequently, many syntactic relation types in programs are located between distant tokens, making them difficult for attention heads to recognize. In contrast, dependency relations in NL sentences typically connect nearby token pairs, allowing attention heads to more effectively identify the correct relations.\n\nLanguage models are adept at recognizing keyword-based relations, such as matching an else keyword with its corresponding if token. Interestingly, the inclusion of tokens like newlines and semicolons significantly impacts performance in the code domain. These findings suggest that existing pre-trained models exhibit differing performance in PL and NL domains regarding syntactic understanding. As such, directly applying training paradigms developed for NL could be suboptimal for program learning, prompting us to consider designing better approaches for modeling code structure in future work.\n\nThe CodeSyntax benchmark has been constructed to evaluate language models' performance in understanding code syntax, focusing specifically on Python and Java languages.

They are also prevalent in practice. The field of legal visualization has a long tradition of using visuals to clarify complex legal relationships and scenarios. The core advantage of visualization is its ability to graphically represent complex information, serving as a form of complexity reduction that enhances human comprehension. This can include large data sets that are easier for humans to understand visually, as certain data properties can only be discovered through visual means. Examples range from visual representations of business data used in statistics and data analytics to visualizations of medical data for discovering features in the human body, and visualizations of sensor data can be extrapolated to create animated weather maps. Visualization also includes visual representations of knowledge to facilitate human communication, such as in educational settings or complex project presentations, which, unlike data visualizations typically generated by algorithms, are created and curated manually by humans. Depending on the visualization's purpose, they may use formal or semi-formal languages common in conceptual modeling or consist of ad-hoc shapes and drawings, as found in infographics or structural legal visualizations, requiring a deep understanding of the domain and scenario, along with the skills to use the right tools and procedures. These tools range from drawing tools for creating arbitrary shapes or reusing existing ones to modeling tools that use predefined shapes and concepts, with more sophisticated tools existing for creating 3D representations, while standard drawing tools are user-friendly, modeling and specialized visualization tools often require significant training. The recent emergence of advanced large language models offers new ways to address this challenge, especially through coding in various languages. Large language models are trained on vast amounts of text, forming a probabilistic model of word sequences, with each word in the model's vocabulary assigned a probability based on given or generated sequences, and advances in science and technology have increased these models' training sets to hundreds of billions of parameters. In November 2022, OpenAI released a large language model as a dialogue system called ChatGPT, along with an API. The GPT language models are trained on over 175 billion parameters and can generate text in various styles and output programming code, and they may soon be able to process multimodal data, such as images. Recently, the application of these models has been explored in various domains to support text and code creation. We report on experiments using GPT-4 to create visualizations through prompts, exploring the potential for generating visualizations, particularly for structural legal visualizations in legal informatics. We seek to contribute to the discussion on how AI can support visualizations from a metaperspective, aiming to generate visualizations based on graphical primitives, such as vector graphics or programming code, contrasting with other approaches using models like DALL-E for pixel graphics.

It happened sometime in July or August when I tried something magical for the first time. This magical experience was due to consuming a few grams of Psilocybin mushrooms. It was nighttime when I gathered everything I needed to try them. I had planned to make a tea from the mushrooms, based on something I read on Reddit. The information suggested that boiling water and letting the mushrooms steep would remove alkaloids causing nausea, though it might weaken the effects. After brewing the tea, I decided to sit down and enjoy my freshly made magical drink. Halfway through the cup, I felt butterflies forming in my stomach. I attributed this feeling to my nerves, as I started to feel anxious about the situation. I had no idea what I should expect or how I would feel. I made the decision to lie down without finishing the tea. This was when the effects began to take hold, about 45 minutes after making the tea. Describing how I felt physically is challenging, but it seemed like I had no energy to get up. I felt as if I were glued to my bed, unable to move. Almost immediately, I became very introspective, reflecting on everything imaginable. I thought about times I got angry and moments when people did things for me. Thoughts about all my family members also crossed my mind. It was a truly remarkable experience, revealing that my perceived problems weren't really problems. I felt as if I had complete control over the world around me, feeling deeply connected to everything. All my everyday stresses vanished, replaced by an overwhelming sense of freedom. This intense experience brought tears to my eyes, and I couldn't stop crying tears of joy. I don't think I've ever felt so free and happy as I did at that moment. I remember telling myself to write down all these feelings, fearful of forgetting them. The next day, I felt an overwhelming glow and wanted to help everyone around me. This experience was incredibly memorable and brought a lot of happiness into my life."}}

When I discovered the wrong pills in a bottle, my supervisor was furious, even though I hadn't filled from that bottle all week. The incident was never mentioned again, leaving me sleepless, worrying if other mistakes had gone unnoticed. My job was crucial for my family\u2019s income and my self-worth, but I feared being held liable if something went wrong. The work environment was toxic, with an abusive supervisor notorious for her nastiness. My coworkers trained me through yelling and would argue about me in Spanish. Still, I persisted, determined not to let them win. Each day, I wished for a car accident severe enough to prevent me from working. I became irritable with my husband and child, and every moment outside of work was overshadowed by the dread of returning. My marriage suffered, and my self-esteem plummeted. Yet, I continued until one day, a single Tramadol tablet jolted me awake. A controlled substance had mistakenly been placed in a bottle of blood pressure medication, and no one noticed. The daily counts of controlled substances weren't off, which seemed suspicious. Was someone miscounting, or ignoring the issue to avoid paperwork? How often had this happened before, and why was I blamed? These questions haunted me until I realized I was sacrificing myself for a job that would discard me in a crisis. Fearing potential criminal charges for something I didn't do, I chose to quit. Now, we're relying on food banks and credit to get by, but I know I made the right choice."}}

Cutting the tongue is painful and frightening, so help the injured person relax. Staying calm while treating the injury is crucial for success. Wash your hands before assisting to reduce infection risk. Consider wearing medical gloves since blood can carry diseases. Sit up straight and tilt the head forward to let blood flow out, not down the throat. Swallowing blood can cause vomiting, so this position helps prevent it. Tongue cuts bleed heavily, but assess the injury's depth and size. Shallow cuts can be treated at home. Seek medical attention for deep wounds or those longer than \u00bd an inch. Professional care may be necessary for punctures or foreign objects. Use gauze or a clean cloth to apply pressure for fifteen minutes to stop bleeding. If gauze soaks through, add more without removing the original piece. Wrap an ice cube in a thin cloth to reduce flow, pain, and swelling. Hold it on the wound for up to three minutes. Repeat this up to ten times a day. Sucking on an ice cube or a popsicle can also help. Use ice only on the first day of injury. Ensure your hands and the cloth are clean. The day after, rinse your mouth with warm salt water up to six times daily. This keeps the wound clean. If teeth are unharmed, continue with regular dental hygiene. Avoid brushing or flossing injured teeth. Visit a dentist for dental injuries. Monitor the injury as it heals for any issues. Seek medical help if blood flow doesn't stop after ten minutes, if you develop a fever, or if the wound is painful or has pus. A cut tongue will be sore and sensitive. For a few days, change your diet to reduce discomfort and avoid further injury. Avoid hard foods; opt for soft ones. Steer clear of extremely hot or cold foods. Most tongue cuts heal without trouble. After first aid and care, simply wait for the injury to heal. Healing time depends on the injury's severity."}}

Thus, the quality of word vectors directly depends on the amount and quality of data they were trained on. A common source of data to learn word representations, available in numerous languages, is the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which offers high-quality data for many languages (Al-Rfou et al., 2013). Unfortunately, for many languages, the size of Wikipedia is relatively small and often insufficient to learn high-quality word vectors with comprehensive coverage. An alternative source of large-scale text data is the web and resources such as the Common Crawl, which provides a vast amount of data for many applications. Although the data from these sources is noisier than Wikipedia articles, it is available in larger quantities and offers broader coverage for various applications. In this work, we contribute high-quality word vectors trained on Wikipedia and the Common Crawl corpus. We collected large training corpora for 157 languages using Wikipedia and Common Crawl, as well as other sources. We describe in detail the procedure for splitting the data by language and pre-processing it in Section 2.
