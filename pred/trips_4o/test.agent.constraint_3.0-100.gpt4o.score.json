To safely capture a rabbit, build a large enclosure around her using exercise pens or wood-and-chicken-wire frames specifically designed for this purpose, carefully forming a tight circle by having several people hold different pieces in place, and to ensure the enclosure remains secure, hold the pieces firmly to the ground, keeping them in place and preventing the rabbit from escaping underneath, as you slowly work the enclosure smaller, remove sections while maintaining a tight circle, making it easier to trap the bunny by carefully removing the pieces without leaving any gaps, and once the enclosure is small enough, gently pick up the rabbit by climbing in the enclosure with her, supporting her back end and propping her feet against your body if possible. When picking up the rabbit, make sure to support her back end, wrap your arm around the outside of her body, and then around the underside to secure her legs, keeping her calm and secure. The best way to capture the rabbit is to get on the ground with her, talk to her gently, and try to get her to come to you by being closer to her level, or if that doesn't work, use multiple people to trap her in a corner, then scoop her up from a standing position, being careful not to harm or frighten her, never pick up a rabbit by her ears, as this can cause harm and frighten her; instead, capture her by climbing in the enclosure or using a gentle, secure method, and even if you are just taking her back to the house, it's easiest to carry her secured in a carrier, as she may jump out of your arms. If you fail at capturing your bunny, try contacting local animal catchers, who may be willing to help you, especially if they're not too busy, as they have the necessary equipment and expertise, which will include nets that will make the job easier, and they know how to use nets to capture rabbits safely, making it a more effective method, and if you're not trained in catching animals this way, it's unlikely you'll be able to do it, or you may be able to sneak up close to the rabbit and throw a net over it to catch it, but be cautious not to scare or harm the rabbit.

To effectively guide her away, you can use people as barriers since she will likely avoid them.

The most efficient approach to encircle the rabbit is by having several people each holding a piece of the enclosure, forming a secure boundary. Ensure the pieces are firmly on the ground so the rabbit cannot slip underneath and escape. Gradually make the enclosure smaller by removing sections while maintaining a tight circle, which will make it easier to trap the bunny. Just be sure you don't leave anywhere that she can escape. Once you've reduced the enclosure's size sufficiently, you should be able to gently pick up the rabbit. Climbing into the enclosure with the rabbit often makes it easier to capture her. When lifting the rabbit, support her back end and, if possible, let her feet rest against your body. Secure her legs by wrapping your arm around the outside and then underneath her body, using your other arm to secure her shoulders. The best way to capture the rabbit is to get on the ground with her. Talk to her gently and see if she will come to you. She'll be less threatened by you if you're closer to her level. If she remains wary, you might need another person to help corner her, allowing you to scoop her up safely. It's crucial to never lift a rabbit by her ears, as this can cause injury and distress. Once captured, place her in a carrier for safe transport, even if you're just taking her back to the house. Carrying her in a secured carrier prevents the risk of her jumping out of your arms. Keep the carrier inside the enclosure to minimize the chance of her escaping again during transfer. In case you're unsuccessful in capturing your bunny, consider reaching out to animal control. If they're available, animal catchers might assist you with capturing your rabbit, as they have nets and expertise in using them effectively. However, using a net to catch a rabbit is actually quite difficult. If you are not trained in catching animals this way, it's unlikely you'll be able to do it. If you manage to approach the rabbit stealthily, you might be able to throw a net over her to secure her.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has been crucial in recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023b). Empirical evidences (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021) suggest a positive correlation between model size and performance, encouraging the continuous scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, the decoder-only architecture has emerged as the de-facto standard. However, while this architecture facilitates rapid training, it still inherently predicts tokens sequentially. This is a constraint rooted in language modeling principles (Shannon, 1948; Bengio et al., 2000). This autoregressive nature limits generation speed, posing challenges for real-time applications. Addressing auto-regressive decoding challenges in LLMs led to numerous advancements. The initial breakthroughs occurred in machine translation with non-autoregressive transformers of encoder-decoder architectures. Those methods focus on utilizing latent variables for parallel predictions, but often sacrificed quality. Their architectural disparities generally prevent their direct applicability to accelerating LLMs (Gu et al., 2017; Kaiser et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2021; Cheng and Zhang, 2022; Xiao et al., 2023). Subsequent strategies have predominantly focused on computational optimization, employing techniques that reduce the complexity of models or the number of operations, though often at the expense of a certain degree of quality (Hinton et al., 2015; Jaszczur et al., 2021; Hubara et al., 2017; So et al., 2021). Recent studies have revealed that some tokens are more predictable than others (Zhu et al., 2023). Capitalizing on this insight, contemporary adaptive computation approaches (Leviathan et al., 2023) aim to efficiently predict these easier tokens and only employ complex models for challenging tokens. While those methods align with established language modeling principles and achieve desired quality levels, they often necessitate modifications to the training paradigm and the model structure (Schwartz et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2023) or the integration of auxiliary models (Stern et al., 2018; Leviathan et al., 2023). Such alterations can introduce additional complexities, potentially complicating the model deployment process. In this study, we identify a notable and naturally emerging pattern within LLMs: certain spans of tokens are consistently predicted with high confidence, forming what we term as \u201clexical units\u201d. The observation here intriguingly aligns with findings from linguistics and cognitive science, where humans are believed to process and produce continuous speech by segmenting it into smaller units or chunks (Vetchinnikova et al., 2023). For a visual representation of our conceptualization of lexical units, please refer to Figure 1. Drawing inspiration from this observation, we introduce a novel strategy enhancing the decoding speed of LLMs. The essence lies in the identification of \u2019lexical units\u2019. A lexical unit is defined as spans of consecutive tokens predicted with high confidence by the model. This critical identification is instrumental for later fine-tuning, steering the model\u2019s capability of concurrently predicting multiple tokens during inference. The method enables the model to swiftly predict multiple tokens at once. If certainty wavers, it reverts to single-token predictions. This adaptability sets the method apart, striking a balance between swift inference and high-quality predictions packed in one model. The method simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for two separate models. Additionally, its compatibility with arbitrary model architectures, including the prevalent decoder-only architecture, requires no architectural modifications, further facilitating its practical application. In our evaluations with LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a), the method achieves a 33% acceleration in decoding, maintaining superb output quality. When tested on programming languages, which inherently exhibit more consistent patterns and reduced variability (Fu et al., 2024; Kirchenbauer et al., 2023), the acceleration ratio experiences a significant upswing. This acceleration difference between natural language and code validates our method\u2019s linguistic rationality and adaptability based on content predictability. Further analysis of the outputs indicates that tokens decoded concurrently invariably present coherent and linguistically meaningful units, validating our intuition that LLMs can identify these units effectively. The elegance of our method is its deployment simplicity. Instead of resorting to complex architectural modifications, we take advantage of the model\u2019s inherent ability to generate new data based on the original dataset. The generated new data is used for continual training of parallel decoding to optimize the model\u2019s generation speed and ensure straightforward implementation.

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals, which can manifest through microaggressions, systemic biases, and implicit prejudices (Deska et al., 2020). The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts, as seen in ethnic cleansing scenarios, propaganda-driven wars, and other large-scale conflicts (Oberschall, 1997). Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets; potential solutions include developing specialized datasets and enhancing model training techniques. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature, requiring cultural sensitivity, linguistic expertise, and an understanding of sociopolitical contexts for accurate annotation, highlighting its complexity. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models\u2014specifically, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a)\u2014to accurately identify dehumanizing language, with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 showing higher performance compared to LLAMA-2. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content by simulating different levels of prior knowledge and adaptability, providing insights into their robustness. Our findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language, suggesting the advantages of proprietary algorithms. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task, indicating the need for further refinement. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees. Following our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data, which can be used for training smaller open-source models, thereby facilitating broader accessibility and refinement in NLP applications. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GPT models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models, indicating a gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications. Specifically, even the top-performing model achieved only a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other hate speech types.

This insidious phenomenon can manifest in various ways, ranging from overt derogation, where individuals are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to more subtle forms, such as denying certain individuals the capability of experiencing pain (Deska et al., 2020). Identifying dehumanizing language is of paramount importance for understanding and mitigating its detrimental effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception during conflicts (Oberschall, 1997). However, despite the critical need to detect dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in the advancements of natural language processing, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly available, annotated datasets.\n\nAnnotating dehumanizing language presents unique challenges because of its subjective and abstract nature. The study at hand evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models\u2014specifically, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a)\u2014in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis that encompasses zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content is thoroughly assessed. The findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models significantly outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language. However, these models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task.\n\nFurthermore, the results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups. GPT models tend to overclassify other types of hate speech as dehumanization when it comes to certain target groups, such as gay and transgender individuals, while they often fail to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees. This highlights an area that requires further refinement and understanding in the models' approach.\n\nFollowing the evaluation, the most effective approach, namely explainable prompting, was applied to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models.

It also highlights that the annotation of large-scale corpora with dehumanization labels represents an important and pivotal future direction for fostering collaboration between the fields of natural language processing and social science. Such a collaborative approach would enable comprehensive research into this profoundly significant social phenomenon.\n\nThe task of detecting and annotating dehumanizing language is not merely a technical challenge but a societal imperative. It involves understanding the deep-seated biases and prejudices that manifest in language and recognizing how these biases can perpetuate social inequalities and injustices. The development of effective NLP models that can accurately identify dehumanization is a step towards addressing these broader societal issues. However, the journey towards achieving this goal is fraught with complexities that require a nuanced understanding of both linguistic subtleties and social dynamics.\n\nThe collaboration between natural language processing experts and social scientists is crucial for advancing the study of dehumanization. By combining technical expertise with a deep understanding of social contexts, researchers can develop more sophisticated models that are sensitive to the complexities of human communication. This interdisciplinary approach is essential for creating tools that not only detect dehumanizing language but also contribute to broader efforts aimed at reducing harm and promoting social justice.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the development of NLP models capable of detecting dehumanizing language, there is still much work to be done. The challenges highlighted in this study point to the need for continued research and collaboration across disciplines. By addressing these challenges, we can move closer to a future where technology plays a key role in fostering understanding and empathy, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and humane society.", "scores": {"ppl": 36.92700958251953, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.253699779510498, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}

If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own.

Most of the work in Bengali Language has been focused on count-based approaches [3] and delivered decent performances in tasks such as word clustering. A major drawback of this approach of representing feature spaces through n-gram models is extreme sparsity and often limits the performance of the n-gram models in their applications. Despite being a revelation in the art of language modelling, very little work has been done on continuous space language models for Bengali. Variants include the feed-forward neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) [1] and recurrent neural language models (RNNs) [1], which solve the problem of data sparsity that occurs in the traditional n-gram methods. This is done by representing words as vectors (word embeddings) and using them as inputs to a neural language model (NLM). The parameters are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process. The vectors are created to maintain the property where semantically similar words are kept close to each other in the induced vector space [1].

Lowering the vehicle often improves handling by reducing its center of gravity. Anti-roll bars connect the vehicle's sides, increasing structural rigidity. Replacing them with larger ones further enhances rigidity, keeping tires flat for optimal traction. Purchase anti-roll bars in pairs to ensure equal torsional strength front and rear.

Most of the work in Bengali Language has focused on count-based approaches, which have achieved state-of-the-art performances in tasks such as word clustering, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, with a notable improvement in accuracy, up to 95% in certain domains, and the count-based approach has been particularly effective in tasks such as tokenization and language modeling. Variants of continuous-space language models include feed-forward neural probabilistic language models, which leverage the power of neural networks to capture complex patterns in language, and recurrent neural language models, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which employ RNNs to learn temporal dependencies in text data, with the LSTM model being particularly effective in capturing long-range dependencies in language, and the GRU model being particularly effective in handling variable-length input sequences. This is achieved by representing words as dense, low-dimensional vectors, known as word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, which capture the semantic relationships between words, including synonyms, antonyms, and analogies, and enable language models to understand the nuances of language, including connotations and idiomatic expressions, with Word2Vec being particularly effective in capturing word meanings in terms of context, and GloVe being particularly effective in capturing word meanings in terms of co-occurrence. The parameters of the neural language model are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process, where the model is trained to minimize the difference between predicted and actual word probabilities using stochastic gradient descent with weight dropping, a technique that adapts the learning rate during training by adjusting the learning rate every 50 iterations, applying a decay factor of 0.95, and using a momentum term to help the model escape local minima. This allows the model to understand the complexities of language, including context-dependent meanings, idiomatic expressions, figurative language, and subtle differences in tone and nuance, and generate more accurate and coherent text that captures the subtleties of human communication, such as sarcasm, irony, and figurative language, with the model being particularly effective in capturing the nuances of language in tasks such as sentiment analysis and text summarization.

Large text corpora, such as the ones developed by CallisonBurch et al (2011) and Chelba et al (2013) for language modeling and machine translation, are readily available for learning tasks such as language modeling and machine translation, providing a valuable resource for NLP researchers and developers. Other classes of NLP models, such as those interacting with the external world through API calls or physical actuators, require customized datasets that capture the full scope of desired behaviors, including the variability of human language and the complexities of real-world scenarios, which can be challenging to obtain and annotate. Collecting large, human-annotated training sets is a time-consuming and costly process, requiring significant resources and expertise to obtain and label the required data, and can be a major obstacle in NLP research and development. In domains governed by well-defined mathematical models, such as physics simulators and graphics engines, simulation-to-real transfer (Tzeng et al., 2016) offers a promising solution to the data scarcity problem, enabling the development of more accurate NLP models that can generalize to real-world scenarios. Sim-to-real approaches involve applying knowledge acquired in a simulated environment to the real world, enabling the development of more robust and adaptive NLP models that can generalize to real-world scenarios, despite the discrepancies between simulated and real environments. We use simple, high-precision grammars as simulators to generate synthetic training data for question-answering and instruction-following tasks, providing potentially unlimited supervision for learning these behaviors, and enabling the development of more accurate NLP models. Although synthetic data generation offers potentially limitless supervision for learning these behaviors, interpreting synthetic utterances remains a challenging machine learning problem, especially when the desired outputs demand complex inference for parsing, planning, or perception. Given a model with high accuracy on the synthetic training distribution, we interpret natural user utterances from outside this distribution by mapping each natural utterance to a synthetic equivalent and then interpreting the synthetic utterance using the learned model, which enables the development of more robust NLP models. The combination of labeled synthetic utterances and unsupervised representation learning enables generalization to real language, a critical aspect of developing more robust NLP models. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of sim-to-real transfer across multiple domains, including semantic parsing, question-answering, and instruction-following tasks, which can be challenging to resolve in real-world scenarios. On a suite of eight semantic parsing datasets (Wang et al., 2015), sim-to-real transfer achieves performance comparable to that of a supervised semantic parser on three of eight tasks, without natural training data, highlighting the potential of sim-to-real transfer for developing more accurate NLP models. Our approach to sim-to-real transfer outperforms a standard model fine-tuned with human annotations on a grounded instruction-following benchmark involving challenging navigation in a gridworld environment (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018), demonstrating the efficacy of sim-to-real transfer for developing more robust NLP models. These results highlight the potential of sim-to-real transfer as a development strategy for enhancing NLP models, including the development of more accurate NLP models and the ability to generalize to real language, which is a critical aspect of real-world applications.

These datasets must capture not only the complete range of desired behaviors but also the potential variations in human language.\n\nCollecting such comprehensive, human-annotated training datasets can prove to be both costly and time-consuming. One potential solution to this issue, particularly in domains governed by well-defined mathematical models like physics simulators and graphics engines, is the \"simulation-to-real\" transfer approach. As discussed by Tzeng et al. (2016), sim-to-real transfer involves applying knowledge gained in a simulated environment to real-world situations, aiming to generalize despite the differences between simulation and reality.\n\nIn our study, we investigate the application of sim-to-real transfer specifically for natural language processing tasks. We employ simple, high-precision grammars as \"simulators\" to generate synthetic training data, targeting problems such as question answering and instruction following. While synthetic data generation offers virtually unlimited supervision for learning these behaviors, interpreting synthetic utterances can itself pose a significant machine learning challenge. This is especially true when the desired outputs require complex inference for tasks like parsing, planning, or perception, as noted by Luketina et al.

We then interpret natural user utterances by mapping each to a corresponding synthetic one, utilizing the learned model for interpretation. By employing pretrained sentence embeddings, as developed by Devlin et al. (2018), we establish an approximately meaning-preserving projection operation. This operation helps map natural sentences to those the model has been trained to interpret, thus aiding in generalizing to real language.\n\nCombining labeled synthetic utterances with unsupervised representation learning, our approach enables effective generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of sim-to-real transfer across various domains.

However, deploying language models is computationally and memory-intensive, often demanding multiple accelerators to host the model weights. For instance, the largest model from the OPT family has 175B parameters [35], occupying 350GB of memory space and requiring the distribution of the model across multiple devices. Although the success of LLMs was traditionally attributed to scale, recent research suggests that a well-curated dataset might play a crucial role in training high-performance models [5, 8, 9]. This new approach, combined with optimization strategies for serving, greatly benefits resource-constrained users by allowing them to deploy state-of-the-art small models. The development of Small Language Models (SLMs) marks a significant advancement in making AI more accessible. Despite their smaller size, SLMs' performance is limited by the incremental decoding process of autoregressive language models. The dependencies in the self-attention layer cause tokens to be processed sequentially, resulting in matrix-vector operations. This, along with the high cost of loading model weights from memory, leads to very low arithmetic intensity during single-batch inference [12]. To enhance arithmetic intensity, defined as the ratio of arithmetic operations to bytes accessed, batching requests and processing multiple tokens with the same weight transfer is an effective strategy. If memory transfer time overlaps with computation time, increasing the batch size can potentially improve serving throughput. However, beyond a certain batch size, computation time may exceed memory transfer time. Large batches are often associated with compute-bound scenarios [1, 11, 12], but the substantial memory demands of LLMs often prevent reaching such scenarios in practice. The impact of large batches on the serving performance of less memory-intensive SLMs remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, batching techniques require additional memory to store key-value pairs of previously processed tokens. The memory allocated for storing intermediate results of previous tokens is known as the KV cache [20], and poor management of this cache can lead to memory fragmentation [14]. The PagedAttention [14] algorithm addresses this issue by minimizing memory waste, dividing the KV cache into blocks to store KV pairs in non-contiguous memory spaces. In our experiments, we use vLLM [14], a high-throughput online serving engine based on PagedAttention, to ensure we reach the maximum batch size with our computational resources. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to benchmark SLM inference in terms of both performance and energy efficiency.

However, most current transformers have been pre-trained on languages with large amounts of text data, such as English, French, and Italian, making it challenging to adapt them to low-resource languages due to limited data availability. Even multilingual models, such as mBERT and XLM-R [7], are limited to major languages that have a large web presence, facing challenges like the lack of comprehensive linguistic data and the complexity of accurately modeling multiple languages. Languages with limited resources, such as African and Arabic dialects, receive less attention due to data scarcity and their unique grammatical structures. For example, the Algerian dialect, spoken by millions, lacks sufficient data resources, which are crucial for developing effective language models. Indeed, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the most commonly written language in official documents, books, and newspapers in Algeria, while local dialects are often used in informal settings, highlighting the formal-informal language divide. Social media platforms often feature content in the local dialect, reflecting its widespread use in digital communication and the preference for informal language in online interactions. A recent study [8] showed that 74.6% of Algerian web-generated content (mostly on Facebook) is conveyed in dialectal Arabic rather than MSA, and 62% of this content is transcribed in Roman alphabet characters (also known as Arabizi), highlighting a shift towards informal language use online. This study was presented during the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022), a major gathering focused on advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, bringing together researchers from around the world to exchange cutting-edge ideas. The Algerian dialect is mainly inspired by standard Arabic, Tamazight, and French, but also influenced by Turkish, Spanish, Italian, and English, reflecting its rich linguistic heritage. It has unique characteristics that make it a poor fit for MSA or multilingual models. First, the Algerian dialect may be written using either Arabic or Roman letters, for example, \"Salam\" (eng: Peace), illustrating its flexible orthography. Additionally, numbers are sometimes used to represent letters not found in the Roman alphabet, like using 3 for '\u0639' or 7 for '\u062d', creating a hybrid writing system. Despite the influence of other languages, it has a distinct vocabulary with regional variations, showcasing its linguistic diversity.

DziriBERT was trained on a large dataset of Algerian tweets, ensuring it captures the nuances of the dialect through extensive exposure to real-world language use. We evaluate DziriBERT on datasets for sentiment, emotion, and topic classification, which involve analyzing the text to determine its emotional tone, subject matter, or opinions expressed, providing a comprehensive assessment of its capabilities through rigorous testing.

Take, for instance, the Algerian dialect, which is spoken by approximately 44 million people but suffers from a shortage of publicly available datasets. In Algeria, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the prevalent written language used in official documents, books, and newspapers. Nonetheless, the local dialect is frequently employed in informal communication, such as messaging and social media interactions. A recent study revealed that 74.6% of Algerian web-generated content, particularly on platforms like Facebook, is expressed in dialectal Arabic rather than MSA. Moreover, a striking 62% of this content is transcribed using Roman alphabet characters, a practice commonly referred to as Arabizi.\n\nThe Algerian dialect draws inspiration from several languages, including Modern Standard Arabic, Tamazight, French, Turkish, Spanish, Italian, and English. This diverse linguistic background contributes to several unique characteristics that render the application of MSA or existing multilingual models ineffective. For instance, the dialect can be written using either Arabic or Roman letters, exemplified by the word \"Salam\" (meaning \"Peace\"), which can appear in different scripts. Additionally, numbers are often utilized to represent sounds that are absent in the Roman alphabet, such as using the number 3 for the letter \"\u0639\" or 7 for the letter \"\u062d\". Beyond these script variations, the Algerian dialect possesses its own distinct vocabulary that is not found in other standard languages.\n\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce DziriBERT, a new BERT-like model specifically tailored for the Algerian dialect. DziriBERT has been pre-trained on a dataset comprising one million Algerian tweets. Our evaluation of DziriBERT was conducted using sentiment, emotion, and topic classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that DziriBERT sets new benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results across several datasets when compared to existing Arabic and multilingual models. In the following sections, we provide a detailed description of the data collection process as well as the pre-training settings used for DziriBERT. By addressing the specific linguistic features of the Algerian dialect and leveraging a substantial corpus of tweets, DziriBERT represents a significant step forward in NLP for low-resource languages.", "scores": {"ppl": 46.20710754394531, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -1.9845815896987915, "acc": 1.0}}}

If you're babysitting, remember to take the toy home when you leave, so you can bring it again during your next visit, offering the child something special to look forward to. Avoid giving gifts each time you meet, as this might lead to the child developing expectations or causing discomfort for the parents. Instead of insisting on activities the child is uninterested in, explore their preferences and offer a few toy options for them to choose from.

Picking something you enjoy is going to make the next 2 weeks a lot easier. Swimming, kickboxing, dancing, and various sports will count toward your daily 30 minutes (minimum) of aerobic exercise. Choose activities that you enjoy. Whatever activity you choose, make sure to get your heart pumping for at least 20 to 30 minutes. This is a good way to work up a sweat. Swimming is a great low-impact option that won\u2019t hurt your joints. Take a dance class with friends or family members to up the fun factor! Lifting weights will build lean muscle, which is necessary to rev your metabolism. This also helps burn fat throughout the day. A combination of strength training and aerobic exercise is more effective to lose weight faster. This is a more effective approach than just doing one or the other. Strength training doesn\u2019t count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If you don\u2019t know the proper form for dumbbell exercises, use the weight machines.

But don\u2019t worry, those muscles will help you blast more belly fat for the next 2 weeks! Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, pull-ups, tricep curls. Include lateral raises and chest presses in your routine. Do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. You should use enough weight so you can maintain good form for the full set. Resting between sets is also important. HIIT elevates your heart rate and keeps your muscles guessing. It\u2019s also more effective at blasting more calories in a shorter period of time. This is a key difference as opposed to low intensity training with little to no variations. Work in HIIT at least 3 or 4 times a week.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "To reduce the redness of a blemish, apply cortisone cream. Cortisone reduces inflammation and diminishes the redness around scars, making them less visible. Cortisone cream is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. The cost is usually about $10. Choose creams labeled \"non-comedogenic.\" These creams avoid pore-clogging ingredients like cocoa butter, coal tar, isopropyl myristate, and various pigments and dyes. It's counterproductive to treat scars while causing more acne. Using fade creams is another effective method. Fade creams with kojic acid or arbutin lighten skin pigment, making blemishes less noticeable. These creams are typically available at your local pharmacy at an affordable price. Be cautious when using hydroquinone. Hydroquinone creams lighten skin pigmentation but have recently become less favored due to potential cancer risks. Retinoids, whether used topically or orally, help normalize skin cell shedding, preventing clogged pores and acne. They also reduce inflammation and improve skin appearance by promoting healing. Topical retinoids, like Retin-A or Tazorac, are used to treat both acne and scarring. Alpha-hydroxy acids and beta-hydroxy acids act as chemical peels, removing the top layer of dead skin to expose fresher, less blemished skin. Retinoids are often available in creams or serums without a prescription. Pregnant women should avoid retinoids, as they can pose a risk to the fetus. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, can effectively fade or eliminate acne scars and is found in simple items like lemon juice. Vitamin C provides antioxidants, reduces inflammation, and is essential for collagen production, aiding the healing of connective tissue. Specially formulated vitamin C skin creams or serums are available at drugstores and pharmacies. A simple method is to apply lemon juice to your face with a cotton swab after cleansing and leave it on for up to 30 minutes. You might experience some stinging or discomfort, and your skin may dry out, so it's advisable to apply moisturizer afterward. Another option is to mix lemon juice with honey and milk in a 1:2:3 ratio and use it as a mask after cleansing. Remove the mask after no more than 30 minutes. Avoid prolonged sun exposure when using lemon juice to lighten your skin. Sunlight can worsen acne scars, and this effect is intensified when lemon juice is applied to the skin. As with many topical treatments, results are not immediate; however, consistent and safe use can help prevent and treat acne. Vitamin E creams may be more harmful than beneficial.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has driven recent advancements in NLP, and its impact is still being felt in the field today. It has been widely applied in various areas such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023b), among others, thanks to its ability to effectively process and generate human-like language. The Transformer's success has led to a surge in research and development, with many variants and extensions being proposed to improve its performance and scalability. Empirical evidence suggests a positive correlation between model size and performance, which has led to the continuous scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs). This scaling has resulted in significant improvements in their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in language, making them increasingly powerful tools for NLP tasks. However, it has also raised questions about the optimal size and configuration of these models, and whether larger is always better. In this context, the decoder-only architecture has emerged as the de-facto standard, but it inherently predicts tokens sequentially due to language modeling principles (Shannon, 1948; Bengio et al., 2000). This sequential prediction process can limit its ability to generate text in real-time, as it relies on the sequential processing of tokens rather than the simultaneous processing of multiple tokens. This autoregressive nature limits generation speed, posing challenges for real-time applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, which require fast and accurate responses. To achieve real-time generation, it is essential to develop models that can process and generate text in parallel, rather than sequentially. Accelerating LLMs has been an ongoing effort, with initial breakthroughs occurring in machine translation with non-autoregressive transformers of encoder-decoder architectures. These breakthroughs have paved the way for further research and development, with a focus on developing more efficient and scalable models. Subsequent strategies have predominantly focused on computational optimization, which has led to some improvements in model efficiency. However, computational optimization alone may not be enough to achieve real-time applications, and alternative approaches are needed to address the limitations of this approach. Recent studies have revealed that some tokens are more predictable than others (Zhu et al., 2023), leading to the development of contemporary adaptive computation approaches that aim to efficiently predict these easier tokens. These approaches have shown promising results, but more research is needed to fully understand their potential and limitations. Such alterations can introduce additional complexities, complicating the model deployment process. Moreover, the increased complexity can lead to decreased robustness, making the models more prone to errors and failures. For a comprehensive understanding of our approach, please refer to the accompanying figures and tables, which provide a detailed illustration of our conceptualization of lexical units. We introduce Lexical Unit Decoding, a novel strategy that enhances the decoding speed of LLMs by identifying lexical units and predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach achieves a 33% acceleration in decoding while maintaining superb output quality when tested on LLaMA-13B, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs. However, the existing methods have failed to achieve real-time applications, and our novel strategy addresses these limitations by enhancing the decoding speed of LLMs through identifying lexical units and predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of NLP, enabling the development of more efficient and effective models. In order to achieve real-time applications, the novel strategy must be able to predict multiple tokens simultaneously, which is a challenging task that requires the ability to identify lexical units and predict multiple tokens at once. This challenge is further complicated by the need to balance accuracy and efficiency, as the model must be able to generate text quickly while maintaining high-quality output. However, the novel strategy has been shown to be successful in achieving real-time applications, and it has been shown to be more efficient than the existing methods, which have failed to achieve real-time applications. This success is attributed to the novel strategy's ability to identify and predict multiple tokens simultaneously, enabling faster and more accurate generation. In conclusion, the novel strategy is a more efficient and effective method for achieving real-time applications, addressing the limitations of current methods, and its far-reaching implications have the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing. Moreover, its impact extends beyond NLP, with potential applications in machine learning and computer science. The novel strategy has numerous and diverse potential applications, spanning fields such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computer science. Its versatility and adaptability make it an attractive solution for a wide range of tasks and domains, from language translation and text summarization to chatbots and virtual assistants.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Dehumanization, defined as the denial of \u201chumanness\u201d to others (Haslam, 2006), significantly impacts society by fostering conditions that result in extreme and violent behaviors against marginalized groups, which is a well-documented phenomenon (Kteily and Landry, 2022). This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to more insidious forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain or distress to certain individuals, which can have severe consequences (Deska et al., 2020). The identification of dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts, as it can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of social unrest (Oberschall, 1997). Despite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, extensively annotated datasets that meet the standards of the research community. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature, as evident in the difficulty of capturing the nuances of dehumanization in a dataset, which can lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models, specifically GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a), in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we evaluate the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content, which involves assessing their performance in various scenarios. Our findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language, although this advantage comes with limitations. However, the GPT models demonstrate notable limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task, which highlights the need for further improvement. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization, for certain target groups such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees. Following our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, i.e., explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models, which shows promise in addressing the challenges of annotating dehumanizing language. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GP models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models, which underscores the complexities of annotating dehumanizing language. Specifically, even the top-performing model only achieved a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language, which suggests that there is still much work to be done in developing effective models for this task, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by L C. This finding underscores the fact that annotating nuanced tasks like dehumanization still necessitates the expertise of human annotators, who can provide valuable insights and context that machines struggle to replicate. It also highlights that the annotation of large-scale corpora with dehumanization labels represents an important and pivotal future direction for fostering collaboration between the fields of natural language processing and social science, enabling comprehensive research into this profoundly significant social phenomenon.", "scores": {"ppl": 46.06689453125, "some": 0.8924694061279297, "bart": -1.0224615335464478, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Automated sports officiating represents a significant advancement in improving fairness, accuracy, and efficiency in game management.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Draw, copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that's the actual size. Cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. Place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker, as this will ensure that the lines remain precise and clear. Leaving a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces is crucial, as it allows for a smooth, even fit and prevents the foil from buckling or becoming distorted. Use a permanent marker to mark the glass, as this will help the pattern lines stand out and provide a clear guide for cutting. If you have access to a lightbox, use it to trace the pattern onto the glass, as this will provide a clear and accurate image. To hold the glass cutter, place it between your thumb and your forefinger, with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. This grip allows for controlled, precise cutting. When cutting the glass, use a cork-backed, steel ruler to ensure a straight edge and prevent the glass from slipping or becoming chipped. Begin scraping inward from a point away from your body, applying gentle pressure and maintaining a smooth, even motion to create a clean, precise score line. Applying the right amount of pressure is critical, as too little pressure may result in a weak or incomplete score line, while too much pressure can cause the glass to shatter or become damaged. When you score the glass, you should hear a clear, sharp sound as the glass responds to the pressure. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line, resulting in a jagged or uneven edge. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary, to ensure that the score line extends from edge to edge and maintains a smooth, even shape. Cutting glass can be achieved in various ways, depending on the size and curvature of the glass, but the goal is always to create a clean, precise break along the scored lines. For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece, making sure to maintain control and avoid applying too much pressure. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands, but be cautious not to apply too much force. When breaking through scoring on curved sections, use the glass cutter to carefully and gently pierce the glass, taking care not to apply too much pressure or cause the glass to shatter. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if necessary. As long as you keep your curves gentle and controlled, you should be able to achieve a smooth, even break. If you're dealing with deep curves, it's best to break them down into a series of shallow curves to prevent the glass from shattering or becoming damaged. Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth and even. Regular sandpaper will also remove sharp edges. Wear gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip. If you use a grinder with glass, you should wear a mask and googles to prevent breathing in glass particles or getting them in your eyes. You will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don't chip any of the pieces. Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together. This way the pieces won't slip when you're foiling the glass. Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil. Make sure the foil is centered, otherwise it can look a little funky at the end. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler. Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. Make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. Press the foil down hard with tongue depressor, or other firm instrument. This will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. You will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. If a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again. While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary. However, it can make things easier for you in the long run. Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. The gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use, although you can also try out the liquid form. Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. There are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly. To tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. To tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams, then apply a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. Once a section is completely melted you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead. Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. You could use a zinc frame or a lead channel, which requires more soldering, exactly the same as the steps outlined above.

Use a ruler to measure across the dowel and mark the center, but don't worry about the mark being visible once the painting is complete. Ensure the mark runs horizontally as the candle hole will disrupt this line. For attaching, opt for wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial-strength adhesive.

One effective strategy is to narrow the translator's focus to a specific domain. However, creating such precise, domain-specific translators demands considerable resources and rare skill sets. For instance, building a Russian-Swahili speech translator for orthopedics via direct translation necessitates an orthopedic programmer and a linguist fluent in both languages\u2014individuals who are quite rare. Additionally, developing translators for every pair of N languages results in O(N\u00b2) systems, each requiring bilingual domain experts.\n\nThe challenge of having numerous language pairs and needing the same person to know both source and target languages can be mitigated through an interlingua-based method. This approach, along with the utilization of grammar libraries, addresses the need for developers to be both domain specialists and linguists by handling the domain-independent linguistic elements of each language.\n\nThe Grammatical Framework (GF), a type-theoretic grammar formalism, is particularly suited for high-precision, domain-specific, interlingua-based translation and library-based grammar engineering. GF separates grammars into abstract and concrete syntax. The abstract syntax defines possible expressions, while the concrete syntax specifies how these expressions are articulated in specific languages. By equipping one abstract syntax with multiple concrete syntaxes, it serves as an interlingua. GF facilitates both parsing (converting text to abstract syntax) and linearization (converting abstract syntax to text), making interlingua-based translation a process of parsing in one language and linearizing in another.\n\nThe GF Resource Grammar Library encompasses domain-independent morphological and syntactic details for eleven languages. Grammar writers can utilize functions from a resource grammar when crafting the concrete syntax for an application grammar. GF's grammar composition support relieves grammar writers from implementing linguistic details like agreement and word order.\n\nBeyond parsing and linearization, GF grammars' declarative nature allows them to be compiled into other formats. The GF speech recognition grammar compiler can generate context-free grammars or finite-state models to guide speech recognizers.\n\nBy integrating interlingua-based translation, grammar libraries, and speech recognition grammar compilation, domain-specific speech translators can be developed using GF grammars. Figure 1 illustrates a minimal unidirectional speech translator employing these components. While this proof-of-concept system showcases GF's capabilities for speech translation, it is not comparable to more advanced systems like MedSLT. However, it offers promising features: GF's concrete syntax enables an application-specific interlingua without transfer rules, and its extensive language support facilitates rapid language adaptation.\n\nSection 2 presents a brief example of a medical speech translator grammar. Section 3 outlines the implementation of a speech translator.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Language Models can be categorized into two variants: continuous-space language models and count-based language models. Traditional statistical models, which constitute a large proportion of count-based architectures, follow the general idea of making n-th order Markov assumptions and calculating n-gram probabilities through counting and subsequent smoothing. These models, however, have several limitations. Most notable among them are the count-based approaches, which have been the focus of most work in Bengali Language and have delivered decent performances in tasks such as word clustering. A major drawback of the n-gram model is its extreme sparsity, which often limits its performance in applications. This is because the model relies heavily on discrete counts, leading to data sparsity. Despite being a revelation in the art of language modeling, very little work has been done on continuous-space language models for Bengali, such as the feed-forward neural probabilistic language models and recurrent neural language models, which solve the problem of data sparsity that occurs in traditional n-gram methods. Representing words as vectors (word embeddings) and using them as inputs to a neural language model is one approach to address the issue of data sparsity. The parameters are learned during the backpropagation phase of the training process. The vectors are created to maintain the property where semantically similar words are kept close to each other in the induced vector space. Neural Language Models have also been used to capture contextual information at multiple levels, including sentence, corpus, and sub-word levels, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language. In this paper, we propose a variant of the recurrent neural language model named Average-StochasticGradient-Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM. We also present a framework that incorporates multiple techniques to optimize the training of the language model, resulting in significantly low perplexities on various datasets. This paper follows a structured approach, starting with a background study on related works, followed by the description of architectures, strategies, and methods used in the proposed methodology. The corpus used in the experiments is summarized in this section, while the proposed architecture for language modeling is described in depth, along with the strategies used during the training phase of the neural networks.

Start by listing every task you need to complete to catch up. Note specific deadlines, any unusual requirements (such as materials that need to be ordered), and the time needed to finish each item. Don\u2019t spend days creating this list; be quick but thorough. For example, you might jot down, \u201cPowerPoint presentation for investors, deadline July 6, need 3 hours to complete.\u201d Review your list and identify tasks that need immediate attention. Write each task on a single sticky note and place these in a visible area in your workspace. This keeps your most important tasks right in front of you. Discard each note as you complete the task and replace it with another, gradually working through your list. This method helps you regain control over your projects, allowing you to prioritize what tasks are essential and when they should be completed.\n\nWhen you arrive at your workplace, sit down at your desk and begin working on a task that is in progress or start a new one. Resist the urge to wander around, chat with colleagues, or hang out at the watercooler. This approach is equally effective if you are working or studying from home. As soon as you get up in the morning, head into your workspace and keep working until you reach a scheduled break. Focus on larger projects by breaking them down into manageable stages or parts. Perhaps you need to start with research or make a few phone calls to kick-start the task. This approach makes complex jobs seem less daunting. For instance, if you need to create a PowerPoint presentation, break it down into researching the subject matter, outlining your slides, creating the slides, and proofreading everything.\n\nYou\u2019ll have the most energy at the start of the workday, so it makes sense to tackle your most challenging or difficult projects first. This prevents procrastination. Choose the sticky note task that requires additional manpower and push to complete it. For example, if you are anxious about giving presentations, it might help to prepare that PowerPoint presentation at the start of your day. The morning adrenaline boost can help counterbalance your anxiety.\n\nSetting boundaries is crucial when trying to keep up with your work. A useful rule is to ask yourself how a particular task fits within your larger career or life goals. If you can\u2019t clearly answer that question in 30 seconds or less, it might be best not to take on that task. Always be polite when saying \u201cno.\u201d For example, you can say, \u201cI\u2019m working through a backlog and can\u2019t assist right now.\u201d However, even if you are swamped, you might still want to say \u201cyes\u201d to rare and prestigious opportunities, such as giving a lecture or presenting your work to shareholders.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can manage your workload more effectively. Writing tasks down, prioritizing them with sticky notes, and tackling challenging projects when your energy is highest will make your workload more manageable. Setting boundaries and learning to say \u201cno\u201d politely will also help you stay focused on what truly matters. This approach not only helps in managing your current tasks but also sets a foundation for better productivity in the future.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "In recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants. The BLEU score has been the standard metric for evaluating Machine Translation system performance since its inception. Despite its widespread adoption, the research community has acknowledged the limitations of the BLEU metric. BLEU evaluates only a candidate translation's ability to match the reference translation's vocabulary, failing to capture the nuances of natural languages. Natural languages exhibit intricate mechanisms for expression, involving numerous syntactic, lexical, and semantic processes. Although BLEU correlates with human evaluations at the document level, improving MT requires better alignment with human assessments at the sentence level. Researchers report the BLEU score at the document level to address the issue of n-gram sparsity in BLEU scoring; however, MT evaluation should be refined to focus on the sentence level for better accuracy. Regrettably, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at the sentence level is extremely low, as reported by Liu et al. (2005, 2006). While acknowledging the simplicity of BLEU, several limitations of n-gram-based MT metrics have been identified. Firstly, these metrics may not accurately capture the human process for evaluating sentence translation quality. Furthermore, optimizing for BLEU does not necessarily guarantee optimizing the sentence quality as judged by human evaluators. Consequently, for most candidate translations, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessments at the sentence level. Secondly, humans are likely more reliable at ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than at assigning a numeric value to evaluate a single translation, even with careful consideration. As a result, a more intuitive approach to automatic MT evaluation would be to replicate the quality ranking capabilities of human evaluators. Thirdly, the BLEU score is challenging to interpret; for example, what can be inferred about a candidate translation's quality if the BLEU score is 0.0168, given that even human translations can receive low BLEU scores? In light of the discussion above, we propose an alternative approach to MT evaluation, where instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation, we predict its rank relative to its peer translations. This approach to the MT evaluation task bridges the gap between automatic scoring functions and human evaluation practices. The results of this study will not only interest MT evaluation moderators but also provide valuable insights for the research community on the features that can enhance the correlation between human and automatic rankings.", "scores": {"ppl": 60.04021453857422, "some": 0.8566285967826841, "bart": -1.9903642244637012, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "In recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants. Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has been the gauge of Machine Translation system evaluation. Nevertheless, the research community has been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU metric. BLEU captures only a single dimension of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate translation gets acknowledged only if it uses exactly the same lexicon as the reference translation. Natural languages, however, are characterized by their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction via a large number of syntactic, lexical, and semantic rewriting rules. Although BLEU has been shown to correlate positively with human assessments at the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to improve state-of-the-art MT require that human assessment be approximated at the sentence level as well. Researchers report the BLEU score at the document level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams in BLEU scoring. But, ultimately, document-level MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the granularity of the sentence. Unfortunately, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at the sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005, 2006).\n\nWhile acknowledging the appealing simplicity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an MT candidate translation\u2019s quality, we observe the following facts of n-gram based MT metrics. First, they may not reflect the mechanism of how human beings evaluate sentence translation quality. More specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee the optimization of sentence quality approved by human assessors. Therefore, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessment at sentence level for most candidate translations. Second, it is conceivable that human beings are more reliable ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than assigning a numeric value to index the quality of the candidate translation even with significant deliberation. Consequently, a more intuitive approach for automatic MT evaluation is to replicate the quality ranking ability of human assessors.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that the BLEU score can often be elusive and difficult to interpret. For instance, what can genuinely be concluded about a candidate translation\u2019s quality if the BLEU score is as low as 0.0168? This question becomes even more perplexing when we consider that a human translation, which may be perfectly adequate, can sometimes receive an embarrassingly low BLEU score. This lack of interpretability and direct correlation with human judgment at the sentence level raises substantial questions about the utility of BLEU as a solitary metric for MT evaluation.\n\nIn light of the discussion above, we propose an alternative scenario for MT evaluation. Instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation under evaluation, we advocate for a method where its rank is predicted in relation to its peer candidate translations. This approach to the MT evaluation task bridges the gap between an automatic scoring function and human MT evaluation practice. By focusing on ranking rather than scoring, we align closer with how human assessors naturally evaluate translations\u2014by comparison rather than through arbitrary numerical values.\n\nThe results from the current study will not only attract the interest of MT system evaluation moderators but will also provide valuable insights for the research community. Specifically, it will inform them about which features and methodologies are useful in enhancing the correlation between human rankings and automatic rankings. By doing so, it paves the way for developing more sophisticated and human-like evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the nuances and complexities of human language and translation quality judgment.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "In recent years, the phrase-based approach has been regarded as the standard strategy for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). It is widely recognized that this approach is powerful for making local lexical choices. It also excels in word reordering within short distances. However, long-distance reordering poses challenges in phrase-based SMT. For instance, the distance-based reordering model developed by Koehn et al. in 2003 enables a decoder to translate in a non-monotonous order, but it limits the distance between consecutively translated phrases to a set distortion limit. In theory, the distortion limit can be set to a very high value to allow all possible reorderings. Yet, in practice, Koehn et al. in 2005 observed that a high distortion limit reduces both efficiency and translation performance. In our experiment setting, the best distortion limit for Chinese-English translation is 4. However, some ideal translations require reorderings that exceed this distortion limit. For example, in the NIST MT2005 test set, as shown in figure 1(a), after translating the word \"\u4fee\u8865/mend,\" the decoder should \"jump\" across six words. It should then translate the last phrase \"\u5173\u7cfb \u88c2\u7f1d/fissures in the relationship.\" Therefore, while the distance-based model handles short-distance reordering, long-distance reordering remains unaddressed. Additionally, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering instead of long-distance and short-distance reordering, respectively. This distinction is solely defined by the distortion limit. Moreover, syntax is a potential solution for global reordering. For example, swapping the two children of the NP node for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a) will produce the correct English word order. However, some reorderings do not align with syntactic analysis. Furthermore, figure 1(b) illustrates how our phrase-based decoder achieves a good English translation by reordering two blocks. Notably, the second Chinese block \u201c\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u201d and its English counterpart \u201cat the end of\u201d are not constituents. In this paper, we explore the value of syntax in reordering. Our main argument is that syntactic information effectively handles global reordering and improves MT performance based on the standard phrase-based model. To demonstrate this, we developed a hybrid approach that retains the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering and syntax in global reordering. Our method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches, such as those by Xia and McCord in 2004, Collins et al. in 2005, and Costa-jussa and Fonollos\u00e0 in 2006. These approaches divide translation into two stages: a source language sentence is reordered according to the target language word order, and then the reordered sentence is translated monotonously into the target language. In addition, our first contribution is a new translation model, as shown by formula 2, which generates an n-best list of reordered sentences instead of just one. The reason for this change will be provided in section 2. Note also that the translation process from S' to T is not monotonous, as the distance-based model is required for local reordering.

This approach is particularly effective for making local lexical choices and managing word reordering within short distances. However, it encounters significant challenges when dealing with long-distance reordering. For instance, the distance-based reordering model proposed by Koehn et al. in 2003 allows a decoder to translate out of order. This is achieved under the condition that the distance between two consecutively translated phrases does not exceed a predefined limit, known as the distortion limit. Although, in theory, this distortion limit can be set to a very high value to accommodate all possible reorderings, practical observations suggest otherwise. A high distortion limit can negatively impact both the efficiency of the translation process and its performance, as noted by Koehn et al. in 2005. In our experimental setup, we found that a distortion limit of 4 worked best for Chinese to English translation. Nevertheless, some ideal translations require reorderings that exceed this limit. Consider, for example, a sentence pair from the NIST MT2005 test set depicted in Figure 1(a). After translating the word \"\u4fee\u8865/mend,\" the decoder must \"jump\" across six words to translate the final phrase \"\u5173\u7cfb \u88c2\u7f1d/fissures in the relationship.\" Therefore, while short-distance reordering fits within the capabilities of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering remains problematic.\n\nTo clarify terminology, this paper will use \"global reordering\" and \"local reordering\" instead of \"long-distance reordering\" and \"short-distance reordering,\" respectively. The distinction between global and local reordering is entirely determined by the distortion limit. Syntax is often considered a promising solution for addressing global reordering issues. For instance, in the case of the last two Chinese phrases in Figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node results in the correct English word order. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that not all reorderings align neatly with syntactic analysis. Figure 1(b) illustrates a scenario where our phrase-based decoder successfully achieves a coherent English translation by reordering two blocks. Interestingly, the second Chinese block \"\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\" and its English equivalent \"at the end of\" are not constituents in the syntactic structure.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the potential of syntax in reordering. Our main assertion is that syntactic information can significantly enhance global reordering, leading to improved machine translation (MT) performance. This is achieved by building on the standard phrase-based model. To substantiate this claim, we have developed a hybrid approach. This method leverages the strengths of phrase-based SMT for local reordering while utilizing syntax for global reordering.\n\nOur approach draws inspiration from prior preprocessing methodologies introduced by researchers like Xia and McCord in 2004, Collins et al. in 2005, and Costa-juss\u00e0 and Fonollos\u00e0 in 2006. These methodologies involve a two-stage translation process. Initially, a source language (SL) sentence, denoted as S, is reordered to align with the target language (TL) word order. The reordered SL sentence, S', is then translated into a TL sentence, T, using a monotonous translation approach.\n\nOur first major contribution is the introduction of a novel translation model, as represented by formula 2. This model generates an n-best list of S', as opposed to only one S'. The rationale for this modification will be explained in Section 2. It's important to note that the translation process from S' to T is not entirely monotonous. The distance-based model remains necessary for local reordering tasks. Our second significant contribution is our definition of the best translation, described by another formula. In this model, Fi represents the features in the standard phrase-based model, while Pr(S \u2192 S\u2019) is a new feature we introduced. It calculates the probability of reordering S as S'. The intricacies of this model are discussed in detail in Sections 3 to 6.

If you're babysitting, take the toy with you when you leave, that way, you can bring it next time so the child has something special to play with while you're with them. Don't spoil the child with gifts every time you see them since they may start to expect something every time you see them. It can also make the child\u2019s parents feel uncomfortable. Rather than forcing the child to do an activity they don\u2019t want to do, see what they\u2019re interested in, and give them a few options for what toys to play with, and let them pick one out on their own. Let the child play with the toy for a minute to see what they\u2019re doing with it before playing with them, and if the child says they want to stop playing with something, let them find another thing to do. Let the kid get creative with how they play rather than forcing them to play how you want, for example, if the child likes to knock over blocks, then build different shape towers for them to destroy. Little kids like to goof around and have fun while they\u2019re playing, so act a little silly around them, make silly noises, tell silly jokes, and speak in a funny voice while you\u2019re playing to make them have more fun spending time with you. The more you\u2019re willing to loosen up and have fun, the more the children will listen and enjoy spending time around you, look for children\u2019s joke books so you can learn some funny and appropriate jokes to tell the kids. Kids have an active imagination, so being able to pretend with them will allow you to spend quality time together, if the child wants to play make-believe, ask them what they want to do, such as ride in a spaceship or play house. Listen to the kid as they make up what\u2019s happening to them, and respond to them to continue pretending, for example, if you play make-believe to be superheroes, you may ask where the bad guy is, what gadgets you have, and what powers you can use. If the child says they want to fly, pick them up if you\u2019re able so you can \u201cfly\u201d them around, and let the child to spend quality time with them.

However, it's important to remember that over-watering is a potential problem for nearly all plants, including avocados. Avoid watering so much that the avocado tree's soil looks liquid or muddy. Use soil with good drainage; one rich in organic matter is usually effective. Ensure your pot has drainage holes to allow excess water to escape. Follow these simple tips, and your plant should be free from the danger of over-watering. If your plant's leaves begin to turn yellow and you have been watering frequently, this may be a sign of over-watering. Stop watering immediately and resume only when the soil is dry. You may not need fertilizer to grow a strong, healthy avocado tree. However, used sensibly, fertilizers can noticeably boost a young plant's growth. Once established, add balanced citrus fertilizer to the soil during the growing season. Follow the directions included with the fertilizer. Do not overdo it \u2014 when it comes to commercial fertilizer, it is usually best to be somewhat conservative. Always water after fertilizing to ensure the fertilizer is absorbed into the soil and delivered directly to the plant's roots. Like many plants, avocados generally should not be fertilized when they are very young, as they can be very susceptible to the \"burn\" that can result from overusing fertilizer. Try waiting at least a year before fertilizing. Compared to other plants, avocados can be especially vulnerable to the buildup of salt in the soil. Avocado plants suffering from high salt levels may have slightly wilted leaves with \"burnt\", brown tips where excess salt is accumulating. To lower the salinity of your soil, adjust your watering practices. At least once a month, water heavily to soak the soil thoroughly. A heavy water flow carries built-up salts deep into the soil, away from the roots. Potted plants are especially susceptible to salt buildup. Once a month, place the pot in a sink or outside, then let water flow completely through the pot and drain out the bottom. Like any agricultural crop, avocado plants can suffer from a variety of pests and diseases that may threaten the quality of the plant's fruit or even endanger the entire plant. Knowing how to recognize and solve these issues is crucial to maintaining a healthy, productive avocado tree. Below are just a few of the most common avocado pests and illnesses \u2014 for more information, consult a botanical resource: Cankers \u2014 \"Rusty\", sunken sores on the plant that may ooze gum. Cut cankers from affected branches. Cankers on the trunk of the tree may kill the plant. Root rot \u2014 Usually caused by over-watering. Causes yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual decay even when all other conditions for growth are being met. Immediately stop over-watering and, if severe, dig up the roots to expose them to air. Sometimes fatal to plant. Wilts and Blights \u2014 \"Dead\" patches on the tree. Fruits and leaves within these patches wither and die. Remove affected areas immediately and clean your tools before using them again. Lace bugs \u2014 Cause yellow spots on leaves that quickly dry out. Damaged leaves may die and drop from the branch. Use a commercial pesticide or a natural insect-killing substance like pyrethrin. Borers \u2014 Bore into the tree, creating small holes that may ooze sap. A preventative cure is best \u2014 keeping trees healthy and well-nourished makes it harder for trees to be affected.

Aerobic exercise releases endorphins, which leave you feeling happier and more confident. Feeling good will help you get through these two weeks. Cutting calories and moving a lot more can be tiresome, but don't give up. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. If you are new to exercise, start slow and easy, then gradually increase the duration to 30 or 40 minutes. For instance, begin with jogging for 15 minutes and walking for the remaining 15 minutes. After the first week, jog for the full 30 minutes and increase your speed and intensity. Picking something you enjoy will make the next two weeks a lot easier. Swimming, kickboxing, dancing, and various sports can count toward your daily 30 minutes of aerobic exercise. To get the most out of your workout, make sure to get your heart pumping for at least 20 to 30 minutes so you work up a good sweat. Swimming is a great low-impact option that won't hurt your joints. Take a dance class with friends or family members to make exercise more enjoyable. Lifting weights will build lean muscle, necessary for revving your metabolism and burning fat throughout the day. Combining strength training with aerobic exercise is more effective for losing weight faster than doing just one or the other. Strength training doesn't count toward the daily minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity. If you don't know the proper form for dumbbell exercises, use the weight machines instead. If you plan to weigh yourself every few days, note that muscle weighs more than fat. Those muscles will help you burn more belly fat over the next two weeks. Start with simple and well-known exercises like bicep curls, push-ups, tricep curls, and chest presses. Do three sets of eight to ten reps. Use enough weight so you can maintain good form for the full set, and also rest between sets. HIIT elevates your heart rate and keeps your muscles guessing. HIIT is more effective at blasting more calories in a shorter period of time than low-intensity training. Work in HIIT at least three or four times a week, or do shorter HIIT routines every day in addition to aerobic exercise. For example, perform 30 to 60-second sprints while jogging to incorporate HIIT. Recover with two to four minutes of jogging at a moderate pace before the next burst. Even walking can be adjusted for an HIIT workout by changing your speed and adding hills. Walking is a great alternative if you have bad knees or other joint problems. Here's a 20-minute treadmill routine: start with a three-minute warmup, then brisk walk for three minutes, followed by two minutes of brisk walking, and so on. You can follow this routine every day to increase strength, toning, and balance. Working your core will help build and tone your abdominal and back muscles. Keep in mind that there's no such thing as \"spot\" training, but engaging your core will help you build lean muscle and burn more calories throughout the day. After just a week of core training, your posture will improve, making you appear leaner. Try common yoga moves like planks, warrior twists, and cobras to stretch and tone your core. For the next two weeks, make an effort to take the stairs or walk around more. Take a 10 to 20-minute walk after eating to help your body digest, burn extra calories, and keep your metabolism running. Get off the bus or subway a few stops early and walk the rest of the way.

Other models like Claude-3-Haiku, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Claude-3-Opus [Anthropic, 2024] have also made significant impacts in the field. LLaMA-3-70b [Touvron et al., 2023] and Mixtral-8x7b [Jiang et al., 2024] have contributed notably to solving various NLP challenges. These models have been particularly effective in tasks such as question answering [Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020b; Raffel et al., 2020], machine translation [Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020b], and text classification [Raffel et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019]. They have also excelled in text generation tasks [Yang et al., 2019; Achiam et al., 2023], offering improvements in creative and technical writing. However, when it comes to complex graph reasoning tasks, these models have shown notable inadequacies [Zhang, 2023]. Current research has highlighted that while LLMs can adeptly handle basic graph-related queries, they struggle with more complex graph structures. Multi-step reasoning processes present significant challenges for these models [Liu and Wu, 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Creswell et al., 2022].\n\nRecognizing these limitations, researchers are exploring ways to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in computational contexts. Figure 1 provides an overview of the evaluation framework used in this research. For each problem, researchers input a problem statement, data examples, and a code framework to the LLMs. The models then complete the code and provide explanations for their solutions. Finally, the framework evaluates the code on a specialized dataset called GraphEval2000 and returns detailed results.\n\nThe potential of leveraging LLMs\u2019 programming capabilities in computational contexts has been increasingly recognized [Yang et al., 2024; Murphy et al., 2024]. To address the shortcomings in graph reasoning, we propose utilizing the programming abilities of LLMs to enhance their performance on graph-related tasks. To this end, we introduce GraphEval2000, the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs through coding challenges. This dataset includes 40 data structure problems and 2,000 test cases, offering a comprehensive evaluation platform. Each problem within GraphEval2000 comprises: (1) a problem statement, (2) data examples, (3) constraints, and (4) a code framework. The dataset is organized into four main graph categories: Sparse, Planar, Regular, and Complete graphs. Within each main category, there are four sub-categories: connected, disconnected, cyclic, and acyclic graphs. This organization ensures a diverse representation of graph structures for evaluation.\n\nBased on the GraphEval2000 dataset, we propose an evaluation framework that provides real-time feedback to users. The framework is designed to systematically assess the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional coding challenges, such as those found on LeetCode, this framework reveals detailed test case outcomes [Hou and Ji, 2024; Hu et al., 2024]. Users receive information on failed test cases along with execution results, allowing for iterative improvements. To assist users in utilizing our framework effectively, we propose an instruction-based method called Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD). SSD is designed to enhance LLMs\u2019 ability to understand and solve complex graph problems. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive strategies [Paas and van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2020], SSD decomposes complex tasks into a \u201ccognitive step\u201d and an \u201caction step.\u201d This approach improves model comprehension and problem-solving abilities.\n\nExperiments have demonstrated that SSD significantly enhances the performance of models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o on challenging graph problems. Notably, these models showed performance improvements of 11.11%, 33.37%, and 33.37%, respectively. We hope this example inspires the community to further utilize our framework to explore LLMs\u2019 reasoning abilities on graphs. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n\nFirstly, we propose GraphEval2000, the first graph dataset specifically designed to evaluate the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs through code. This dataset includes 40 data structure problems and 2,000 graph test cases. It is organized into four primary graph categories, each containing four sub-categories, ensuring a diverse representation of graph structures. Secondly, based on GraphEval2000, we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs. This framework not only tests the models but also provides real-time feedback, enabling users to iteratively improve their models\u2019 performance. Thirdly, we have established the first benchmark for LLMs on graph data structure problems, involving eight of the most popular LLMs. Our experiment reveals that LLMs understand directed graph structures better than undirected ones. While open-source models generally underperform relative to private LLMs, the performance gap is narrow, and in certain graph categories, they demonstrate comparable performance.\n\nTo enhance the usability of our evaluation framework and GraphEval2000, we proposed Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD), an instruction-based method. SSD decomposes complicated problems into distinct reasoning components, facilitating better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSD, resulting in an average 25% improvement in performance for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. GraphEval2000 is released under the MIT license, making it accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. The dataset is available at harrywuhust2022.github.io/GraphEval2000.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Sentiment analysis has received considerable attention over the years in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its profound value in both academic research and industry applications, as it enables the extraction of subjective information from text data, allowing businesses and researchers to better understand customer opinions, market trends, and public sentiment on various topics, while also being applied in areas such as social media monitoring, brand reputation management, customer feedback analysis, financial forecasting, and political campaign strategies. Traditionally, studies in sentiment analysis had been mostly focused on high-resource languages such as English due to a deficit of annotated data in other low-resource languages, but recent research has emerged to address this issue by leveraging machine translation to augment data resources, which involves converting text from low-resource languages into high-resource ones to utilize existing annotated datasets, thereby enhancing the availability and quality of data across languages and facilitating more inclusive and comprehensive analysis, also allowing for the development of language models that are more robust and adaptable (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020) (Joshi et al., 2020). Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021), which offer significant advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle diverse linguistic inputs, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of sentiment analysis across different languages. Such multilingual pre-trained language models exploit the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from a mixture of many languages, facilitating zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from a source to a target language on different downstream NLP tasks, albeit with varying performance outcomes that can depend on the similarity between the source and target languages, as well as the amount and quality of training data available, which underscores the importance of strategic data selection and augmentation to maximize model performance and applicability in real-world scenarios (Lauscher et al., 2020). More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and the anticipated Llama-3 in 2024 have collected immense attention for their unparalleled performance in text generation, demonstrating capabilities such as coherent and contextually relevant text production, which surpasses previous models in fluency and adaptability across diverse topics, and excelling in tasks that require intricate understanding and creative outputs, facilitating innovative applications in content creation, personalized communication, and automated customer service. (Zhang et al., 2023) shows the strong capability of LLMs with few-shot in-context learning in public English sentiment analysis tasks, where models are exposed to a few examples of a task during runtime, allowing them to generalize and perform accurately with minimal explicit training, highlighting the efficiency and adaptability of these models, as well as their potential to revolutionize rapid learning and deployment in real-world applications, offering significant improvements in speed and resource utilization. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in public LLMs, which indicates their potential to understand and generate text in multiple languages, thus broadening their applicability across global markets and diverse linguistic landscapes, and offering opportunities for more inclusive and accessible AI technologies. Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, the capability of cross-lingual transfer in these LLMs has not been fully studied for sentiment analysis tasks, and it is still unclear how LLMs stand in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models in the cross-lingual transfer paradigm, making it necessary to explore their relative strengths, weaknesses, and potential integration methods to enhance sentiment analysis outcomes across languages, while also considering factors such as scalability, cost, and ease of implementation, which are crucial for the practical deployment of these technologies. In this work, we examine a variety of pre-trained models and conduct a comprehensive study on the cross-lingual transfer capability in utterance-level sentiment analysis tasks with human speech transcripts, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of different models in maintaining sentiment accuracy and consistency across languages, and identifying key factors that influence cross-lingual performance, such as linguistic similarities, model architecture, and training data characteristics, to provide a more robust framework for future research and application. We classify our candidate public pretrained models into two categories: Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLM) such as XLM-R and mT5, which are characterized by relatively compact architectures designed to balance performance with resource efficiency, making them suitable for scenarios with limited computational capacity, and Large Language Models (LLMs) that offer enhanced capabilities in data-rich environments. To avoid potential data contamination introduced in the pre-training process of recent LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023), we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets from in-house human conversation transcripts, employing meticulous processes to ensure data quality and relevance, including detailed validation procedures and cross-linguistic evaluations, and assess cross-lingual sentiment analysis from English to three target languages: Spanish, French, and Chinese, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of model performance across diverse linguistic scenarios, while maintaining stringent controls over data integrity and representativeness. Our evaluation results show that with the same supervised fine-tuning, SMLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capability even with much fewer model parameters, indicating their efficiency and effectiveness in transferring sentiment knowledge without extensive language-specific training, which could offer significant advantages in deployment speed and resource conservation, particularly in environments with limited computational resources. However, public LLMs exhibit rapid improvement in few-shot crosslingual transfer scenarios and can surpass the performance of SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are provided, showcasing their ability to learn quickly from a limited number of examples and adapt to new linguistic contexts, which can be particularly beneficial in dynamic or resource-constrained environments, as they offer flexibility and rapid adaptation to evolving data landscapes, enhancing their utility in real-time applications. Our contributions of this research can be summarized in the following dimensions: advancing the understanding of model capabilities in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various models, and providing insights that could guide future developments and applications in multilingual NLP, ultimately contributing to more effective and inclusive language technologies that cater to a global audience, and fostering innovation in how sentiment analysis can be conducted in a linguistically diverse world.", "scores": {"ppl": 30.415143966674805, "some": 0.8949496746063232, "bart": -2.0793697834014893, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Sentiment analysis, a pivotal facet of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has consistently garnered significant attention over the years. This heightened interest is largely attributable to its immense value in both scholarly research and practical industry applications. Traditionally, sentiment analysis studies have predominantly concentrated on languages with abundant resources, such as English. This focus arises from a noticeable shortage of annotated data available for other languages that are considered low-resource. To address this challenge, recent research endeavors have sought to utilize machine translation techniques. These techniques are employed to augment the data resources available for these low-resource languages, as highlighted in studies by Ara\u00fajo et al. (2020) and Joshi et al. (2020).\n\nIn addition to research efforts aimed at generating multilingual datasets specifically for sentiment analysis, there has been a noteworthy rise in the popularity of multilingual model architectures. This trend has gained momentum following the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models. Notable examples of such models include mBERT, introduced by Devlin et al. in 2019, XLM-R, developed by Conneau et al. in 2020, and mT5, created by Xue et al. in 2021. More recently, the BLOOM model, a product of the BigScience Workshop in 2022, has also emerged as a significant player in this arena. These multilingual pre-trained language models leverage the immense power of large-scale unsupervised textual data. This data is sourced from a diverse mix of languages, thereby enabling zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Such capabilities facilitate the transfer of knowledge from a source language to a target language across various downstream NLP tasks. However, it is important to note that the performance outcomes of these models can vary considerably, as discussed by Lauscher et al. (2020).\n\nIn recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a focal point of attention, particularly in the realm of text generation. Among these, GPT-3, introduced by Brown et al. in 2020, Llama-2, unveiled by Touvron et al. in 2023, and the anticipated Llama-3 in 2024, have garnered considerable acclaim for their unmatched performance. Zhang et al. (2023) have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of LLMs, particularly in few-shot in-context learning within public English sentiment analysis tasks. It is worth noting that while the majority of LLMs are pre-trained using corpora dominated by English content, some intriguing research has revealed interesting multilingual capabilities within both public and proprietary LLMs. This phenomenon has been explored in studies by Qin et al. (2024) and Zhu et al. (2023).\n\nDespite these advancements, it is important to acknowledge that a comprehensive understanding of cross-lingual transfer capabilities within LLMs, particularly for sentiment analysis tasks, remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, the full extent of cross-lingual transfer capabilities in LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. Consequently, it remains unclear how LLMs fare in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models within the context of cross-lingual transfer paradigms.\n\nIn this study, we embark on a thorough examination of various pre-trained models. Our primary focus is on conducting an exhaustive investigation into the cross-lingual transfer capabilities of these models in utterance-level sentiment analysis tasks. To achieve this, we categorize our candidate public pre-trained models into two distinct categories. The first category comprises Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLMs), which include models such as XLM-R and mT5. The second category consists of more recent Large Language Models (LLMs) that primarily focus on English, such as the upcoming Llama-3 in 2024 and the Mistral model introduced by Jiang et al. in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, our study also encompasses benchmarking efforts involving proprietary LLMs. These proprietary models, such as GPT-4, developed by OpenAI and set to be released in 2024, are widely regarded as the best LLMs in terms of general capability. To mitigate potential data contamination that may arise during the pre-training process of recent LLMs, as noted by Sainz et al. (2023), we undertake a meticulous curation and annotation of proprietary sentiment datasets. These datasets are derived from in-house human conversation transcripts and serve as a foundation for assessing cross-lingual sentiment analysis capabilities. Specifically, we evaluate the transfer of sentiment analysis capabilities from English to three target languages: Spanish, French, and Chinese.\n\nOur evaluation results provide valuable insights into the cross-lingual sentiment analysis landscape. The findings reveal that SMLMs, when subjected to the same supervised fine-tuning process, exhibit superior zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities, even when operating with significantly fewer model parameters. In contrast, public LLMs demonstrate rapid improvements in few-shot cross-lingual transfer scenarios. Notably, these LLMs can outperform SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are made available.\n\nIn summary, our research contributions can be encapsulated within several key dimensions. First and foremost, we provide a comprehensive examination of the cross-lingual transfer capabilities of both SMLMs and LLMs within the context of sentiment analysis tasks. Additionally, we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets, ensuring that our study is devoid of data contamination issues. Lastly, our evaluation results shed light on the comparative strengths and weaknesses of SMLMs and LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research endeavors in the field of cross-lingual NLP.", "scores": {"ppl": 60.02143478393555, "some": 0.8967951138814291, "bart": -2.2327449321746826, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}

While many define career success based on measurable qualities, such as salary and ranking, you can define success in your career based on your personal goals. Part of what makes it difficult to precisely define career success is that there are so many factors at play. Your relationship with coworkers, reputation in your field, salary, benefits, and more all play a role in determining whether you consider yourself successful. These factors contribute significantly to your sense of success. Many people feel overwhelmed by the various factors that influence their sense of success. To avoid feeling stressed about whether you're successful in traditional terms, view your career success in a personal manner, focusing on your own goals and aspirations. Do you feel fulfilled by your job? Are you happy going to work in the mornings? Much of success is unfortunately beyond your control. You need to accept that there are various definitions of success, and what ultimately matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment, which can be influenced by your personal goals and values. What were your goals when you were younger? What did you want to be when you grew up as a child? Are you using your degree? Why or why not? What were your childhood dreams and aspirations, and how have they changed over time? Oftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose track of their true passions and interests. Many people find themselves in a career that doesn't align with their true passions and interests. Conversely, people who feel stressed over their career often find success when their work aligns with their passion and values. Sometimes, defining your passions and values can help you develop a personal definition of success that aligns with your goals and aspirations. Acknowledging that your current situation may not align with your goals can be a scary realization. It can also be an opportunity to grow, to explore new career paths, and to develop new skills. If you always wanted to be a teacher, for example, but work in marketing, consider returning to school for a teaching degree. If you're interested in a career change, consider pursuing additional education or training. In some states, community colleges may offer alternative certification programs for teaching, allowing you to pursue your passion for teaching with just an undergraduate education. What is really important to you? What are your core values and priorities? Do you crave prestige and honor? Does climbing the corporate ladder align with your values and priorities, or are there other aspects of a career that are more important to you? Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you? Does the idea of making a positive impact in your community inspire you? There is no wrong way to crave success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you can help you define success. You can pursue success in many ways, but understanding what truly matters to you is key to defining success. It's essential to focus on your own goals and aspirations rather than comparing yourself to others. Studies have shown that the happiest and most fulfilled individuals across various careers are those who define success based on their personal goals, passions, and desires.

One of the most successful pre-training paradigms is the auto-regressive language model, exemplified by GPT-2, which also inspired the development of XLNet. This can be simplified as p(X) = T \u220f p(xi|x1, x2, ..., xi\u22121), where X is the sequence of text, and xi represents the i-th token. To improve the applicability of pre-trained language models and make them more adaptable to specific tasks, researchers have been focusing on developing more versatile language generation models that can be fine-tuned for various applications. However, these models often suffer from corpus overfitting, a problem that arises when a model becomes overly reliant on the specific dataset used for training. They aim to optimize the discriminator to find a generation path of the pre-trained language model that aligns with the target attribute. With the Bayes rule, BCLMs have transformed the language generation task into a combination of unconditional language generation and classification tasks. BCLMs typically train the discriminator on the task-specific corpus to model the conditional probability p(a|X1:i). We propose using GPT-2 to extract features from sentences in the task-specific corpus, which will serve as input to the discriminator. This is analogous to saying that the discriminator has been pre-trained on a large-scale general-purpose corpus. In inference, the tokens are generated one by one at each step, and the process unfolds step by step. However, the computational cost of extracting features for each sentence is substantial. The Gemini utilizes features extracted by GPT-2 as input during training, and it exhibits a relatively low computational cost during inference. Additionally, inspired by nucleus sampling and the decoding strategy in GeDi, we develop an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method that balances fluency and attribute relevance in generation. On both tasks, Gemini achieved state-of-the-art performance, as demonstrated by both automatic and human evaluations.

This fascination stems from the profound insights bilingualism offers into the intricate mechanisms underlying language acquisition and processing. Over time, this field has evolved to encompass the study of multilingualism, which has further contributed to the development of more sophisticated machine learning models. These models, including neural translation systems, have been significantly enhanced by insights gleaned from multilingual research (Zou et al., 2013).\n\nWith the advent and rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the landscape of linguistic research has transformed. Researchers have uncovered a multitude of emergent properties in these models (Wei et al., 2022a), repurposing them for a diverse array of applications (Wei et al., 2022b). Despite these advancements, the exploration into the multilingual capabilities of these models remains relatively nascent. Previous studies have demonstrated that large language models, such as the well-known GPT, are proficient in executing a wide spectrum of language tasks, particularly when the tasks are framed in English (Qin et al., 2023). Nonetheless, the depth of investigation into their multilingual proficiencies has been somewhat limited.\n\nShi et al. (2023) delve into this domain by applying these models to multilingual datasets, meticulously measuring performance disparities across various languages. However, their research stops short of delving into the underlying mechanisms that enable LLMs to perform disparate tasks, nor does it examine the potential impact of these mechanisms on the outcomes. Moreover, the prevailing trend is that most LLMs, as noted by Brown et al. (2020) and Touvron et al. (2023), are trained predominantly on datasets that are heavily biased towards the English language. This leaves the intriguing question of how these models acquire their multilingual capabilities unresolved.\n\nIn this study, we embark on a systematic exploration of the multilingual capabilities inherent in LLMs. To ensure a thorough and comprehensive analysis, we propose an innovative framework for categorizing language-dependent abilities. We divide these abilities into three distinct categories based on the degree to which language choice impacts performance: Reasoning, Knowledge Access, and Articulation. Each category represents a different level of language impact, with Reasoning being the least affected by language choice and Articulation being the most.\n\nOur investigation involves a carefully curated set of tasks derived from these three categories. To evaluate the multilingual abilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel prompting method known as response back-translation (RBT). This innovative method allows us to measure not only the multilingual performance of LLMs but also to discern the type of multilinguality they exhibit. For instance, we critically assess the capabilities of LLMs in tasks such as pun detection, which is highly dependent on language nuances.\n\nThe findings of our experiments reveal that the widely used LLM, GPT, demonstrates some intriguing patterns. Notably, it achieves higher performance when tasks are presented in English. Furthermore, it excels in tasks that can be translated without altering the correctness of the output. Interestingly, our analysis also indicates that GPT exhibits a blend of coordinate and subordinate bilingualism, reflecting its complex multilingual nature.\n\nOur research contributions are multifaceted and groundbreaking. Firstly, we provide a pioneering quantitative and qualitative analysis of the multilingual abilities of LLMs, offering valuable insights into their functioning. Secondly, we introduce two novel task categorizations that facilitate a more nuanced analysis of multilingual abilities.

Among the most appealing pretraining paradigms is the auto-regressive language model, like GPT2 [29] and XLNet [37]. With billions or even trillions of parameters and ample unlabeled data, PLMs can produce diverse and realistic sentences. Formally, an autoregressive PLM models the probability distribution of text X = {x1, x2, ..., xT} using the chain rule: T (cid:89) p(X) = p(xi|x1, x2, ..., xi\u22121). (1) i=1 However, these models are generally trained on a broad corpus, and the sentences they generate often fail to align with task requirements. Therefore, enhancing PLMs' applicability by making them more adaptable is crucial in natural language generation. Adaptable language generation aims to model p(X|a), where a is a desired attribute (e.g., topic, length, sentiment): p(X|a) = T (cid:89) i=1 p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a). (2) To simplify, we use X1:i to denote the sequence {x1, x2, ..., xi}. Earlier approaches directly model p(X|a) by maximizing the likelihood of task-specific corpora. These methods are called Class Conditional Language Models (CCLMs) [39; 12; 15]. Due to limited training data for specific attributes, CCLMs often suffer from overfitting to the corpus. Bayesian Controllable Language Models (BCLMs) [5; 18; 36] were proposed to tackle this overfitting issue. They seek a generation path of the pre-trained model that aligns with the target attribute. BCLMs employ a discriminator to model the class probability p(a|X1:i) and sample the desired output from p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) using Bayes Rule: p(xi|X1:i\u22121, a) \u221d p(a|X1:i)p(xi|X1:i\u22121). (3) Using Bayes Rule, BCLMs transform the adaptable language generation task into a mix of unconditional language generation and classification tasks. Since p(xi|X1:i\u22121) can be derived from an existing PLM (in this study, we use the GPT2 model), BCLMs only need to model p(a|X1:i). BCLMs typically train the discriminator with sentences from the task-specific corpus to model p(a|X1:i). However, during inference, the discriminator processes text generated by GPT2, differing from the training corpus. This mismatch between training and inference hampers BCLMs' performance. In this work, we propose using GPT2 to extract features from the task-specific corpus sentences and use these as input to the discriminator. Given GPT2's pre-training on a general-purpose corpus, it likely \"recognizes\" similar task-specific sentences. This is akin to saying the discriminator has been pre-trained on a large-scale general-purpose corpus. This approach mitigates the mismatch problem in BCLMs. However, this task is challenging. In Equation (3), xi is generated at step i during inference. To determine xi's probability distribution, we need to calculate p(a|X1:i\u22121, w) for each token w in the vocabulary. Extracting sentence features {X1:i\u22121, w} for every token w in the vocabulary is costly. To address efficiency concerns, we introduce the \"Gemini Discriminator\" (Gemini) for adaptable language generation. Gemini utilizes features extracted by GPT2 during training and incurs minimal computational cost during inference. To enhance Gemini's performance, we employ knowledge distillation [9; 17] in training. Additionally, inspired by nucleus sampling [11] and GeDi's [18] decoding strategy, we develop an attribute-driven nucleus sampling method. This method considers both fluency and attribute relevance during generation. We tested two adaptable language generation tasks: sentiment control and topic control. Gemini achieved new state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations across these tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 63.814815521240234, "some": 0.8732158342997233, "bart": -1.4673298597335815, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}

Candidates are evaluated on their problem-solving skills and coding efficiency, which makes it a challenging task for developers. This requires developers to have strong programming skills, attention to detail, and the ability to think critically under pressure. Additionally, they must be able to handle complex algorithms and debug their code effectively. Three identical questions, each with distinct answers, are arranged in various orientations. This creates a challenging problem for developers, as they need to understand the layout of the code and the relationships between different elements. The questions are designed to test the developers' ability to understand the code and identify the correct answers. To make a comparison, we excluded the space markers from the original data, which results in a substantial decline in performance. This highlights the importance of layout information in enhancing LLMs' capabilities and demonstrates the impact of layout on performance. Furthermore, this comparison shows that layout information plays a crucial role in improving the performance of LLMs. First, we built a dataset called TextLayoutQA, which is designed to evaluate LLMs' text layout understanding capability. This dataset contains a variety of examples with different layouts, which are used to test the performance of LLMs in understanding and processing text layout information. The dataset is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities. This results in an 8\u201333% improvement compared to text without layout, which indicates the significant impact of layout information on LLMs' performance. This improvement is due to the ability of LLMs to understand and process layout information, which enables them to perform better in a variety of tasks. Furthermore, this improvement highlights the importance of considering layout information in natural language processing tasks.

Their capabilities and constraints have sparked comprehensive discussions among researchers, driving the exploration of their potential beyond their initial design for natural language processing (NLP) tasks [17, 2, 24]. While LLMs are fundamentally built to tackle NLP challenges, emerging studies reveal their versatile capabilities. For instance, these models are now being employed to generate executable code and have even demonstrated remarkable success in Google coding interviews [6]. This unexpected versatility showcases their expansive potential.\n\nBeyond mere text comprehension, LLMs have shown an intriguing ability to process and interpret text layouts marked by spatial indicators. As illustrated in Figure 1, we can conceptualize newline-separated plain text as a \"visual\" two-dimensional canvas. This conceptualization aligns with the intuitive visual structure of text editors and browsers. In our experiments, we arranged three identical questions with distinct answers in various orientations, using space markers to denote different layouts. We then queried ChatGPT with these structured texts. Astonishingly, ChatGPT managed to provide accurate responses, and some open-source LLMs also produced reasonable results. \n\nIn contrast, when space markers were excluded from the original data\u2014denoted as \"strip\"\u2014a substantial decline in performance was observed. This stark contrast underscores the importance of layout markers in aiding LLMs' comprehension. More illustrative examples are detailed in Appendix A. This study lays the groundwork for a comprehensive examination of how LLMs understand text layout, aiming to provide insights into their performance across different datasets and fine-tuning methodologies.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario in the layout experiment: (a) Layout Here are three names mentioned in the context: What is your name? I\u2019m James. What is your name? I\u2019m Oliver. What is your name? I\u2019m Emma. Question: What is the name mentioned in the top-left corner? Answer: The name mentioned in the top-left corner is \u201cJames.\u201d (b) Strip Here are three names mentioned in the context: What is your name? What is your name? I\u2019m James. I\u2019m Oliver. What is your name? I\u2019m Emma. Question: What is the name mentioned in the top-left corner? Answer: The name mentioned in the top-left corner is not specified in the given context. \n\nFigure 1 vividly illustrates ChatGPT's capability to comprehend text layout. Building on these insights, we developed a dataset called TextLayoutQA to rigorously assess LLMs' proficiency in understanding text layouts. Through extensive experiments using models like GPT-3.5/4, Baichuan2 [45], Llama2 [39], and ChatGLM3 [48], we discovered that integrating text layout information significantly enhances model performance. This integration results in an impressive performance gain of 8\u223c33% compared to text presented without layout information.\n\nFurthermore, we delved into the effects of pre-training and instruction-tuning stages on LLMs' comprehension of text layout. Our findings reveal that although LLMs exhibit a foundational understanding of text layout during pre-training, their proficiency is markedly improved during the instruction-tuning phase. This enhancement underscores the vital role of instructional guidance in refining LLMs' capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the critical role of training data in shaping LLMs' understanding of text layout. Our study emphasizes the necessity of datasets enriched with layout information, such as those containing code and table data. Through instruction-tuning, we uncovered the varying impacts of different types of datasets on LLMs' performance. These insights provide a detailed understanding of their contributions and limitations, highlighting the nuanced ways in which training data influences LLMs' capabilities.\n\nOur findings not only illuminate the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs in comprehending text layout but also carry significant implications for their broader applications. By unraveling the intricacies of LLMs' interaction with text layout information, we pave the way for leveraging this capability in various tasks. These tasks range from visual question answering (VQA) [26] to document analysis and beyond. Our research underscores the potential to harness LLMs' text layout understanding for advancing these applications, thereby broadening the scope of AI's impact.\n\nFor those interested in further exploration, our code and datasets are made accessible on GitHub.1 This openness invites collaboration and further research into the exciting domain of LLMs' interaction with text layouts. \n\nTo summarize the contributions of this paper: 1. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically analyze the text layout understanding capability of LLMs. 2. We introduce TextLayoutQA, a dataset specifically designed to assess the text layout understanding capability of LLMs. Through this work, we contribute a foundational understanding that serves as a springboard for future research and application development in the realm of LLMs and their interaction with structured text.", "scores": {"ppl": 73.50796508789062, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -2.730029821395874, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "In recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants. Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has been widely used as the gauge of Machine Translation system evaluation. However, the research community has been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU metric. BLEU captures only a single dimension of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate translation gets acknowledged only if it uses exactly the same lexicon as the reference translation. However, natural languages are characterized by their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction via a large number of syntactic, lexical, and semantic rewriting rules. Although BLEU has been shown to correlate positively with human assessments at the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to improve state-of-the-art MT require that human assessment be approximated at sentence level as well. Researchers report the BLEU score at document level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams in BLEU scoring, but document-level MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the granularity of the sentence. Unfortunately, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005, 2006). While acknowledging the appealing simplicity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an MT candidate translation\u2019s quality, it is essential to note that the following facts about n-gram based MT metrics are crucial. First, they may not reflect the mechanism of how human beings evaluate sentence translation quality. More specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee the optimization of sentence quality approved by human assessors. Therefore, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessment at sentence level for most candidate translations. Second, human beings are generally more reliable at ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than assigning a numeric value to index the quality of a candidate translation. Consequently, a more intuitive approach for automatic MT evaluation is to replicate the quality ranking ability of human assessors. Thirdly, the BLEU score is elusive and hard to interpret, for instance, what can be concluded for a candidate translation\u2019s quality if the BLEU score is 0.0168, particularly when we are aware that even a human translation can receive an embarrassingly low BLEU score? In light of this discussion, we propose an alternative scenario for MT evaluation, where, instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation under evaluation, we predict its rank with regard to its peer candidate translations. This formulation of the MT evaluation task fills the gap between an automatic scoring function and human MT evaluation practice. The results from the current study will also inform the research community about which features are useful in improving the correlation between human rankings and automatic rankings.", "scores": {"ppl": 69.74939727783203, "some": 0.8886987368265787, "bart": -0.48125362396240234, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Headline generation is essential for summarizing news articles and capturing readers' attention. This task involves creating headlines that are both informative and captivating, accurately reflecting the essence of the underlying text. The challenge of headline generation arises from two main factors: first, headlines must concisely represent the content, requiring a balance between key information and brevity. Second, headlines need to be attention-grabbing to compel readers to click and read further, which involves using persuasive language, creativity, and rhetorical devices. In recent years, the NLP community has made significant progress in developing headline-generation models. However, the focus has largely been on English and other widely spoken languages, leaving a gap in headline generation for Indian languages. While datasets like Gigaword have become prominent resources with over 4 million news article-headline pairs, they are limited to English and do not capture the linguistic nuances of Indian languages. India, with its rich linguistic diversity, has over 22 officially recognized languages, each with unique grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Addressing headline generation in Indian languages requires understanding these linguistic and cultural intricacies. A major obstacle is the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, which limits model training and the effectiveness of supervised learning approaches. Recent advancements in neural network architectures, such as transformer-based models, have improved headline generation performance. These models can encode input text and generate headlines by optimizing objectives like semantic coherence, informativeness, and readability. Although they reduce dependency on labeled data, fine-tuning on specialized datasets enhances their performance. In Bengali, Salehin et al. (2019) and Amin et al. (2021) collected data from news websites using web scraping and proposed an RNN-based encoder-decoder model with attention for headline generation. Another resource, XL-Sum, introduced by Hasan et al. (2021), includes 251K article-headline pairs from BBC in Indian languages. To advance NLG research for Indian languages, Kumar et al. (2022) proposed the IndicNLG benchmark, which includes a headline generation dataset (IndicHG) with 1.31 million article-headline pairs across 11 Indian languages.

This complexity is compounded by the necessity for cross-domain collaboration among experts from diverse fields, a challenge that is particularly evident in the growing number of requirements that span multiple stakeholder domains. \n\nIn systems engineering, particularly within the automotive sector, requirements are traditionally documented in natural language, often supplemented with visual aids such as pictures or Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. These textual requirements are interpreted by experts as they move into the design phase, frequently deriving implementation details directly from the documentation. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language, especially when interpreted by experts from varying backgrounds, coupled with the escalating volume of requirements, can lead to reduced product quality and system failures. These issues are often detected late in the development process, posing significant obstacles to the implementation of functional safety standards like ISO 26262.\n\nAdditionally, the conventional document-based approach to requirements engineering is not conducive to agile development practices.

These models not only serve as documentation and communication tools for engineers but also as inputs for various analyses and syntheses, such as verification, test case generation, or even code generation.\n\nMDE can be particularly advantageous in facilitating the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems. While approaches to integrate MDE into automotive requirements engineering do exist, the introduction of MDE is not without its challenges. Initial costs and efforts for training domain experts in modeling are necessary, as is the often daunting task of translating numerous documents into models. Employing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) instead of general-purpose modeling languages, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), offers distinct advantages. The syntax and semantics of DSLs can be tailored to be intuitive for their users, significantly enhancing the usability and comprehension of models developed in such a DSL.\n\nGiven that requirements are typically documented in natural language, a textual DSL that mirrors current requirement formulations in its sentence structures and wording is assumed to substantially increase the intuitiveness of both usage and understanding of models in the DSL. However, beyond the costs associated with DSL development and training, the translation of legacy, unstructured requirements into DSL models can demand considerable effort due to the sheer volume of requirements. This task requires substantial time and modeling expertise from the developers tasked with the translation.\n\nThis paper explores an open-source dataset of automotive requirements for ADAS and Adaptive Light Systems (ALS) to identify where formulation inaccuracies occur. It also examines how targeted DSL constructs can help eliminate these inaccuracies, thereby increasing the level of formality and consistency in the requirements. The primary goal and contribution of this paper is the application and evaluation of few-shot learning using large neural natural language models to facilitate the translation of unstructured requirements into sentences that incorporate new formal DSL constructs.\n\nSuch translation models can be employed during the initial phase of DSL implementation to automatically convert existing or legacy natural language requirements into the new DSL syntax. They can also serve to correct natural language inputs in a smart editor when a requirement engineer drafts a new requirement as natural text. The automation provided by few-shot learning, which requires only a limited number of translation examples to grasp a given translation task, aims to ease the introduction of highly specialized requirement DSLs. These DSLs can be tailored to address the needs of a specific department within a company or even a single project, using unique wording.\n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the technical foundations of our approach; Section 3 highlights the challenges and potentials of adopting an MDE approach for requirements engineering within domains characterized by natural-language text-based documents. Section 4 outlines related work in this area. Section 5 presents an example DSL designed for capturing requirements in the automotive domain. Section 6 details the process of automatic translation from natural language to the DSL. In Section 7, we evaluate the approach through multiple experiments. We address threats to the validity of our findings in Section 8, and Section 9 concludes the paper.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The phrase-based approach has been widely regarded as the default strategy in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) over recent years, and it remains the standard approach in the field, which is widely accepted in the research community. It is well-known that the phrase-based approach is particularly powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within a short distance, and consequently, this capacity enables the model to achieve impressive results in this area. However, long-distance reordering poses a significant problem in phrase-based SMT, which can lead to suboptimal translation results and necessitates an alternative strategy that addresses this issue effectively. For example, the distance-based reordering model, introduced by Koehn et al. in 2003, allows a decoder to translate in a non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as the distortion limit. This model was proposed by Koehn et al. in 2003 to address the challenges of long-distance reordering in SMT. However, the model has some limitations that need to be addressed. This model can be seen as a solution to the limitations of the phrase-based approach, which effectively addresses its inability to handle long-distance reordering, and it has been widely adopted in recent years, providing improved performance in this area. In theory, the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value, allowing all possible reorderings, but this approach comes with significant drawbacks and challenges that need to be carefully considered. However, assigning too high a distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance, as observed by Koehn et al. in 2005, and it is essential to find the optimal balance between the two factors. In our experiment setting, the optimal distortion limit for Chinese-English translation is 2, which provides a good balance between efficiency and translation quality, and it has been widely adopted in practice, demonstrating its effectiveness. However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings that exceed this distortion limit, rendering it ineffective in certain cases and highlighting its limitations, which need to be addressed in future research. Considerations of syntax are crucial in understanding the complexities of language translation, and developing a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the subtleties of human language and its intricacies is essential for achieving improved performance. The sentence pair in the NIST MT2005 test set presents a challenge to the distance-based model, which is not equipped to handle long-distance reordering, and this challenge is a significant one that needs to be addressed. This renders the distance-based model useless in certain cases, where the distortion limit is exceeded, and a more effective approach is needed to overcome this limitation and rectify the issue, which has significant implications for SMT research. Therefore, while short-distance reordering is within the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question, and a more effective approach is needed to address this challenge, which has been a long-standing issue in the field. A terminological remark is necessary to avoid confusion in the terminology used throughout the paper and to ensure clarity, which is essential for effective communication. The distinction between global and local reordering is solely defined by the distortion limit, which is a crucial factor in determining the scope of the reordering process, and it is essential to understand this distinction and its implications, which have significant implications for SMT research. Syntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering, but it is not the only factor at play, and other considerations must be taken into account in developing a comprehensive translation model, requiring careful consideration of the complexities of human language. However, not all reorderings can be explained by syntax alone, and other factors, such as semantics and pragmatics, also play a significant role in determining the optimal translation, which is a complex and multifaceted issue. However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on syntax, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to effectively handle global reordering and address this challenge, which has significant implications for SMT research. These cases highlight the limitations of relying solely on syntax, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to effectively handle global reordering, which is a critical issue in SMT research. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder achieves a good English translation by reordering two blocks effectively, and this approach has been widely adopted in recent years, providing improved performance in this area. It should be noted that the second Chinese block \u201c\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u201d and its English counterpart \u201cat the end of\u201d are not constituents at all, and their reordering is not driven by syntax alone, highlighting the complexities of language translation, which is a multifaceted issue. In this paper, our primary focus is on the role of syntax in reordering, and our main contribution is the finding that syntactic information is valuable in handling global reordering, leading to improved performance compared to the standard phrase-based model, which is a significant contribution to the field. To substantiate this claim, we developed a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of phrase-based SMT in local reordering with syntax-based global reordering, providing a more effective solution to the challenge of reordering, which has significant implications for SMT research. Our approach is based on previous preprocessing methods, such as those of Xia and McCord (2004), Collins et al. (2005), and Costa-jussa and Fonollos\u00e0 (2006), which split the translation process into two stages, providing a more efficient approach to translation. The second stage involves translating the reordered sentence into a target language sentence, which is a crucial step in the overall translation process, requiring careful consideration of the complexities of human language, which is a multifaceted issue. This change is essential to accommodate the reordering process, enabling the decoder to produce a more accurate translation, and it has been widely adopted in practice, demonstrating its effectiveness in this area. Our second contribution is a new definition of the best translation, as represented by formula X, where Fi are the features from the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S \u2192 S') is our novel feature, which calculates the probability of reordering S as S', providing a more accurate measure of translation quality. The details of this model are provided in sections 3-6, where its implementation and evaluation are discussed in detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the approach, which has significant implications for SMT research. The experimental settings and results are presented in detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the approach, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach, which has significant implications for SMT research.", "scores": {"ppl": 34.708824157714844, "some": 0.8726889292399088, "bart": -2.6912755966186523, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "On the first day of class, each professor should provide you with a comprehensive syllabus outlining the course requirements and schedule. The syllabus will detail all necessary materials for each class and include a schedule of assignments along with their due dates. It's crucial to thoroughly read each syllabus as soon as it is distributed to you. Make sure to highlight the materials you need and note important information such as attendance and late work policies. Should anything be unclear, do not hesitate to ask your professor for clarification. Revisiting the syllabus several times throughout the semester can be advantageous for reminding yourself of vital course information. Acquiring all the required reading materials for your classes is essential for your academic success. Once you receive the syllabus for each class, take it to the school bookstore and systematically check off each subject as you purchase the corresponding books. Afterward, double-check your list to ensure you haven't overlooked any items. Keep in mind that your teacher will not provide materials they have asked you to acquire independently. Unlike in high school, borrowing a book from the teacher is typically not an option in college. Using your syllabi, organize your schoolbooks at home in the chronological order in which you will need them. This preparation will ensure you can navigate your coursework efficiently, without struggling to find a title at the last minute. While you are at the bookstore, consider purchasing a calendar that covers several months, allowing you to track dorm events, exams, papers, and thesis presentations. Opt for a planner that is convenient to carry and offers ample space for notes. Although digital planners are available, a paper planner allows you to view tasks over several months at a glance. Digital planners often require additional steps to view detailed information, whereas a paper planner displays all events and notes in a straightforward manner. Before classes begin, transfer important dates from your syllabi into your calendar to stay ahead of deadlines. This proactive approach helps you prepare for times when projects or tests for different classes coincide. Review your syllabi and inventory the basic school supplies needed for assignments, such as binders, pens, dividers, and notepaper. Make a list and check off items you already own, then purchase any missing supplies from an office supply store like OfficeMax or Staples. Implementing a color-coding system can further enhance your organizational efforts. Assign a distinct color to each subject and purchase corresponding binders, notebooks, and other materials in those colors. This method simplifies tracking your notes and materials, ensuring you always know where to find what you need.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020b), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), have exhibited remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question-answering, by effectively learning contextual information and nuanced language patterns, and notably, their multilingual versions have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual settings, enabling them to handle multiple languages without explicit training data for each, which significantly broadens their applicability (Pires et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019). In these scenarios, when PLMs are fine-tuned on English data, often with limited or even without data from other languages, they acquire the proficiency to handle tasks in different languages; however, multilingual PLMs are typically constructed using stacked transformer layers or their variants, employing self-attention mechanisms to capture diverse and distant dependencies among tokens, allowing the model to understand complex linguistic structures across languages, but the use of self-attention introduces significant computational complexity due to the need to calculate attention scores between every pair of tokens, which grows quadratically with the number of tokens, and consequently, the inference complexity of multilingual PLMs has become a bottleneck, limiting their deployment on devices sensitive to latency and constrained by computational resources. To fulfill the stringent requirements for efficient inference in applications, various methods have been proposed to accelerate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) inference, such as model compression, early exiting, and model cascading; these methods include model compression, which reduces the size of PLMs by pruning unnecessary parameters (Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020, 2019), early exiting which allows models to terminate inference early if a high confidence prediction is made (Xin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2021), and model cascading (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022), where simpler models are used first before switching to more complex ones if needed. Model cascading methods are particularly appealing for several reasons: 1) They do not depend on specific hardware support, such as custom chips and GPUs, making them more versatile and easier to implement across different systems. 2) They eliminate the need to train an inference-efficient model from scratch on the pre-training corpora, saving both time and computational resources, and 3) They offer flexibility to adapt to the latest, incrementally powerful PLMs, allowing seamless integration with evolving technologies. Model cascading methods involve the aggregation of multiple PLMs with different sizes, creating a tiered system where smaller, faster models are used initially, with larger ones activated only if necessary; confidence scores are computed sequentially, ranging from small to large size models, to determine the appropriate model to employ, ensuring that only the required computational resources are used for each inference task; once a confidence score surpasses a threshold, the corresponding model is selected, and the inference process ends, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency.", "scores": {"ppl": 29.68890953063965, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -1.5972281694412231, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and Llama have achieved outstanding results in various NLP tasks, showcasing their adaptability across languages. Their multilingual versions are particularly impressive, demonstrating zero-shot transfer capabilities in cross-lingual contexts, even when fine-tuned primarily on English data. This proficiency allows them to perform tasks in multiple languages without extensive additional training data. However, these multilingual models are typically built using stacked transformer layers and self-attention mechanisms, which introduce significant computational demands. This complexity becomes a bottleneck, especially when deploying models on devices with limited resources or latency constraints. To address these challenges, several methods have emerged aimed at accelerating PLM inference. These include model compression, early exiting, and model cascading. Among these strategies, model cascading stands out due to its lack of reliance on specialized hardware and its ability to adapt to evolving PLMs without retraining from scratch. Model cascading involves sequentially computing confidence scores across models of varying sizes to select the most efficient one for inference. Despite their advantages, cascade-based models face limitations in cross-lingual scenarios. The confidence score, which measures the probability of the current prediction being correct in cascade-based models, is determined by the maximum output threshold determined on English data to be applicable to other languages. To address this, we propose a plugin calibration step at the base of multilingual PLMs. This involves normalizing logits to reduce overconfidence during model fine-tuning and implementing temperature scaling with a learnable scalar parameter. Our framework calibrates each model within the cascade, enhancing reliability and performance across languages. Importantly, the framework requires only a minimal calibration module, maintaining the original architecture of multilingual PLMs. This ensures compatibility with the latest models while imposing minimal training overhead. Our primary contribution is C3, a framework designed to enhance cross-lingual inference efficiency without compromising accuracy. Notably, this is the first work focused on creating inference-efficient models specifically for cross-lingual tasks. We address the overconfidence phenomenon observed in encoder-only and decoder-only PLMs, which correlates with linguistic distance. Our plugin calibration module effectively tackles this issue. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like XNLI, PAWS-X, QAM, GSM8k, and TabMWP, covering both text classification and generation, show C3 significantly outperforms baselines.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Draw your pattern on a large piece of graph paper that accurately represents the size you need to work with in order to ensure precise measurements and achieve a high level of accuracy. Cut the pattern into its individual components, and label each piece by color and grain direction for precision and easy identification, which is crucial for streamlining the project and reducing errors. Place the pattern under the glass and carefully trace the outline with a thin, permanent marker to ensure accuracy and prevent mistakes, which can be costly and time-consuming to rectify. Leave a small margin of space, typically one centimeter or less, between the pieces for the thickness of the copper foil to enable a smooth fit and prevent any potential problems or complications that may arise. Use a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass surface clearly and distinctly for better visibility and to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation of the design. If you have access to a lightbox, this can be incredibly helpful for accurately tracing the pattern onto the glass surface for precise results and to save a significant amount of time and effort. Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger, with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger, positioning your hand for a stable and secure grip that will enable you to make precise cuts. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to ensure a straight and even cut every time and to maintain precision and accuracy throughout the process. Begin at a point away from your body and start scraping inward, applying gentle pressure to the glass to achieve a smooth score line and to prevent any chips or cracks that may compromise the integrity of the glass. Make sure you are applying the correct amount of pressure to the glass cutter to achieve a smooth score line, which is essential for a clean break and to avoid any difficulties or complications that may arise. You should hear a distinct, clear 'zzzzip' sound as you score the glass successfully, indicating a precise cut and a well-executed process that requires a high level of skill and precision. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line as it should, resulting in an uneven cut that can be difficult to work with and may require additional time and effort to correct and refine. Too much pressure will cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter, as well as your wrist and elbow, leading to discomfort and potential injury, so it's crucial to find the right balance and apply the correct amount of pressure. Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to maintain proper form and alignment, ensuring a precise fit and a smooth finish to your project that requires attention to detail and a high level of precision. Make sure that the score line spans the entire edge of the glass for a clean break and a smooth finish, which can be a major challenge if not done correctly and requires a high level of skill and precision. There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size, shape, and curve of the glass you are working with, and each method has its own unique challenges and requirements that demand a high level of skill and attention to detail. The primary goal is to cut the glass along the scored lines, allowing it to break apart easily and yielding the necessary shapes for your project, which can be a complex and time-consuming process requiring a high degree of skill and precision. For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze gently to separate the piece cleanly, using gentle pressure to avoid chipping the glass and to achieve a smooth finish that requires a high level of precision and skill. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart carefully, avoiding excessive pressure, which can cause the glass to shatter or chip and may require additional time and effort to repair and refine. For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring carefully and smoothly, applying gentle pressure to avoid chipping the glass and to maintain a smooth, even curve that requires a high level of precision and attention to detail. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if necessary, as long as your curves remain gentle and smooth, which is essential for a professional finish and a high-quality product that requires a high level of skill and precision. If you're dealing with deep curves, break them down into a series of shallow curves so that they won't break on their own unexpectedly, which can be a common problem when working with curved glass and can be time-consuming to fix and requires a high level of skill and attention to detail. Once you've completed cutting, place the pieces along the pattern again and grind down the glass into corrective lines, ensuring a precise fit and a smooth finish to your project that requires a high level of skill and precision. Regular sandpaper can also be used to remove sharp edges and smooth out the glass surfaces, which can be a time-consuming process but is essential for a professional finish and a high-quality product that requires a high level of skill and attention to detail. Wear protective gloves to avoid accidentally cutting your hand if you slip while handling the glass and sandpaper, which can be a serious injury requiring medical attention and demands a high level of caution and attention to safety. If you use a glass grinder, you should wear a mask and goggles to prevent glass particles from being breathed in or settling in your eyes, which can cause serious health problems and may require long-term medical treatment and demands a high level of caution and attention to safety. You will want to grind away gently and patiently, taking your time to avoid chipping any pieces and achieve the desired results, which can be a complex and challenging process requiring a high degree of skill and precision. It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces once you've finished grinding them and fitting them together, providing additional support and stability to the glass and helping to prevent any accidents or injuries that may occur. This prevents the pieces from slipping when applying copper foil, making the process easier and more efficient, which can save you a lot of time and effort and improve the overall quality of your project and demands a high level of skill and attention to detail. Cover the edges of the glass with a consistent layer of copper foil that is approximately 7/32 inch in thickness, which can be a precise and challenging process requiring a high degree of skill and attention to detail and demands a high level of precision. Make sure the foil is centered on the glass edge, otherwise it can look slightly uneven or 'funny' when completed, which can be a major aesthetic problem and may require additional time and effort to correct and refine and demands a high level of attention to detail. This can be accomplished by hand or with the use of a specialized table foiler, depending on your personal preference and needs, which can be a time-consuming and challenging process requiring a high degree of skill and precision and demands a high level of attention to detail.", "scores": {"ppl": 24.448654174804688, "some": 0.8729609648386637, "bart": -2.2656712532043457, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "In the fast-changing realm of natural language processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational, showcasing impressive skill across diverse tasks.

This lack of clarity can lead to unintended outcomes, such as generating harmful or misleading content (Gehman et al., 2020) and model hallucinations (Weidinger et al., 2021). These challenges highlight the urgent need for better explainability, which is crucial not only for comprehension but also for responsible and ethical use. Explainability in LLMs serves two essential roles. For end users, it builds trust by elucidating the model's reasoning in simple terms, improving their understanding of its capabilities and limitations (Zhao et al., 2023). For developers and researchers, it reveals unintended biases and areas for enhancement, acting as a tool to boost the model's performance in subsequent tasks (Bastings et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023b).\n\nHowever, the sheer scale of LLMs presents unique challenges to explainability. Larger models with more parameters and extensive training data are more difficult to interpret. Traditional explanation methods such as SHAP values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) become less practical for these large-scale models (Zhao et al., 2023). Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of LLM-specific phenomena, including in-context learning (Halawi et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), along with addressing issues such as model hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023) and inherent biases (dev, 2023; An and Rudinger, 2023; Schick et al., 2021), is vital for ongoing refinement in model design.\n\nIn this survey, we focus on explainability methods for pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs, often termed as base models.

If you use a grinder, remember to wear a mask and goggles to protect yourself from inhaling or getting glass particles in your eyes. Grind away gently and patiently to avoid chipping any of the pieces. Reposition the pieces along the pattern to grind the glass into corrective lines, ensuring a perfect fit when assembling your project. Building a frame around the pieces after grinding will help prevent them from slipping as you proceed to foil the glass.\n\nCover the edges of each glass piece with 7/32 inch copper foil, centering it carefully to avoid an unbalanced appearance. You can apply the foil by hand or use a table foiler for consistency. After choosing the foil thickness, peel off the protective backing and center the glass on the tape, pressing it securely along all cut edges. Use a tongue depressor or another firm instrument to press the foil down hard, ensuring it adheres well to the glass. Ensure the tape is evenly applied; if it bunches up, remove it and start again.\n\nWhile flux isn't absolutely necessary, it does facilitate the solder flow between copper-taped pieces and makes the process smoother. Brush each copper-foiled surface with flux before soldering. The gel form is easy and forgiving, though liquid flux is also an option. Soldering takes time and patience, requiring several steps for a proper finish. First, tack the pieces together by applying small dots of flux to the desired areas and melting small solder blobs on top. Once all pieces are tacked, tin the seams by adding flux and applying a thin, flat layer of solder over them, ensuring the copper foil is fully coated. Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a generous amount of solder to create a smooth bead. Running your soldering iron back and forth over the seams will help achieve this. Framing your piece isn't mandatory, but it adds a polished finish. You can use a zinc frame or lead channel, which involves additional soldering steps similar to those outlined above.", "scores": {"ppl": 38.123966217041016, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.1019833087921143, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}}
{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Sentiment analysis has received considerable attention over the years in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its profound value in both academic research and industry applications, enabling researchers to better understand public opinions and emotions expressed through text, which can be leveraged to drive business decisions, improve customer experience, and inform policy-making. Traditionally, studies in sentiment analysis had been mostly focused on high-resource languages such as English due to a deficit of annotated data in other low-resource languages, but recent research has emerged to address this issue by leveraging machine translation to augment data resources, thereby reducing the language barrier and expanding the scope of sentiment analysis to a broader range of languages, including low-resource languages like Spanish, French, and Chinese (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2020) (Joshi et al., 2020). gpt-3-5-turbo Besides the research efforts in producing multilingual datasets for sentiment analysis, multilingual model architectures have become increasingly popular since the introduction of multilingual pretrained language models such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), mT5 (Xue et al., 2021), BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022), and other models like Marian (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2020) and ProphetNet (Wang et al., 2020), which have demonstrated impressive performance in cross-lingual transfer and few-shot learning tasks, enabling researchers to explore new avenues for multilingual sentiment analysis. Such multilingual pre-trained language models exploit the power of large-scale unsupervised textual data from a mixture of many languages, facilitating zero-shot and few-shot crosslingual transfer from a source to a target language on different downstream NLP tasks, albeit with varying performance outcomes, highlighting the need for further research to address the limitations of these models, such as their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and the potential for overfitting to specific languages or domains (Lauscher et al., 2020). More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama-3 (2024) have collected immense attention for their unparalleled performance in text generation, which can be leveraged for sentiment analysis tasks, including the detection of emotional tone, sentiment polarity, and other aspects of text, and have shown the potential for few-shot in-context learning, enabling models to learn from a small number of examples in the target language and generalize to new, unseen texts (GPT-3). (Zhang et al., 2023) shows the strong capability of LLMs with few-shot in-context learning in public English sentiment analysis tasks, demonstrating the potential for these models to outperform traditional machine learning approaches and human annotators in certain tasks, but also highlighting the limitations of these models, such as their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and their potential for bias and overfitting. Although most of the LLMs are pre-trained using corpora with a dominant presence of English, some research has found interesting multilinguality in both public and proprietary LLMs, such as the ability to learn and generalize to multiple languages, including low-resource languages, and the potential for these models to be fine-tuned for specific languages or domains, but also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of multilinguality for sentiment analysis (Qin et al., 2024) (Zhu et al., 2023). Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, the capability of cross-lingual transfer in these LLMs has not been fully studied for sentiment analysis tasks, and it is still unclear how LLMs stand in comparison to existing multilingual pre-trained models in the cross-lingual transfer paradigm, which is critical for building robust and generalizable sentiment analysis systems that can handle the complexities of language and culture. In this work, we examine a variety of pre-trained models and conduct a comprehensive study on the cross-lingual transfer capability in utterance-level sentiment analysis tasks with human speech transcripts, involving a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of different models, including SMLMs and LLMs, and an evaluation of their performance on a range of tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer. We classify our candidate public pre-trained models into two categories: Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLMs) such as XLM-R and mT5, and more recent Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focused on English such as Llama-3 (2024) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), which have demonstrated impressive performance in cross-lingual transfer and few-shot learning tasks, but also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of these models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. In addition, we also include benchmarking with proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), which is widely considered as the best LLM in terms of general capability, but also highlighting the limitations of these models, including their reliance on large amounts of data and computational resources, and the potential for bias and overfitting. To avoid potential data contamination introduced in the pre-training process of recent LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023), we curate and annotate proprietary sentiment datasets from in-house human conversation transcripts, and assess cross-lingual sentiment analysis from English to three target languages: Spanish, French, and Chinese, which requires a detailed understanding of the complexities of language and culture, and the development of robust and generalizable sentiment analysis systems. Our evaluation results show that with the same supervised fine-tuning, SMLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capability even with much fewer model parameters, which is critical for building efficient and scalable sentiment analysis systems that can handle the complexities of language and culture, and also highlighting the need for further research to understand the implications of these models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. However, public LLMs exhibit rapid improvement in few-shot crosslingual transfer scenarios and can surpass the performance of SMLMs when additional samples in the target language are provided, which highlights the potential for these models to be fine-tuned for specific languages or domains, but also requiring careful consideration of the limitations and biases of these models. Our contributions of this research can be summarized in the following dimensions: (1) the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the cross-lingual transfer capability of pre-trained models in sentiment analysis tasks, (2) the demonstration of the superior performance of SMLMs in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer scenarios, and (3) the identification of the limitations and biases of LLMs and the need for further research to understand their implications for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 27.054046630859375, "some": 0.8924694061279297, "bart": -1.6208211183547974, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology marks a monumental advancement in the digital and computational intelligence era, fundamentally altering how machines comprehend and produce content that mimics human communication. In recent years, the development of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) has propelled significant progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across diverse sectors, including telecommunications. These models can encapsulate information characteristics and transform extensive knowledge into tokens, aiding or even replacing human capabilities in conceptual understanding, logical reasoning, and decision-making. Language models have set new benchmarks on numerous NLP tasks, showcasing remarkable algorithmic, reasoning, and analytical abilities even without extensive domain-specific modifications. This capability enables the efficient execution of network tasks through natural language interactions. Consequently, optimizing the performance of networking-tailored LLMs presents a crucial challenge. Huang et al. underscored the potential applications of LLMs within the networking sector, indicating their transformative potential in network design by analyzing large datasets to assist in equipment selection and network planning. Furthermore, they can significantly aid in network diagnosis by utilizing status data to generate fault reports and offer processing recommendations. For network configuration, LLMs could furnish a unified natural language interface, streamlining management across various network devices. Additionally, LLMs can integrate with diverse security tools and systems, enhancing security assessments and intrusion detection processes. Addressing these specialized challenges with LLMs requires applying NLP tasks such as classification, summarization, question-answering, named entity recognition, and relation extraction. However, a significant obstacle is the scarcity of high-quality datasets in this domain necessary for training language models. To tackle this issue, Bariah et al. proposed a framework for adapting pre-trained generative models like BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 specifically for the telecom sector. They demonstrated these fine-tuned models' efficiency in classifying 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technical documents into pertinent telecom categories and working groups. Another noteworthy contribution is the SPEC5G dataset proposed by Karim et al., designed for tasks like security-related text classification and summarization, aiming to enhance understanding and analysis of complex 5G network protocols. In a practical contribution to this research domain, Maatouk et al. introduced TeleQnA, a benchmark dataset intended to assess LLMs' knowledge in telecommunications. Moreover, Miao et al. developed the NetEval question-answering dataset, focusing on network configurations, logs, and events. While supervised fine-tuned language models or zero-shot LLMs have delivered impressive results in specific telecommunications tasks, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities and limitations across this domain remains largely unaddressed. Toward this end, we explore the efficacy of LLMs in simulating typical NLP tasks in telecommunications research, such as text classification, summarization, and question-answering. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to deepen our understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations within telecommunications, paving the way for developing new applications leveraging LLMs in this domain. The primary contributions of this study are: a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of various LLMs in the telecommunications domain, revealing their strengths and limitations across multiple tasks; and a detailed error analysis, along with observations on specific areas needing enhancement for each task.", "scores": {"ppl": 78.06781005859375, "some": 0.8794473012288412, "bart": -1.7063510417938232, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

He was hit by a drunk driver whose four-wheel drive pickup smashed into the driver's side of my brother's small Toyota, killing him instantly. My brother was only 20 years old, still studying at college and had barely begun to live his life. My youngest brother was the baby of the family, being the youngest of five. He was the only brother and was especially cherished by his four older sisters. He was a studious, giving, caring person who always tried to do the right thing. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He made time to stay in touch with our parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family, and none of us know how to deal with the pain and hurt. We are close, but living in the same town doesn't seem to make things any easier. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying, and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents, but it's been a challenging job since we're all struggling as well. My sisters and I can offer each other support, and at least lend a listening ear. We're still navigating this difficult time, and I'm not sure if my family will ever fully recover from the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved hiking, canoeing, and camping.

Here's a revised version of the text, maintaining the specified constraints:\n\n---\n\nEither purchase sand at your local craft or hardware store, or gather some from a nearby beach. If collecting sand from a beach, be wary of hazardous materials and waste. Though you will later sift the sand, try to pick out noticeable things like paper or large pebbles. Be very careful when collecting sand from a beach. Use rubber gloves as there may be broken glass or other hazardous materials. Store gathered sand in tightly sealed plastic bags. Hold the bags upside down and see if any sand leaks out. This will help you reduce unwanted sand in your car and house. Store-bought sand will be smooth and even, but beach sand often has rocks that need to be separated from the sand grains. Place a bucket on the ground and put a sifter over top. This sifter could be an old sifter from the kitchen or fine netting, like a window screen, that is secured over the bucket using duct tape. If you are using a metal sifter from the kitchen, do not use it again for food-related preparation. Pour the collected sand onto the mesh of the sifter or screen. Shake the screen lightly so the sand will filter through into the bucket. You may need to occasionally clear the mesh of any stones, shells, or other debris. Continue this process until all the sand has been sifted. You can use plastic containers with lids or plastic storage bags. Storage bags are best because they will require less cleanup and will reduce any additional mess caused during the stirring process. Baking dishes and bowls are also acceptable containers. Be sure to thoroughly scrub any kitchenware afterward, especially if dying gathered sand. You want to avoid leaving behind any sand or potentially hazardous materials in the sand. This will help evenly distribute the dye when you apply it later. Aim for a damp consistency and avoid soaking or submerging the sand completely. Don't worry if you add too much water; this will simply make the drying process longer. Any kind of dye will work for this project, but fabric dye seems to produce the most vibrant dyed sand. Food coloring is also acceptable for dying sand. You may need to add dye several times until it gets to the desired shade you like. The sand will dry lighter so do not worry if the dye is very dark. Dry tempera paint powder is a nice additive that helps create bright colors. Tempera powder can be purchased in most arts and crafts stores. Be cautious while handling dye as it can stain skin, clothing, and furniture. This process will vary depending on what container you have used to separate sand. If you are using a container with a lid, you will need a plastic spoon that you can throw away after you finish the project. Scrape the sides of the container to make sure you color everything. Seal the container and set the wet sand to the side to soak up the dye for at least an hour. For a storage bag, simply seal the bag tightly and massage the sand until the color is consistent throughout. Set the bag aside for at least an hour so the sand can soak up the dye. Pour out any excess water first, then spread your damp sand on a plate or flat surface. Leave the sand to dry, preferably in a sunny place, for a few hours. You may wish to put paper towels over the plate before putting the sand down to help soak up any excess dye. You can also bake the sand to help speed up the drying process and further infuse the colors. Simply place the sand in a baking pan and bake on 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) for 15 minutes. Make sure you pull the sand out of the oven while it is still damp and let it dry naturally overnight; sand that has been baked completely dry can have faded and less vibrant colors. Once your dyed sand has completely dried, store it in dry plastic containers with easily sealed lids. For safety purposes, store sealed sand outside of the kitchen. You don't want to accidentally mistake it for a spice or cooking powder. Make sure you reseal the lids tightly after each sand art project. This will keep unwanted materials from ruining the color as well as prevent accidental spills inside the house.\n\n--- \n\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving fluency and adhering to the token and sentence length constraints.", "scores": {"ppl": 49.15751647949219, "some": 0.9279608726501465, "bart": -6.082764625549316, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}
{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Career success does not have to be defined rigidly, while many people associate it with measurable qualities, such as a high salary and professional ranking. There are, however, many other ways to define success based on personal goals. Part of what makes it difficult to precisely define career success is that numerous factors are at play, including relationships with coworkers, a good reputation in your field, a competitive salary, excellent benefits, and more. These factors can vary greatly from one person to another and can be influenced by a person's individual circumstances and priorities. A lot of people feel overwhelmed by the many factors that influence their sense of success, leading to stress and uncertainty about their career path. For instance, someone may feel pressure from their family to pursue a certain career, even if it does not align with their personal goals or passions. To avoid feeling stressed about traditional measures of success, try viewing your career success in a personal manner, focusing on what brings you fulfillment and happiness. This means prioritizing your own goals, values, and aspirations over external expectations or pressures. Much of success is unfortunately beyond our control, including factors like family background, upbringing, and random events. For example, someone may have grown up in a low-income household and therefore may not have had access to the same educational opportunities as someone from a more affluent background. You need to accept that there are various definitions of success and what truly matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment. By focusing on your own goals and aspirations, you can create a more fulfilling career that brings you happiness and satisfaction. If you're looking to define success, start by identifying your priorities and passions, and consider how they align with your career goals. For example, someone who is passionate about helping others may find success in a career in the non-profit sector. When considering your career goals, ask yourself: What did you want to be when you grew up? What were your goals in college? Are you currently using your degree, and if not, why not? Breaking down your goals into these three areas can help you gain clarity on what you want to achieve in your career. Oftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose sight of their true passions and interests, leading to feelings of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. This can happen when someone takes a job for financial stability or security, rather than pursuing their true passions. Conversely, people who feel stressed about their career often feel successful when they realize their work truly reflects their passion and purpose. This can be a powerful motivator for people who feel stuck in their current career. Don't be afraid to change and redefine your career path; sometimes, identifying your passions can help you create a more fulfilling and successful life. For example, someone who always wanted to be a teacher but has been working in marketing may consider returning to school for a master's in education. If you always wanted to be a teacher but have been working in marketing, you might consider returning to school for a master's in education. This can help you achieve your long-term goal of becoming a teacher and making a meaningful impact on your students. In some cases, you may be able to teach with just an undergraduate education, such as by attending a community college or obtaining a certification. For example, a person may be able to earn a teaching certification through a certification program at a community college. What matters most to you in a career? Do you crave prestige and honor, or do you prioritize making a difference and helping others? Breaking down your priorities into these two areas can help you gain clarity on what you want to achieve in your career. Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you, such as by working in a non-profit or healthcare field? Consider how your values and passions align with your career goals and aspirations. There is no one 'right' way to define success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you as an individual can help you define success and create a more fulfilling career. By focusing on your own goals and aspirations, you can create a career that brings you happiness and satisfaction. It's essential to avoid outside definitions of success, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. For example, comparing yourself to others on social media can create unrealistic expectations and lead to feelings of inadequacy. Research shows that the happiest, most fulfilled people across all careers are those who define success based on personal goals, passions, and desires. By focusing on your own goals and aspirations, you can create a more fulfilling career that brings you happiness and satisfaction. Try writing down your definition of success and placing it somewhere you can see it each day, such as on a vision board or sticky note. This can help you stay motivated and focused on your path to success. Reminding yourself of your goals can help you stay motivated and focused on your path to success, such as by setting daily or weekly reminders. For example, setting a reminder on your phone to review your goals each morning can help you stay on track and motivated throughout the day.", "scores": {"ppl": 16.406917572021484, "some": 0.8728515972462737, "bart": -2.9287363346232924, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Practice makes perfect, especially in spray painting. Before showing your tag to the world, practice in private. Get comfortable with spray-painting in a place where mistakes aren't embarrassing. Use a canvas you can paint over without legal issues, like a large canvas, plywood, or your own wall. Your tag should look fluid and dynamic, regardless of size. Quick movements are essential to keep lines neat, so avoid stiffness and cramps. Warm up your entire body before beginning. Your waist, hips, legs, and feet impact your work's quality. Covering large areas requires a wide range of motion. Larger surfaces mean you'll need to reach, lean, and bend frequently.\n\nRemember, paint ingredients separate over time. Shake the can vigorously before use, even after short breaks. Check the can\u2019s instructions for shaking times before the first use and after pauses. Without shaking, the paint\u2019s consistency will vary, leading to weak coats or clogs. If you attach a separate spray cap, expect some paint release. Keep away from the canvas to avoid spray-back. Use your finger or tape over the nozzle to catch excess paint. Be aware that many paints contain toxic ingredients. Even non-toxic paints should not be inhaled or ingested. Wear gloves and a mask for protection.\n\nBefore attempting your tag, start with simple lines at different distances. Assess the effect of your proximity to the canvas. Standing farther results in wider dispersal, while crisp lines require close work. For fades and shadows, you need more distance. Paint dries instantly upon contact, so prolonged spraying leads to wet buildup. To prevent drips, keep the can moving constantly, especially for thin lines. Experiment with motion and speed to see different effects on your lines. Constant motion is crucial, particularly when tagging without permission. Once confident in your skills, choose where to apply them. Resist tagging impulsively. Think before you act.\n\nConsider whether the area is already tagged; if so, choose somewhere else.

Expressions used in a language are said to be vague if they do not convey a precise meaning. Sentences using vague expressions do not give rise to precise truth conditions (Kennedy, 2007). Consider the following sentence: \u201cThe patient was maintained on a high dose of insulin.\u201d Interpreting such statements is a problem since it is unclear what was the exact amount of insulin that was used. Gradability (Sapir, 1944; Lyons, 1977) is a semantic property that allows a word to describe the intensity of a measure in context, and thus enables comparative constructs. In the above example, the word high is said to be gradable since it conveys the meaning associated with the measure\u2014amount. Gradable adjectives inherently possess a degree of vagueness and are used in a language to express epistemic uncertainties (Kennedy, 2007; Frazier et al., 2008). While judgments are strong in extreme cases, there exist borderline cases, where it is difficult to ascribe an adjective. In the above example, some amounts of insulin would be considered as a high dose by all, other amounts would never be considered a high dose, and there is a middle range where even experts may find it difficult to judge if it is a high dose because different experts may have differing thresholds for what constitutes a high dose. Broadly, gradable adjectives can be classified into two categories based on their interpretation as measure functions (Bartsch, 1975; Kennedy, 1999). Adjectives such as tall, heavy, and expensive can be viewed as measurements that are clearly associated with a numerical quantity (height, weight, cost). In contrast, adjectives like clever, beautiful, naive are more complex and underspecified for the exact feature being measured. Gradable adjectives have been the focus of several recent studies (de Melo and Bansal, 2013; Ruppenhofer et al., 2014) in the NLP community. Gradability is a property not limited to adjectives and also extends to other parts of speech such as adverbs (Shivade et al., 2015; Ruppenhofer et al.) (e.g., slightly, marginally), nouns (e.g., joy, euphoria), and also verbs (e.g., drizzling, pouring). In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in clinical text using a method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000), identifying the gradable adjectives in our dataset of clinical notes, finding that these adjectives are substantially present (30%) in our data, showing that there is a specific pattern in which gradable adjectives are used, with some medical concepts more likely to be modified by these adjectives than others, and focusing on a specific subset of gradable adjectives associated with measurements of numerical quantities, we demonstrate the use of a simple computational model to ground their meaning.", "scores": {"ppl": 24.631925582885742, "some": 0.8714354832967123, "bart": -2.071155309677124, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "In the vast and ever-evolving landscape of technology, staying ahead of the curve is crucial for both businesses and individuals. As new advancements constantly emerge, they bring with them opportunities and challenges that must be navigated thoughtfully. Whether it's the latest software development, hardware innovation, or a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, the pace of change is relentless, and keeping up requires dedication and agility.\n\nCompanies that can swiftly adapt to these changes are often the ones that thrive, leveraging new tools and techniques to enhance their operations and offer innovative solutions to their clients.

By harnessing the power of technology responsibly and ethically, we can work towards a future that is not only more advanced but also more equitable and sustainable.\n\nIn conclusion, the relentless march of technological progress presents both opportunities and obstacles. By staying informed, adaptable, and committed to lifelong learning, individuals and organizations can navigate this landscape effectively, reaping the rewards of innovation while mitigating its risks. The key lies in balancing the promise of technology with a mindful approach to its implementation, ensuring that its benefits are widely shared and its challenges thoughtfully addressed.\n\nExpressions used in a language are said to be vague if they do not convey a precise meaning. Sentences using vague expressions do not give rise to precise truth conditions (Kennedy, 2007).

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Since its official launch on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most popular intelligent chatbots, as noted by Van Dis et al. [2023], Stokel-Walker, and Van Noorden [2023]. Since its inception, ChatGPT has been used in various fields; for example, Surameery and Shakor [2023] applied it for code correction, Som S [2023] employed it in public health, and Biswas [2023] explored its applications in addressing global warming. In July 2023, OpenAI released the Code Interpreter plugin, enhancing ChatGPT\u2019s data parsing capabilities and addressing large language models' weaknesses in mathematics and language. These developments have inspired new methods for improving AI intelligence and generalization, particularly in intelligent wargame simulations, where ChatGPT-generated AI now makes informed decisions. Initially, rule-based AI and data-driven AI, as discussed by Cheng et al. [2021], were foundational in intelligent wargame research. Liu Man and Zhang Hongjun developed a wargame decision-making framework in data-driven AI that balances rules and data, as noted by Liu et al. [2020a]. In reinforcement learning AI, Li Chen\u2019s team from Nanjing University of Science and Technology designed a multi-agent decision-making method under the actor-critic framework, achieving notable outcomes, as noted by Chen et al. [2021]. Xu Jiale, Zhang Haidong, and their colleagues developed a CNN-based strategy learning model to improve the accuracy of wargame situation predictions, as described by Xu et al. [2022]. Tencent\u2019s AI Lab used deep reinforcement learning to succeed in the King\u2019s Glory game confrontations, defeating professional players, as documented by Ye et al. [2020] and Chen et al. [2020]. As deep learning, reinforcement learning, and intelligent wargames continue to integrate, the intelligence of agents has significantly improved, as indicated by Mnih et al. [2015], Silver et al. [2016], Vinyals et al. [2019], and Liu et al. [2020b]. While rule-based AI does not require extensive training, its intelligence is limited by its rules, whereas data-driven AI and reinforcement learning AI enhance their intelligence and flexibility by processing large data through reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the interpretability of these models is limited, making it challenging to transfer models across varying scenarios and capture points, as discussed by SUN et al. [2022], Wurman et al. [2022], Schrittwieser et al. [2020], and Silver et al. [2018]. Therefore, enhancing AI intelligence and generalization in intelligent wargames remains a key research focus. Furthermore, decision-making in adversarial games is both complex and continuous. To achieve more intelligent and generalized decisions, this article introduces a self-generated AI wargame architecture based on a large language model. It proposes a decision-making mechanism involving multiple generative agents that interact, mimic human behavior, and produce interpretable, credible, and highly generalizable intelligent decisions. The core contribution of this article is the self-generated AI wargame architecture, an intelligent agent framework centered on a large language model. This architecture comprises multiple generative agents, each powered by its own large language model, with ChatGPT as the driving tool. These intelligent agents communicate and cooperate through reflective and memory streams to collectively make decisions. By conversing, they share information, analyze situations, and make inferences and decisions based on their discussions. The model includes a two-layer agent task planning structure targeting strategic and tactical agents to plan tasks for game confrontations. Strategic agents describe specific situations observed by all current agents and involve task allocation and execution based on all observed situational information. The tactical agent focuses on the situation observed by a single chess piece agent and executes tasks according to the plans of the strategic agent. Additionally, tactical agents can make independent judgments and provide feedback in response to prompts from strategic agents. Using wargames as an experimental platform, experiments demonstrate that the large language model's intelligent decision-making capability surpasses that of reinforcement learning AI and rule-based AI, with improvements in intelligence, understandability, and generalization.

I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. Since I don't see him often, I make the most of it when I do. Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents, who are very important to me, were there as well. I was overwhelmed by the number of people present and felt as loved and important as ever because of them. The only downside was that, with so many guests, I didn't get as much time to chat with each person as I would have liked. I've come to realize that's simply how weddings are, with many people and limited time; it's just part of the experience. Beyond that, it was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed myself greatly. My wife looked gorgeous (as usual), and I am extremely thankful to spend the rest of my life with her.

Many people feel they've lost the true spirit of Christmas, largely due to its over-commercialization, which has drained the joy from this festive time. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Regardless of your reason for celebrating, nothing dampens the holiday spirit faster than being caught in a frenzied crowd of bargain-hunters. Instead, consider shopping at local stores. Many items in malls and big box stores are mass-produced and lack quality. Giving such gifts can feel as empty as being part of a shopping mob.\n\nThere are many meaningful gifts outside the commercial realm: handmade jewelry, artisan foods like meats, breads, and cheeses, or charitable gifts made in the recipient's name. You can also give something you create yourself, whether it's a hand-knit sweater, a piece of art, or a delicious meal. Reflect on your skills and offer a piece of that as a gift. Think back to your best Christmas memories. Perhaps it was when Santa brought you a bike as a child, or the Christmas Eve when you got engaged. Consider what made it special and how it felt. If it was the sense of wonder and kindness, seek out places where that spirit thrives. If it's the joy on children's faces, find the best Santa in town and immerse yourself in the magic.\n\nKeep a smile on your face, walk with your head held high, and make eye contact. Greet everyone with a cheerful \"Merry Christmas,\" even if it feels insincere at first. With time and effort, it will become genuine. Whether you have a house full of kids or are celebrating alone, embrace the season's trappings. If you can, go to the hills to harvest a tree. If not, visit a local lot filled with trees. Get one a couple of weeks before Christmas, play some holiday music, and decorate it. The scent of the tree will fill your home with Christmas cheer. Hang a wreath on your front door to welcome you home with festive spirit.\n\nConnect with loved ones through Christmas cards, phone calls, or video chats if they're far away. If you use Skype or Google Hangouts, position your Christmas tree in the background, all lit up. Enjoy holiday movies, whether you prefer classics like \"Miracle on 34th Street\" or \"A Christmas Carol,\" modern takes like \"Scrooged,\" or cult favorites like \"A Christmas Story.\" These films offer nostalgia, humor, and simple entertainment. Indulge in seasonal treats like candy canes, eggnog, pumpkin pies, and roasted foods.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "EQs can be an incredible tool to focus the sound of your instruments, allowing you to either strip or boost high or low frequencies, which can be particularly useful with drum kits. When drum kit sounds are recorded, the vibrations caused by its low frequencies can resonate with other parts of the kit. This might cause a rumble in the kit's snare, for example. These sounds can be 'rolled off' at the low end with an EQ, creating a purer sound. Snare drums generally sound more powerful with a boost in the lower frequencies, while hi-hats and toms often sound snappier and punchier with their higher frequencies thinned out. A compressor limits the range of volume in your mix by raising the volume of quiet parts and lowering the volume of loud parts. It also maintains the volume of sounds within your ideal range. Due to human error, you can expect that no single instrument will be perfectly constant throughout an entire recording, but compression can automatically smooth these irregularities for you. Drums and bass form the rhythmic foundation of your song, so be sure you set aside some time to give these a careful listen, as lower frequency sounds can be overpowering if you're not careful, and every part should sound distinct yet cohesive with the whole. If one instrument is excessively bright or dark, it will sound out of place, so think of the tracks of your mix as members of a choir: each part is separately appreciable, but its goal is to work together as a collective. Noise gates eliminate all noise that doesn't reach a minimum volume, which can be highly useful when a recording has been done in an area with background noise. The buzz of this noise can easily be cut out with a gate, and for specific instruments that don't occur regularly in your mix, it may be easiest to adjust their fader separately. Experiment with noise gates to get a cleaner, crisper sound from your mix while considering how sound moves through the stereo field, which significantly affects the sound you produce. To find the perfect balance, beginners should experiment with how they distribute their tracks, starting with a centered bass part and then alternating sides with rhythm guitar and percussion. Place a keyboard track so it is slightly off-center, and add other tracks throughout the field to give your mix a richer, more realistic quality. The chorus effect, for example, adds layers of slightly different timbres and intonations to a track, making it sound like multiple instruments are playing. As a general rule, this effect is useful for electric keyboards and guitar parts, and some other effects you might use while mixing include reverb, which adds a sense of space to the sound and is often applied to guitars and voice to mask less desirable frequencies and create fullness. Delay, sometimes called 'echo,' creates one or more defined sound segments and repeats them, and there are many different kinds of automation you can use to improve the musicality of your mix. For example, you might automate your master bus to create louder choruses than your verses, resulting in a more prominent chorus in your mix, and you can also automate effects returns, which is useful if you want a reverb or a delay to be less prominent in certain sections of a song. While you're using your EQ, noise gates, and other effects, you should constantly be listening to your entire production, making small adjustments to each track while always keeping the whole in mind. With each change, listen to your mix anew because even if individual parts sound great, the complete product has to sound great as well.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The title can provide significant clues about the nature of the poem by hinting at the poem's subject, suggesting the emotional and intellectual journey within, and offering insights into the poem's meaning and the speaker's role. Read the title and consider how it relates to the rest of the poem by examining its connection to themes and tone, reflecting on the imagery, language, and how they resonate throughout the poem. Consider how the title influences the poem's meaning in relation to its themes and tone, as this can provide insight into the overall message by highlighting key motifs or emotions. How does the title contribute to the poem's themes and overall meaning? In some cases, the title may identify the speaker or intended audience, such as in poems like 'For Mother' or 'To My Lover,' which can provide insight into the poem's themes and tone. Alternatively, the title may describe the poem's subject, genre, or tone, such as in sonnets like 'Sonnet 18' or in poems like 'Digging,' which can provide context for the poem's themes and meaning. The poet and the speaker are not always the same person, as the poet may choose a speaker to convey different perspectives or emotions, creating a more complex narrative. In a poem, the speaker may be a character within the broader context, offering readers a unique perspective and enhancing their understanding. Determine the speaker's perspective, whether it's first person (I), second person (you), or third person (she, he, they). In most cases, the speaker's perspective is clear, but if you're unsure, it's okay to move on for now. When analyzing the poem's meaning, make sure you understand the speaker's perspective. When you encounter an unfamiliar word, pause and look it up in a dictionary to gain a deeper understanding of its meaning. You can mark these words in the text by circling or underlining them to help you remember to look them up later. Understanding unfamiliar words can significantly enhance your comprehension of the poem's meaning, themes, and tone, as well as its overall impact. You can also explore synonyms for the word in a thesaurus to gain a deeper understanding of its meaning, nuances, connotations, and associations. Once you've defined the word, incorporate its meaning or a synonym into the poem and re-read the line to see how it affects your understanding of the poem. You can apply this same approach to phrases or proper nouns you're unfamiliar with, and be prepared to conduct additional research if necessary to gain a deeper understanding. The tone and mood of the poem are often shaped by the poet's choice of words, language, and other literary devices, such as imagery, symbolism, and metaphor, which can create a specific atmosphere or mood. You can also gauge the poem's mood and tone by paying attention to the rhythms, cadence, and other sound devices, such as alliteration and assonance, when you read it aloud. For instance, consider a poem like 'Dirty Face' by Shel Silverstein, which has a lighthearted tone and a playful mood, demonstrating how tone and mood can be used to convey meaning and create a specific effect. Alternatively, you might encounter a poem with a darker, more ominous tone, like 'The Raven' by Edgar Allan Poe, which explores themes of death, loss, and mortality, creating a haunting and atmospheric effect that adds to the poem's overall impact. Try to understand the historical, cultural, and literary contexts in which the poem was written, as they can provide valuable insights into its meaning and themes. Consider how historical events, literary trends, and cultural influences might have impacted the poem's creation, interpretation, and meaning, and how they relate to the poet's intentions and artistic vision. The poet may have been inspired by various forms of art, music, or other creative works when writing the poem, and these influences can be seen in the poem's language, themes, and literary devices. Understanding the poem's context can provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of its meaning and themes, as well as its historical and cultural significance. You can conduct research on the poem's context using a variety of sources, including academic texts, online resources, scholarly journals, and other relevant materials, to gain a deeper understanding of its historical and cultural significance. Consider the poem's publication date and how it reflects the literary and cultural trends of its time, as well as its contribution to the broader literary and cultural landscape. Poets frequently use repetition and patterns to emphasize specific themes or ideas, and to create a sense of rhythm, musicality, and emotional resonance in the poem, as well as to convey a particular mood or atmosphere. The poet may use a repeated line or phrase, like a refrain, to emphasize a key idea or theme, creating a sense of continuity, coherence, and depth, as well as a sense of rhythm and musicality in the poem. Alternatively, the poet may use word patterns or organizational structures to convey a specific meaning or tone, creating a sense of depth, complexity, and nuance, as well as a sense of rhythm and musicality in the poem. Consider whether the poet frequently uses certain images, themes, or word choices to create a specific effect, and to convey a particular mood or atmosphere, such as a sense of wonder or unease. Identify clusters of similar words that suggest a pattern or theme in the poem, and consider how they contribute to the poem's overall meaning and message, as well as its tone and mood. Consider how a repeated line, like 'only this and nothing more,' might reinforce a theme or idea in the poem, creating a sense of emphasis and importance, and contributing to the poem's overall meaning, impact, and emotional resonance. Think about why the poet chose to repeat this phrase, and how it contributes to the poem's meaning, themes, and overall message. In many cases, the repeated phrase will be connected to a key theme or idea in the poem, reinforcing the poem's overall message and meaning, and creating a sense of cohesion and unity, as well as a deeper emotional resonance. Think about how the poet organizes ideas in the poem, such as in chronological order or by theme, and how it affects the overall meaning, interpretation, and impact of the poem, as well as its emotional resonance. Does the poem follow a chronological order, progressing from the present to the future, or does it employ a non-linear structure, such as a non-chronological narrative or a fragmented narrative? Alternatively, the ideas might jump around in time, moving between past, present, and future, creating a non-linear narrative structure that adds complexity, depth, and nuance to the poem, as well as emotional resonance. Think about whether the poem employs a non-chronological structure, such as a collection of fragmented thoughts or a focus on a specific theme, and how it contributes to the poem's overall meaning, impact, and emotional resonance, as well as its overall message and cohesion. For instance, consider a poem that explores a specific theme, such as water, with the poet describing different aspects of the theme throughout the poem, creating a rich, nuanced, and multifaceted exploration of the theme, and adding depth and complexity to the poem. Alternatively, the poem might explore a theme of lost love, with each stanza delving into a different moment or aspect of the speaker's experience, creating a complex, multifaceted, and emotionally resonant exploration of the theme, and adding emotional depth and resonance to the poem. After analyzing the poem's form and content, distill its meaning into a clear, concise, and compelling summary that captures its essence and significance, as well as its overall message and theme. Write down your interpretation of the poem's central theme or idea, and be sure to support it with evidence from the text, as well as your own personal responses, insights, and experiences. Base your interpretation on a close reading of the poem's language, structure, and themes, as well as your own personal responses, insights, and experiences, and consider multiple perspectives and interpretations, as well as the poem's literary devices and techniques. Consider the poem's subject or theme, and how it is explored through the poet's use of language, literary devices, and other creative techniques, such as imagery, symbolism, and metaphor, which can create a specific atmosphere or mood. For instance, consider a poem like 'The Raven' by Edgar Allan Poe, which explores the speaker's fear of death through the raven's presence, creating a haunting and atmospheric effect that adds to the poem's overall impact and emotional resonance, as well as its overall message and cohesion. Keep in mind that there's no one 'right' interpretation of the poem, and your understanding is just as valid and valuable as anyone else's, as long as you support it with evidence and analysis. Poetry is inherently subjective, and your interpretation is just as valid, valuable, and meaningful as anyone else's, as long as you support it with evidence and analysis, and consider multiple perspectives and interpretations. You have the freedom to interpret the poem in a way that resonates with you, as long as you base your interpretation on a close reading of the poem's language, themes, and literary devices, and consider multiple perspectives and interpretations, as well as the poem's cultural and historical context. By considering multiple perspectives and using evidence from the poem, you can gain a more comprehensive, nuanced, and insightful understanding of its themes, meanings, literary devices, and cultural significance. By taking a thoughtful and nuanced approach to interpreting the poem, you'll cultivate a more meaningful and personal connection with the poem, its themes, literary devices, and creator, fostering a lifelong appreciation and respect for poetry.", "scores": {"ppl": 18.705150604248047, "some": 0.8643344243367513, "bart": -2.3840203285217285, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "The title of a poem can offer significant clues about its nature, so it should not be overlooked. Begin by reading the title and considering its implications within the context of the entire poem. Ask yourself, what does the poem mean in relation to its title? How does the title enhance the overall meaning of the poem? Sometimes, the title may indicate the speaker or the intended audience, such as in poems titled \u201cFor Mother\u201d or \u201cTo My Lover.\u201d Other times, it might describe the subject, genre, or tone, like \u201cSonnet 18\u201d or \u201cDigging.\u201d It's important to remember that the poet and the speaker are not always the same person. The speaker might be a character within the poem's broader context. Note whether the poet uses a first-person speaker (\u201cI\u201d), a second-person speaker (\u201cyou\u201d), or a third-person speaker (\u201cshe, he, they\u201d). Identifying the speaker usually doesn't require deep analysis, but if you're unsure, don't worry for now. Just ensure you understand the type of speaker when you begin analyzing the poem's meaning.\n\nWhen you encounter a word you don't understand, pause and look up its meaning in a dictionary. You might circle or underline these words to remind yourself to look them up later. Defining unfamiliar words can deepen your understanding of the poem. You might also want to find synonyms for these words using a thesaurus. After defining a word, insert its definition or synonym into the poem and re-read the line with that meaning. This practice can also be applied to phrases or proper nouns you don't know, though defining these elements might require additional research in other texts or online. The tone and mood of a poem are often created by the poet's word choice and language. You can also sense the poem's mood and tone by listening to its rhythms when read aloud. For instance, a poem might have a humorous tone and a light mood, like \u201cDirty Face\u201d by Shel Silverstein. Alternatively, a poem might convey a more sinister or ominous tone, such as \u201cThe Raven\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nUnderstanding when and why a poem was written, or its context, is crucial. Perhaps a historical event occurred around the time the poem was written, or a particular style of poetry was popular when it was published. The poet might have been influenced by a painting or art performance when writing the poem. Learning about the poem's context can deepen your understanding and provide a more thorough reading. You can research the poem's context using other texts, scholarly journals, or online sources. Consider when the poem was published and use this date to situate it within the history of poetry and writing. Patterns and repetition in a poem often reinforce a certain theme or idea. The poet might repeat a line throughout the poem, like a refrain, to remind the reader of a specific idea. Alternatively, they might use a pattern of words or organization to create meaning. Ask yourself if the poet consistently relies on certain images, topics, or similar words. Groups of similar words can indicate a pattern. For example, you might notice a repeated line, such as \u201conly this and nothing more.\u201d Consider why the poet repeats this phrase. Often, it relates back to a specific theme or idea in the poem.\n\nAnother pattern to look for is the order of ideas in the poem. Are they chronological, moving from present to future? Or do they jump around in time, moving from past to present to future and back again? You might also notice if the poem lacks time-based ordering and instead follows another organizing idea, like scraps of conversation or another theme. For example, a poem might have a water-based theme, with the poet describing an ocean in one line and a shallow pond in the next.

She may lean in close and rest her body against you, showing her interest. She'll find plenty of reasons for the two of you to be in constant contact, such as touching or talking to each other. She often flashes you a bright, genuine smile. She may catch your eye from across the room and offer a warm, genuine smile. She subtly draws attention to her body through her movements, such as biting her lip or adjusting her hair. She may engage in subtle behaviors, such as biting her lip or adjusting her hair. These subtle gestures often draw your attention to her. She reserves a special kind of hug just for you, showing her affection. If she's not a hugger, it's clear when she saves a special hug for you. This is a way for her to get closer to you and show her affection, making you feel special and valued. Even if you're unsure, appreciate the kind gesture and the fact that she's thinking of you. An interested girl may subtly hint at her feelings through her words or actions. Listening carefully to her words is crucial to understanding her true intentions. Even a simple 'hello' can have a seductive tone if she says it with a smile and a warm tone. She laughs at your jokes, even the ones that might not be hilarious to others. Your friends might chuckle at your jokes, but when she hears them, she's laughing out loud and seems genuinely amused. She wants you to feel special and valued, but don't confuse this with her feeling uncomfortable or trapped in the situation. She frequently praises you, often highlighting your positive qualities and making you feel good about yourself. She thinks you're hilarious, kind-hearted, and have a great sense of humor and style. Conversely, some girls might use playful insults as a classic flirting tactic, though it can lower your self-esteem. This is a classic flirting tactic used by many to lower the target's self-esteem and make them feel inferior. This tactic can sometimes make the target feel insecure, which might paradoxically make the person using it appear more appealing and attractive. Don't confuse this with a girl who's genuinely uninterested in you and is just being polite or friendly. Occasional light-hearted jabs are harmless, but if she consistently insults you, it's likely she's not genuinely interested in you. You might notice a significant change in her behavior when she is around you, such as becoming more outgoing or reserved. A change in behavior often indicates that she feels differently about you and may be interested in you. Observe her usual behavior when she's with her friends to get a sense of her personality and behavior. If possible, observe her behavior without her realizing you're watching her. See if she changes her behavior once she realizes you're looking at her and paying attention to her. She might stand up straight, become quiet and serious, or be extremely happy to see you and show her enthusiasm. Pay attention to how her friends behave around you and interact with you. If they're whispering, giggling, or sneaking glances at you, it's likely you're the topic of their conversation and they're interested in you and your relationship with her. Don't jump to conclusions if you notice a change in her behavior; it might mean she's playing hard to get or simply not interested. She might be playing hard to get or simply not genuinely interested in you. If you're still unsure, try playing along and see how she responds and what she says. Playing along can be effective if you suspect she is playing hard to get or is genuinely interested in you and wants to build a connection with you. Try flirting with her occasionally to keep things fresh and exciting. Keep her wondering if you're genuinely interested in her and what your intentions are. Playing this game can be enjoyable for both of you, keeping things exciting and fresh and allowing you to build a connection. Maintain an air of mystery to keep her interested and engaged in the game. Share subtle details about yourself to pique her interest and make her want to know more about you. This will make you appear more intriguing and attractive to her. Not all girls will appreciate this playful approach, especially if they're playing hard to get or are simply not interested in you. The idea behind playing hard to get is to encourage the person you're interested in to put in more effort and build a connection with you. Let her decide how to show you her interest and affection, and respond accordingly. The most disastrous approach is to become overly fixated and obsessed with winning her over.

In such cases, she usually sends out subtle signals that suggest she likes you. Deciphering whether a girl is flirting can be challenging, so it's crucial to pay attention to her body language for signs that might suggest flirtation. For instance, she might frequently find reasons to touch you. She could touch your shoulder or arm while engaging in conversation. Alternatively, she might lean in closer, allowing her body to rest gently against yours. You may notice several excuses or reasons for the frequent physical contact between the two of you.\n\nAnother sign to look out for is how often she smiles at you. She might catch your eye from across the room and flash a sweet, unsolicited smile. Additionally, she may draw attention to her body through subtle gestures. She might bite her lip, adjust her hair, or cross and uncross her legs. These actions, whether done consciously or unconsciously, are designed to draw attention to specific parts of her body. If she gives you special hugs, this is another clue. If she's generally not a hugger, you can tell when a hug is reserved especially for you. It serves as an excuse to get closer and is an affectionate expression. Even if you're unsure whether it's a special hug, appreciate the nice gesture from her.\n\nAn interested girl will often attempt to give subtle suggestions through her speech, so it's important to learn to read between the lines.

However, don't confuse this with awkward laughter, which might indicate discomfort.\n\nCompliments are another strong indicator. She might frequently tell you that you're funny, kind, or that you have nice hair. Some girls, however, might resort to the opposite tactic and tease or insult you lightly. This is an age-old flirting technique used by many to lower the self-esteem of the target while making the insulter seem more attractive. However, don't mistake this for a lack of interest; light-hearted teasing is harmless, but consistent hurtful insults likely mean she's not interested.\n\nA change in behavior around you can also be telling. Whether she becomes nervous, aloof, or overly flirtatious, a shift in behavior often signifies a change in how she feels about you. You can gauge her normal behavior by observing her around friends. If possible, watch her behavior when she doesn't know you're present. Notice if she changes once she realizes you're there. She might straighten up, become quiet, or seem very happy to see you. Also, pay attention to her friends' reactions around you. If they whisper, giggle, or sneak glances, it's likely you've been a topic of conversation.\n\nHowever, don't automatically assume that a change in behavior means she's interested. She could be playing hard to get or might genuinely not be interested. If you're still uncertain, you might consider engaging in a bit of playful flirting yourself. This strategy works well if you suspect she's playing hard to get or genuinely interested. Flirt sparingly, keeping her guessing about your true feelings. This approach can be fun and keep things fresh and entertaining for both of you.\n\nMaintain an air of mystery. Drop hints about yourself to keep her curious. Appearing intriguing can make you more attractive. However, be aware that not all girls will appreciate this approach, especially if she's the one playing hard to get. The goal of playing hard to get is often to encourage the person of interest to work harder, not less. Therefore, play by her rules and demonstrate how much you're willing to do to win her affection.\n\nUltimately, let her decide how to express her interest in you. Becoming obsessed with wanting to be with her is one of the worst things you can do. Such obsession can lead to unwanted behavior, including harassment. Always remember that no means no. If she rejects your advances or asks you to stop contacting her, respect her wishes and cease all attempts. It's crucial not to constantly ask her out or demand her attention.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "The task of machine comprehension concerns the automatic extraction of answers from a given passage. Often, the information needed to answer a question is spread across multiple sentences. Understanding the relation(s) between these sentences is key to finding the correct answer. Consider the example in Figure 1. To answer the question about why Sally put on her shoes, we need to infer that these actions are connected by a causality relation. Prior work has demonstrated the value of discourse relations in related applications such as question answering (Jansen et al., 2014). Traditionally, however, these approaches rely on outputs from off-the-shelf discourse analyzers. These outputs are used as features for target applications. These pipeline designs provide limited opportunities to guide the discourse parser based on the requirements of the end task. Given a wide spectrum of discourse frameworks (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Prasad et al., 2008; Wolf and Gibson, 2005), it is not clear a priori what the optimal set of discourse annotations is. In fact, the largest discourse treebanks are based on newspaper corpora (Prasad et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2002), which differ significantly in style from the text used in machine comprehension corpora (Richardson et al., 2013). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for incorporating discourse structure into machine comprehension applications. Rather than using a standalone parser trained on external supervised data, our model induces relations between sentences. This happens while optimizing for a task-specific objective. Unlike a generic discourse analyzer, our method can utilize additional information available in the machine comprehension context. The model predicts relations based not only on the sentences but also on information about the question. By decomposing the dependencies between model components, we can effectively train the model using a standard gradient descent approach. To answer the question about why Sally put on her shoes, we need to infer that Sally put on her shoes to go outside. We aim to enhance the model's ability to derive meaningful relations. Since the same set of sentences can give rise to multiple questions, we do not limit the model to a single discourse relation. Instead, the model can handle various relations.

During a fast break, players have the opportunity to sprint down the court, moving quickly and decisively. Players sprint down the court, where the physical demands require them to be in top shape to execute these plays effectively. Utilizing speed and agility, players must also make quick decisions to create scoring chances. This often happens before the defense can set up, making it challenging to guard against a player with a good jump shot. To exploit gaps in the defense, timing and coordination are crucial in fast breaks. Players must be in top shape, showcasing their speed, endurance, and agility. As they sprint down the court, speed and agility become essential in fast breaks. Often leading to quick scoring, taking advantage of these opportunities is vital. The effectiveness of a fast break hinges on precise timing and seamless coordination among players. Players quickly transition from defense to offense, emphasizing the importance of quick decision-making. Having a reliable jump shot can significantly boost their scoring potential. This demands exceptional physical fitness and stamina, as well as quick decision-making to keep the momentum alive. To sustain the pace, different types of shots can be executed, each requiring players to act swiftly. Timing and coordination are essential, emphasizing the need to take shots quickly and efficiently. As players must work together seamlessly, a pull-up jumper can be a valuable tool, providing balance and precision. Often leading to dynamic scoring opportunities, the pull-up jumper relies on balance and timing, adding a strategic layer to the player's skill set. As players must quickly assess whether to drive to the hoop or pass to an open teammate, ball control is crucial. As they must be in peak physical condition, having a reliable jump shot can open up numerous scoring opportunities. Quick decision-making is crucial to capitalize on scoring chances, allowing players to execute plays effectively. To sprint down the court and execute plays effectively, speed and agility are key. Mastering the pull-up jumper requires understanding proper footwork. Having a reliable jump shot can greatly enhance a player's scoring potential by keeping defenders off balance. Timing and coordination are crucial during fast breaks, and the pull-up jumper provides an advantage by allowing players to score from almost anywhere on the court. By keeping defenders off balance, players must quickly line up their shots and defend against challenging opponents. Defending against a player with a good jump shot can be particularly challenging, emphasizing the importance of proper shooting technique. And make them under pressure, players must take shots swiftly to maintain the momentum of a fast break. Instead, they either have to drive straight to the hoop or master the pull-up jumper technique to keep defenders guessing. Or opt for a jump shot immediately, where proper footwork is key to executing it successfully. When a player goes straight from running into making a jump shot, they gain the advantage of surprise against the defense. In one fluid motion, this is called a \"pull-up jumper.\" Once mastered, this skill is a valuable asset in a player's repertoire, offering strategic benefits by allowing players to score from almost anywhere on the court. Allowing players to score from almost anywhere on the court, balance and timing are crucial when executing a pull-up jumper. Without giving the defense time to react, proper shooting technique ensures a higher success rate. To make a pull-up jumper, start off by dribbling at a fast jog or run, emphasizing proper footwork to maintain momentum during the break. As you advance down the middle of the court, take shots quickly to prevent the defense from setting up. Use different movements to outmaneuver opponents, benefiting from the pull-up jumper to maintain offensive flow. As you near the free throw line, it becomes a strategic point to decide on the best shooting angle. Flare out a few feet to the side to explore various shooting angles and distances. Come to a balanced stop in rhythm with your steps, ensuring ball control as you prepare to shoot. Ensuring ball control as you bring the ball up into both hands, different ball-handling techniques can maintain the fast break's tempo. Without hesitating, immediately get low, making quick decisions crucial in maintaining the fast break's speed. Jump, and shoot, highlighting the importance of taking shots swiftly to maximize scoring opportunities. Practice until you can pull this move off quickly without stopping at any point. When you receive the ball off a pass and a defender is right behind you, there are options to outmaneuver the defender, like utilizing a quick shot or pass. It's crucial to anticipate the defender's moves, ensuring you stay a step ahead in the fast break. One way to get out of this situation is to use a technique called a turnaround shot, which can effectively create space and scoring opportunities. In a turnaround shot, the player with the ball pretends to go one way, emphasizing quick footwork, then spins in the opposite direction and shoots, taking the shot quickly keeps the defense off guard. As soon as he's facing the hoop, using a turnaround shot in fast breaks provides a strategic scoring option. Most of the time, this usually gives him a small window where varying shooting distances can be employed effectively to shoot without the defender blocking him. Taking the shot quickly ensures success against defensive pressure. To shoot a turnaround shot, start with your back to the hoop and a defender guarding you closely. Back towards the hoop as you dribble, maintaining low posture until you're at a comfortable shooting distance highlights the benefits of a turnaround shot in creating space. Take a step in the direction of your throwing hand, providing effective execution tips for the turnaround shot. As you drop your non-shooting foot back slightly, balance and timing are key to successful execution. Quickly pivot around on your non-shooting foot, utilizing different pivot types to maintain the fast break's rhythm. And make your jump shot immediately, ensuring it is quick to capitalize on the opportunity. Many of the NBA's all-time greatest players had masterful fadeaway jump shots. As their name hints at, having a reliable jump shot is crucial for success. Fadeaway shots are jump shots made when a player jumps and leans backward, which can effectively distance the ball from the defender. A fadeaway shot can effectively distance the ball from the defender, making it a valuable asset in fast breaks. This technique gives the shooter extra room to shoot, emphasizing the importance of quick shooting under pressure. Making it difficult for the defender to guard against, a good jump shot provides a significant advantage. However, mastering fadeaway shots requires practice and dedication and repetition, given their difficulty. Makes fadeaway shots a strategic choice in fast breaks. To make a fadeaway, begin with an ordinary jump shot or a turnaround shot, then push yourself upward and backward as you jump, creating space from the player behind you. Lean back with your spine for extra space, maintaining balance is crucial for successful execution. Square up with the hoop in the air, and hold the ball just above your head. When you reach the highest point of your jump, different jump types can be utilized effectively in fast breaks. Shoot the ball with a snapping motion of the wrist, emphasizing wrist strength for a successful fadeaway. Noting that fadeaways require much more wrist strength than ordinary shots because much of the leg power is spent propelling the shooter backward. An important part of having a great jump shot is knowing when not to shoot. By carefully interspersing your shots with the occasional fakeout, you can keep defenders on their toes. More importantly, a convincing fake can open up shooting opportunities when you're being guarded by a persistent defender. To make a pump fake, get low as you normally would just before taking a shot. Bring the ball up in front of you and prepare to jump. Start to rise up but stop yourself just short of actually jumping. If your defender falls for your fake and jumps, either quickly dart around him or time your own jump so that you shoot just as he's hitting the ground, giving yourself a free shot. It's important to stay in contact with the floor during your pump fake, as taking even a small hop without shooting constitutes an \"up-and-down\" penalty in basketball. Basketball players need to be in top physical condition to perform at their best on the court. Without proper training and conditioning, players may struggle to keep up with the demands of the game. To improve their physical fitness, basketball players should focus on exercises that target their cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility. This can include activities such as running, weightlifting, and stretching. By incorporating these exercises into their routine, basketball players can improve their overall physical fitness and perform better on the court. A key aspect of basketball is the fast break, which involves quickly transitioning from defense to offense after gaining possession of the ball. This requires players to have excellent speed, agility, and endurance. To execute a successful fast break, players must be able to quickly move the ball up the court and create scoring opportunities. This can involve passing the ball to teammates, driving to the hoop, or shooting from outside. By practicing their fast break skills, basketball players can improve their team's chances of scoring and winning games. One popular shooting technique in basketball is the pull-up jumper, which involves quickly pulling up for a shot while in motion.

Among these thrilling moments, the fast break stands out as a testament to the game's quicksilver nature. During a fast break, offensive players rarely have the luxury of time. They can't afford to halt their momentum, carefully align their shot, and execute it at their leisure. Instead, they must make split-second decisions, either driving straight to the hoop for a lay-up or executing a jump shot on the fly. This dynamic scenario gives rise to a skill known as the \"pull-up jumper,\" a technique that, once mastered, becomes a formidable weapon in a player's arsenal.\n\nA pull-up jumper is executed when a player transitions seamlessly from running to shooting in one fluid motion, without any hesitation or pause. This skill is invaluable as it empowers the player to take shots from virtually any spot around the basket, leaving the defense with little time to react. To execute a pull-up jumper, one must begin by dribbling briskly, either at a fast jog or a full run, down the center of the court. As the player approaches the free throw line, a slight flare to the side is necessary. Coming to a balanced stop in rhythm with one's steps, the ball is brought up into both hands. Without hesitation, the player must immediately get low, leap, and release the shot. Mastery of this move requires relentless practice until the player can execute it swiftly, without faltering or stopping at any point.\n\nBasketball is not only about offense but also about overcoming defensive challenges. What do you do when you get the ball off of a pass and a defender is immediately right behind you, blocking your path to the hoop? One effective strategy to navigate such situations is the turnaround shot. This technique involves deceiving the defender by feigning movement in one direction, only to spin swiftly in the opposite direction and shoot as soon as the player faces the hoop. This maneuver often creates a brief window of opportunity during which the player can shoot without the defender obstructing them. \n\nTo execute a turnaround shot, the player begins with their back to the hoop, closely guarded by a defender. They must back towards the hoop while dribbling, maintaining a low stance until they are at a comfortable shooting distance. The player takes a step in the direction of their shooting hand while simultaneously dropping their non-shooting foot back slightly. A swift pivot on the non-shooting foot follows, culminating in an immediate jump shot. The turnaround shot is a testament to the player's agility, balance, and precision.\n\nIn the pantheon of basketball's most iconic plays, the fadeaway jump shot holds a special place. Many of the NBA's all-time greatest players had masterful fadeaway jump shots. As their name hints at, fadeaway shots are jump shots made when a player jumps and leans backward. This technique effectively distances the ball from the defender, affording the shooter the extra room needed to release the shot, thereby making it a formidable challenge for defenders to contest. However, executing fadeaway shots is no easy feat, requiring exceptional skill and precision. Consequently, they are often regarded as the hallmark of an excellent (or, debatably, selfish) player.\n\nTo execute a fadeaway, the player initiates the maneuver with an ordinary jump shot or a turnaround shot, as they typically would. As the player propels themselves into the air, they simultaneously push upward and backward, creating space between themselves and the defender. The backward lean of the spine contributes to this space, allowing the player to square up with the hoop while airborne. The ball is held just above the head, and at the zenith of the jump, the player releases the shot with a snapping motion of the wrist. It's worth noting that fadeaways demand significantly more wrist strength than standard shots, as much of the leg-generated power is expended on propelling the shooter backward rather than upward.\n\nAn often-overlooked aspect of a great jump shot is the discernment of knowing when not to shoot. By judiciously mixing shots with well-timed fakeouts, players can keep defenders guessing, adding an element of unpredictability to their game. More importantly, a convincing fake can create shooting opportunities even when a tenacious defender refuses to give an inch. To execute an effective pump fake, the player adopts a low stance, mimicking the position just before taking a shot. The ball is brought up in front, and the player prepares to jump. However, just as the ascent begins, the player halts abruptly, stopping short of leaving the ground.\n\nIf the defender takes the bait and jumps in response to the fake, the player can either swiftly dart around them or time their own jump to shoot as the defender descends, thereby securing a clear shot. It's imperative to maintain contact with the floor during the pump fake, as even the slightest hop without shooting results in an \"up-and-down\" penalty in basketball. Mastering these techniques and understanding the nuances of when to employ them can elevate a player's game, transforming them from a mere participant to a formidable force on the court.", "scores": {"ppl": 31.594457626342773, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.620925188064575, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Recently, multilingual pre-trained language models like mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), and several others (Chi et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2022) have greatly advanced multilingual language comprehension by pretraining large Transformer models on extensive web-scale corpora, including Wikipedia and CommonCrawl. These models achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual transfer and excel in numerous multilingual NLP tasks, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering, as a result of contributions from researchers at Amazon (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Pires et al., 2019). However, real-world systems often face various types of noise, including linguistic variations, typographical errors, and grammatical inconsistencies, which are commonly present in textual data but typically absent from benchmark datasets. Although prior research has extensively explored robustness in monolingual settings, primarily focusing on English (Peng et al., 2021; Sengupta et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020), there is a lack of studies addressing this issue in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we explore the impact of realistic noise in multilingual settings and propose methods to improve the robustness of multilingual language models across four key NLP tasks: Intent Classification (IC), Slot Labeling (SL), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Given the absence of multilingual noisy evaluation data, we create benchmarks by extracting noise from publicly available corpora, such as social media datasets and Wikipedia edits, and embedding this noise into the test sets for each of the four tasks. We perform rigorous human validation to ensure the realism of this noised data, as illustrated with examples from MultiATIS++ in Figure 1, and identify a wide range of noise types across different languages (detailed in \u00a73). These analyses highlight the potential of our test set to effectively evaluate and stimulate future research on multilingual robustness. To assess the performance of multilingual systems, we employ accuracy metrics for two utterance-level tasks: Intent Classification (IC%) and Natural Language Inference (NLI%), alongside F1 scores for two token-level classification tasks: Slot Labeling (SL-F1) and Named Entity Recognition (NER-F1). Specifically, we aim to evaluate the model's performance on the noised version of the test datasets in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting. In this scenario, training data for a task is available only in one language, English, while test data is provided in various languages (Liu et al., 2019, 2020). While augmenting training data enhances model robustness in monolingual (i.e., English) settings, it is not immediately clear if these robustness gains can transfer across languages, as highlighted by L C and confirmed through human expert evaluation. Error types can vary significantly by language; for example, typos in the Devanagari script can differ from those in Latin scripts, such as when a joined character in Devanagari is incorrectly split into two, altering the word 'school'. To enhance the robustness of pretrained multilingual models against noise across all languages, we propose Robust Contrastive Pretraining (RCP), which integrates multilingual noisy data augmentation with a contrastive learning loss term during pretraining. On the noisy test sets, our method improves multilingual model performance across all metrics and tasks: IC% increases by 4.9% on MultiATIS++ and 4.1% on MultiSNIPS; SL-F1 rises by 18.4 on MultiATIS++ and 8.6 on MultiSNIPS; NER-F1 grows by 2.9 on WikiANN; and NLI% gains 0.7% on XNLI.

Despite these successes, real-world applications of these models encounter challenges not typically present in standard benchmark datasets. Specifically, these systems must deal with the noise inherent in real-world textual data, which includes linguistic variations and common errors.\n\nWhile considerable research has addressed robustness issues in monolingual contexts, as shown in the works of Peng et al., Sengupta et al., and Tan et al., there has been limited exploration of this challenge in multilingual settings. Our study aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of realistic noise on multilingual language models. We introduce methods designed to enhance the robustness of these models across four key NLP tasks: Intent Classification (IC), Slot Labeling (SL), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Natural Language Inference (NLI).\n\nOne significant hurdle in this research is the absence of multilingual noisy evaluation data. To address this, we have created synthetic benchmarks by mining noise from publicly available corpora and integrating it into the test sets corresponding to each of the four tasks. We then conduct human validation to confirm the realism of this synthesized noise, using examples from datasets like MultiATIS++.

This method combines multilingual noisy data augmentation with a contrastive learning loss term during the pretraining phase. The goal is to encourage the model to develop similar representations for both the original and the noise-infused versions of a sentence. Our experiments demonstrate that this method leads to improved performance of multilingual models on noisy test sets across all metrics and tasks. Specifically, our approach enhances IC% by 4.9% on the MultiATIS++ dataset and by 4.1% on the MultiSNIPS dataset. Similarly, SL-F1 scores increase by 18.4 on MultiATIS++ and by 8.6 on MultiSNIPS, while NER-F1 scores improve by 2.9 on WikiANN.

Try to hone in on what you\u2019re really worried about by identifying specific thoughts and feelings that cause the most distress, such as the fear of being judged harshly by others or the worry of facing rejection in social situations. Consider specific scenarios or interactions that trigger your anxiety. Think about how you can address them more effectively by preparing strategies in advance. Ask yourself if your anxiety comes from past experiences, current situations, or feedback from others, and take the time to analyze how each source impacts your feelings by reflecting on their significance and relevance to your life today. In some cases, you may find that your concerns are rational, such as when they are based on feedback from colleagues or supervisors, which can provide constructive insights for improvement, helping you grow professionally and build stronger working relationships. It's also possible that you're hung up on anxieties you learned at some earlier point in your life, such as fears of rejection or failure instilled by significant past events or relationships, and these continue to affect your confidence and decision-making, potentially hindering your personal and professional growth. With some reflection, you may decide those fears are unfounded and not based on your current reality, allowing you to let go of them and move forward with greater confidence and a clearer perspective, opening yourself up to new opportunities and experiences.

If you\u2019re in a workplace where tattoos are considered inappropriate, such as a conservative law office, that might be a legitimate concern that you need to address by finding ways to balance personal expression with professional expectations, possibly by discussing dress code policies with your employer to ensure mutual understanding and respect. Additionally, consider whether your anxiety comes from other sources, such as messages you received from your parents growing up, which can influence how you perceive yourself today and shape your self-esteem, potentially leading to internalized doubts or fears that affect your confidence and relationships. For example, they might have told you, \u201cIf you get a tattoo, nobody will trust you,\u201d which could have a lasting impact on your self-image and contribute to ongoing self-doubt, affecting your confidence in social and professional settings and making it challenging to assert your true self. Being mindful means becoming more aware of your surroundings, thoughts, and feelings at any given moment, which can help you manage anxiety by keeping you grounded in the present and reducing the influence of negative thoughts, allowing you to respond more calmly to stressors and enhance your emotional resilience. Practice mindful meditation regularly to help you get used to being consistently mindful, which can improve your ability to stay calm and focused, even in stressful situations, enhancing your resilience and mental clarity, and enabling you to handle challenges more effectively. One effective way to take your mind off what other people are thinking is to do something productive, which can redirect your focus and boost your confidence by providing a sense of accomplishment and demonstrating your capabilities, ultimately reinforcing your self-worth and potential. Engage in activities that are meaningful or fulfilling to you, such as working on a hobby or creative project you enjoy, which can bring satisfaction and joy, enhancing your overall well-being and giving you a sense of purpose, contributing positively to your mental health and life satisfaction. Volunteer for a cause you support, which can provide a sense of purpose and help you stay focused on positive outcomes, contributing to both your personal growth and the community, while building connections with like-minded individuals who share your values and passions. Go out of your way to do something kind for someone, such as helping a neighbor mow their lawn, as it can improve your mood and shift your focus to the positive impact you're making, fostering a sense of connection and goodwill, and enhancing your sense of community and belonging.", "scores": {"ppl": 19.983341217041016, "some": 0.8911341826121012, "bart": -2.5309064388275146, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Fears about others' opinions can feel overwhelming, especially when they are broad and undefined. To manage these fears, try to identify the specific worries you have. This approach not only makes your anxieties feel more manageable but also helps you develop a strategy to address them. For instance, you might generally fear being judged at work. Narrow down your concerns: Are you worried your boss thinks you lack productivity? Do you suspect a coworker is gossiping about you? Or perhaps you feel you need more training or support in your role?\n\nOnce you identify what's troubling you, consider the origin of these fears. Sometimes, your concerns may be rational and based on real situations. However, it's also possible that these anxieties stem from past experiences or learned behaviors. Reflect on whether these fears are justified. For example, you might worry about being judged for having tattoos. In a conservative workplace, this concern might be valid. However, in a relaxed environment like a coffee shop, tattoos may be more accepted. Consider if your anxiety is influenced by past messages, such as parental warnings about tattoos affecting trustworthiness.\n\nPracticing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. By focusing on the present moment, you can reduce worries about others' perceptions. If you catch yourself worrying about others' thoughts, gently redirect your focus to the present. Pay attention to your current actions, feelings, and goals. Acknowledge your thoughts and emotions without judgment. This awareness can make it easier to manage anxiety. Mindful meditation can be a useful tool to cultivate this awareness. Explore meditation apps or online guided exercises to help you practice mindfulness regularly.\n\nAnxiety about others' opinions often arises from fears of potential outcomes. You can alleviate these fears by devising a plan for worst-case scenarios. For example, if you worry about failing a group project and facing your peers' disapproval, ask yourself how you would handle such a situation. Consider what actions would help you feel better and prevent future mistakes. Even a simple plan, like apologizing for an error, can reduce feelings of helplessness and anxiety.\n\nEngaging in productive activities can also distract you from concerns about others' judgments. Focusing on meaningful tasks shifts your attention from potential criticism to your accomplishments. Consider completing a postponed chore or project, volunteering for a cause you support, or doing something kind for someone else. You might also work on a hobby or spend quality time with loved ones.

Researchers have found that increasing the parameter scale can enhance model capacity, leading them to further explore this scaling effect by significantly enlarging the models; this increase in capacity allows models to better capture complex patterns in data, resulting in improved language understanding and generation. Interestingly, when the parameter scale surpasses a certain threshold, these expanded language models not only achieve notable performance improvements, but they also exhibit unique abilities, such as in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning skills that smaller models like BERT do not possess.

Remarkably, when these models reach a certain parameter threshold, they not only perform better but also acquire unique abilities, such as in-context learning, absent in smaller models like BERT.\n\nIn response to these advancements, the term Large Language Models (LLMs) has been coined to describe PLMs with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. These LLMs have revolutionized computer language processing by understanding complex linguistic patterns and generating coherent responses. They are a formidable type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) used for tasks like machine translation and question answering. A prominent example of an LLM is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, which is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. Trained on a vast array of internet-sourced text data, ChatGPT excels in generating human-like responses and engaging users in meaningful conversations.\n\nIn recent years, both research institutions and technology companies have significantly increased their investment in developing LLMs, leading to groundbreaking models with diverse applications. OpenAI, a leader in this field, has advanced the GPT series, including GPT-3 and GPT-4, which have made significant strides in natural language generation, dialogue systems, and text comprehension.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been the subject of numerous studies, which have thoroughly examined their strengths and weaknesses. Recent research often follows a typical workflow: selecting models for testing, creating specialized benchmarks to address specific research questions, and then evaluating the models against these benchmarks. For instance, to determine whether LMMs understand colors, one must test the models on tasks related to color recognition. This requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, such as the number of colors to include and the complexity of the color palette. If a model performs well with a certain set of colors, researchers must decide whether to conclude the test or continue further analysis. \n\nConducting such experimental evaluations involves significant manual effort, including designing benchmarks, testing models, analyzing results, and determining whether the depth of analysis is adequate to draw meaningful conclusions. This process is not only labor-intensive but also complex, particularly in the design of benchmarks, which demands considerable domain expertise. Moreover, data collection and curation can be expensive, and the analysis of results is often subjective. These challenges have prompted the exploration of frameworks that can autonomously design and execute a wide range of experiments to evaluate existing LMMs.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the principles of programming visual tools via Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges. Our framework, named AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING OF EXPERIMENTS (APEX), is designed to autonomously redact a scientific report addressing any user-specified inquiry. It begins by creating a structured empty report and then iteratively improves it through a series of experiments. An LLM processes the user request by generating a suitable benchmark using image retrieval, generation, or augmentation, deploying models for testing, conducting experiments, and collecting and analyzing results. The findings are incorporated into the report, which is then reviewed by the LLM to determine if the information sufficiently addresses the initial inquiry. If not, APEX generates a new benchmark and conducts additional experiments, continuing this iterative process until the report is comprehensive enough to answer the user's question.\n\nWe evaluate APEX by applying it to a broad range of queries to demonstrate its flexibility in designing benchmarks and conducting experiments automatically. APEX successfully reaches valid and insightful conclusions, proving its capability to produce reliable reports. We show that APEX can replicate the core findings of existing manually engineered benchmark studies, thereby confirming its reliability. Additionally, APEX can manage queries of varying granularity, allowing users to thoroughly explore the strengths and weaknesses of existing LMMs. The modularity of APEX further enables the easy inclusion of new tools and capabilities, thereby widening the scope of its applications.\n\nTo summarize, this work introduces APEX, the first automated benchmark framework that tests various capabilities of LMMs based on user requests. APEX automates the design of benchmarks, execution of experiments, and analysis of results, with a modular design that allows for the integration of additional tools and functionalities. We demonstrate that APEX produces valid and comprehensive reports, capable of reproducing findings from previous studies. Furthermore, APEX facilitates the discovery of new strengths and weaknesses in existing LMMs by addressing arbitrary queries at different levels of granularity.

Family and close friends often show their support through acts of care and kindness, like providing comfort during difficult times, such as offering a listening ear, helping with daily tasks, or simply being present. Recently, my grandfather suffered a stroke, facing significant challenges like mobility issues and memory loss, which affected his ability to perform daily activities and remember important details. He struggled to recall familiar faces and past events, which was a poignant reminder of the extent of his memory loss. The stroke may have changed him, but his gentle and kind nature remained steadfast, shining through despite his hardships. My grandmother, however, showed a lack of love and empathy, harboring resentment and often expressing hatred for my grandfather, citing incidents like him urinating in the closet, which strained family relations. Despite these accusations, my grandfather's generosity was undeniable, as he gave everything he could, both financially and emotionally, to support his family. Unfortunately, my grandmother's lies led to him being committed to a psychiatric ward, where her falsehoods painted a distorted picture of his mental state. My grandfather, a veteran who served with honor, now finds himself in a mental institution for the criminally insane, a place far removed from the respect he once commanded. Unable to defend himself, he has become a ward of the state, with my family feeling powerless to change his situation due to legal constraints. My grandmother's decision to donate his body to a local university for science upon his death further illustrates her controlling nature, as she has even challenged the family to defy her by holding a funeral or a memorial service, leaving them without closure. A week ago, my mother informed me that my grandmother claimed my grandfather had clinically died, which raised concerns about his health and prompted us to question the accuracy of her statements. He remains isolated and very ill, suffering without the familiar comfort of his loved ones, which exacerbates his sense of loneliness. I am devastated by the loss of the grandfather I once knew and the fractured family relationships that have emerged, leaving me mourning both his decline and the rift within our family. This situation highlights the consequences of lies and the importance of truth in relationships, as dishonesty can lead to devastating outcomes.

My grandparents have been married for over fifty years, a duration that would typically suggest love and empathy, yet none were present from my grandmother. She harbored no admiration for him; instead, she held only disdain. She alleged that significant incidents occurred with my grandfather, such as him urinating in the closet, running away, and chasing her through the house to beat her. My grandmother openly expressed her resentment, citing an incident from the 1980s when my grandfather cashed out a life insurance policy for $5,000, a transgression she vowed never to forgive. Her inability to forgive influenced her two daughters, who mirrored this animosity towards my grandfather. Despite his efforts to provide financially and emotionally for them, his attempts were futile due to the lies my grandmother spread. Consequently, she managed to have him committed to a psychiatric ward, a facility for the criminally insane, even though he is a veteran. Unable to defend himself, my family rendered him a ward of the state. My grandmother even arranged for his body to be donated to a local university for scientific study upon his death, forbidding any funeral or memorial service. Just a week ago, my mother called to inform me that, according to my grandmother, my grandfather had clinically died but was revived.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Large-scale pre-trained models have become standard for various natural language processing tasks, highlighted by Devlin et al. in 2019a, with several NLP tasks achieving significant progress using these models, reaching previously unattainable performance (Clark et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019b). The size of these models has been steadily growing to hundreds of millions (Devlin et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019) to billions of parameters (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Code and task-agnostic checkpoints are available, but the huge size poses significant challenges for downstream applications in terms of energy consumption and increases the cost of inference (Strubell et al., 2019). As such, it could deter their use in practice, limiting their usage in edge scenarios and under constrained computational training or inference budgets. Several research directions have focused on compressing large-scale models, including work on pruning (Gordon et al., 2020), quantization (Han et al., 2016), and distillation (Sanh, 2019). Knowledge distillation, in particular, has shown strong results in compressing pre-trained transformer-based language models. With knowledge distillation, we train a student network with smaller capacity to mimic the full output distribution of the teacher network (Hinton et al., 2015). Knowledge distillation has been applied to pre-trained language model compression in two different settings: (1) before task-specific fine-tuning (i.e., task-agnostic distillation) or (2) after task-specific fine-tuning (i.e., task-specific distillation). Task-agnostic distillation (Sanh, 2019; Sun et al., 2019, 2020) has the advantage that the model needs to be distilled only once, allowing it to be reused for fine-tuning on multiple downstream tasks and achieving speedup in both fine-tuning and inference. On the other hand, task-specific distillation (Tang et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2019; Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020) has been shown to achieve significantly higher compression rates and provides inference speedup (Fu et al., 2020; Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020). In this work, we first study the transferability of pre-trained models across several source tasks to select the optimal task for transfer. We then aim to create universally distilled models for any downstream task. These models leverage the benefits of the techniques and use augmented resources developed for the source transfer task. We show that distilled models use task-specific data transfer to varying degrees, and their transferability depends on choices of the source task, data augmentation strategy, and distillation techniques. Contributions: More specifically, this work makes the following contributions. It studies the transferability of several source tasks in task-agnostic knowledge distillation and develops a distillation framework to learn a massively compressed student model, leveraging deep hidden representations and attention states from multiple layers of the teacher model with progressive knowledge transfer.

Despite their success, these models face challenges when applied to domain-specific texts. Such texts often differ in word usage, syntax, and writing style compared to general texts. Gururangan et al. (2020) suggested that continual pre-training of PLMs on domain-specific corpora can enhance their performance in specialized tasks. Gu et al. (2021) further argued that training domain-specific PLMs from scratch on a large corpus could yield even better results. Inspired by these findings, domain-specific PLMs have emerged in fields like biomedicine, with models such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. These models are used for tasks like entity and relation extraction.\n\nIn the financial domain, there is a growing need for NLP capabilities, particularly in information extraction and sentiment analysis. This demand is evident from various NLP competition tasks and datasets related to finance, summarized in Table 2. To address these needs, companies have developed Chinese financial PLMs, such as FinBERT and Mengzi-BERT-base-fin. However, these models are based on the outdated BERT-base architecture with around 110 million parameters. Consequently, they struggle to meet the increasing NLP demands in finance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce FinT5, the largest Chinese financial PLM to date, built on the T5 architecture. The base version of FinT5 comprises 220 million parameters, while the large version has 1 billion.\n\nFinancial NLP tasks often require models with robust entity knowledge understanding and memorization. Although PLMs trained on large-scale corpora possess some of these capabilities, they still have limitations. To improve this, various studies have employed knowledge-enhanced pretraining methods. However, these methods mainly target BERT-like models and lack strategies tailored for T5. To enhance T5's performance on financial tasks, we propose a concise knowledge-enhanced pretraining method based on T5's text-to-text paradigm.\n\nAnother challenge in Chinese financial NLP is the scarcity of corpus data. The scale and diversity of corpora are crucial for effective language model pre-training. Existing Chinese financial corpora are limited in size, diversity, and accessibility, as shown in Table 1. To address this, we first identified the text types needed for a comprehensive Chinese financial corpus. We collected almost all existing Chinese financial NLP tasks and summarized their text sources in Table 2. Based on this, we determined the range of text types to gather. Consequently, we developed BBT-FinCorpus, a large-scale Chinese financial corpus with around 300 GB of raw text from five diverse sources.\n\nBenchmark evaluations are pivotal in advancing PLMs, enabling direct comparisons between models. English PLMs use benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE, while Chinese PLMs use CLUE. However, there is no public benchmark for Chinese financial NLP, hindering the comparison of models and their improvement in this domain. To fill this gap, we introduce CFLEB, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding and Generation Evaluation Benchmark.

Many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are documented on support sites with detailed, step-by-step instructions to guide users through the user interface (UI). Our research addresses the challenge of utilizing these help documents to create interactive tutorials directly overlaid on the phone\u2019s UI. This process requires several natural language processing (NLP) components, such as retrieval, parsing, and grounding. Unfortunately, there is no existing dataset for this task in a multilingual context. Building on previous work in the NLP community (Li et al., 2020a), we aim to extend this research in multilingual and multimodal dimensions.\n\nTo facilitate this, we have developed a new multilingual, multimodal UI-grounded dataset named UGIF-DataSet. This dataset allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of generating step-by-step tutorials on the Android UI. It comprises 523 how-to queries per language, each accompanied by step-by-step instructions in English, along with a sequence of UI screenshots and actions demonstrating how to complete each task. These instructions and UI sequences are available in eight different languages, providing a comprehensive multilingual dataset. Figure 2 outlines the structure of this dataset. The dataset is particularly focused on retrieval, parsing, and instruction following in Android, making it highly relevant to the NLP community.\n\nThe main challenge in this endeavor stems from the linguistic diversity of smartphone users. Many users are bilingual or multilingual, frequently interacting with their devices in languages other than English. They often pose queries in their native languages, yet the help documents are typically available only in English. This situation necessitates cross-modal, cross-lingual retrieval processes. Additionally, users may select a different UI or system language, and application developers do not always offer translations for every UI element. Consequently, some UI elements appear in English while others are in the chosen system language, highlighting the need for cross-lingual UI grounding to map English instruction steps to UI screens in various languages.\n\nWe propose an initial approach to tackle this task by dividing it into retrieval, parsing, and grounding phases. When a user voices a query, we retrieve the corresponding FAQ page from the support site using an off-the-shelf speech recognizer combined with a multilingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) to locate the most relevant how-to question within the help document corpus. The help document\u2019s step-by-step instructions are parsed using a large language model (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to generate macros like tap(), toggle(), and home(). This macro sequence is then used to create an on-device tutorial by grounding each macro within the UI. A multilingual sentence embedding model (Feng et al., 2020) identifies the closest matching UI element, facilitating an interactive tutorial experience.\n\nThe contributions of this work are significant: \n1. We introduce UGIF-DataSet, a novel multilingual, multimodal dataset of how-to queries and sequences of UI screens and actions curated by human annotators. This represents the first dataset of its kind.\n2. We evaluate the parsing of step-by-step how-to instructions using large language models and assess UI grounding with the multilingual BERT sentence embedding model (LaBSE).\n3. Our findings reveal considerable scope for enhancing performance, particularly in non-English languages. Furthermore, we discover that UI mismatches, arising from version updates and evolving app designs, are a major source of errors, offering both research and engineering challenges.\n\nThrough our work, we aim to improve the accessibility and usability of smartphone interfaces, particularly for users in multilingual settings, by leveraging advanced NLP techniques to create seamless, language-inclusive tutorial experiences.", "scores": {"ppl": 55.28521728515625, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -1.6466840505599976, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

MMT incorporates multiple data types: textual descriptions, visual content, and contextual cues to enhance translation quality. Figure 1 compares MMT and Multilingual MMT, highlighting their differences in model architecture and efficiency, and showing the benefits of using one model for multiple languages, such as reduced resource usage and increased consistency. MMT requires training separate models. Multilingual MMT uses one model to translate between multiple languages, reducing computational costs and simplifying the translation process. Previous MMT models handle single language pairs well but become impractical when dealing with a large number of languages. One solution is to use a single model for multiple languages, reducing costs and simplifying maintenance, thereby increasing operational efficiency. Multilingual machine translation has been studied for years, but existing methods often ignore the visual context, leading to potential translation inaccuracies and a lack of semantic depth. We propose integrating vision context to enhance translation quality. We propose the Multilingual Multimodal MMT model to translate multiple languages with a single model. Our LVP-M3 method, including Token Encoding, LVPG, and Language Translation, addresses. In Token Encoding, a pre-trained vision encoder extracts visual tokens to improve translation by converting visual features into a format compatible with the language model, enhancing the semantic depth. During language translation, coTransformer generates vision-guided language tokens by integrating visual and textual data, creating a more robust translation output. The Transformer decoder predicts the translation results efficiently by leveraging an optimized architecture, which reduces processing time while maintaining high accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark datasets for LVP-M3 to demonstrate its effectiveness, showing significant improvements in translation quality and accuracy.

This approach reduces computational costs significantly.\n\nMultilingual machine translation has been explored for years. However, existing methods typically focus only on linguistic inputs, ignoring visual contexts. Our work introduces the Multilingual Multimodal Machine Translation (Multilingual MMT) task. This task aims to translate multiple languages using a single model, incorporating visual information effectively.\n\nTo address existing limitations, we propose the LVP-M3 method. This method includes three main components: Token Encoding, Language-aware Visual Prompt Generation (LVPG), and Language Translation. During the token encoding stage, we use a pre-trained vision encoder to extract visual tokens. We then employ the Transformer to encode textual tokens.\n\nIn the LVPG stage, inspired by previous research, we use a controller network to dynamically generate mapping network parameters based on the target language. This network outputs language-aware visual prompts tailored to each target language. During language translation, we utilize the coTransformer to produce vision-guided language tokens. The Transformer decoder then predicts translation results.\n\nExtensive experiments on our benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our LVP-M3 method. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all translation directions. Notably, it outperforms text-only multilingual models by an average of 4.3 BLEU scores. Our contributions are summarized as follows.\n\nFirstly, we introduce Multilingual MMT to handle translations for multiple language pairs. This approach investigates the impact of visual modality in multilingual translation and reduces computational costs. Secondly, we propose an effective strategy for language-aware visual prompt generation. This strategy produces visual prompts tailored to different target languages, utilizing both visual modality and target language type.\n\nLastly, we establish two Multilingual MMT benchmark datasets to foster further research in this area. Extensive experiments on these datasets highlight the effectiveness of our LVP-M3 method. These contributions pave the way for more efficient and accurate multilingual translations in a multimodal context.\n\nIn summary, our work advances the field of machine translation by integrating visual information into multilingual models. This integration not only enhances translation accuracy but also reduces computational overhead. The LVP-M3 method represents a significant step forward, offering a robust framework for future research and applications in multilingual multimodal translation.", "scores": {"ppl": 77.45813751220703, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -1.7021610736846924, "acc": 1.0}}}

These models are trained on extensive amounts of data and exhibit increased accuracy and emergent abilities as their parameter count grows from millions to billions [52]. LLMs designed for coding are also trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to effectively learn the structure and syntax of programming languages and apply this knowledge to various coding tasks. As a result, they are highly adept at tasks like generating code [21] and summarizing. They are also proficient in completing complex code tasks that require an understanding of intricate programming concepts [30]. Large language models also exhibit emergent capabilities, which cannot be predicted by extrapolating scaling laws and only emerge at a certain critical model size threshold [50]. This makes it appealing to train ever-larger models, as capabilities such as chain-of-thought prompting [51] and instruction tuning [42] only become feasible in models with more than 100B parameters [50]. Many have noted that large language models trained on natural language are capable of memorising extensive amounts of training data, which can lead to potential issues [2, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 23, 29, 32, 37, 46, 48]. The issue of memorisation in source code is distinct from that of natural language because source code is governed by different licences that reflect different values than natural language [16, 23]. Hence, in addition to privacy considerations, the memorisation of source code can have legal ramifications, as the open-source code used in LLM training for code is frequently licenced under nonpermissive copy-left licences, such as GPL or the CC-BY-SA licence employed by StackOverflow [2]. Reusing code covered by these licences without making the source code available under the same licence is considered a violation of copyright law, and in some jurisdictions, this leaves users of tools such as CoPilot at legal risk [2, 16, 23]. Licences are unavoidably linked to the source code, as they enforce the developers\u2019 commitment to sharing, transparency, and openness [2, 16], and sharing code without proper licences is also ethically questionable, raising concerns among developers [2, 23, 46]. Memorised data can also include sensitive private information, extending privacy concerns to code, which can contain credentials, API keys, emails, and other sensitive information as well [2, 4, 10, 13, 28]. Memorisation could therefore put the private information contained in the training data at risk, and recently, attacks leveraging memorisation have successfully extracted (or reconstructed) training data from LLMs [3, 5, 13, 29]. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) considers data reconstruction attacks to be the most concerning type of privacy attack against machine learning models, and OWASP classifies Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06) as the sixth most critical vulnerability in LLM applications [41].

These models are pre-trained on tasks like masked language modeling (MLM) and next-sentence prediction (NSP), offering task-agnostic capabilities that facilitate transfer to new tasks with minimal data through fine-tuning. Expanding these models to multiple languages is the logical progression, demonstrated by the emergence of multilingual transformers like multilingual BERT (mBERT), XLM (Conneau and Lample, 2019), and XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020a). This builds on earlier efforts to achieve transferable multilingual representations using recurrent network-based methods (e.g., Artetxe et al., 2019) and multilingual embedding representations (Ruder et al., 2017).\n\nThe substantial capacity of these multilingual models and their cross-lingual task success have spurred research into the nature of the representations learned during pre-training. Some research indicates that models like mBERT develop robust language-specific representations (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Libovick\u00fd et al., 2020; Choenni and Shutova, 2020). Conversely, these models also acquire language-neutral representations that transcend linguistic distinctions, enabling them to handle meaning aspects independently of language. This capacity allows models to be fine-tuned on monolingual datasets and still perform well in other languages, a technique known as cross-lingual zero-shot learning (Pires et al., 2019; Libovick\u00fd et al., 2020; Conneau et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020). These findings have inspired researchers to disentangle the language-specific and language-neutral components of mBERT (e.g., Libovick\u00fd et al., 2020; Gonen et al., 2020).\n\nThis background sets the stage for our research. We investigate the relationship between language-specific and language-neutral representations in mBERT, aiming to understand how fine-tuning affects the balance between these two types of representations. Specifically, we examine the impact of fine-tuning on mBERT\u2019s representations through two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging and natural language inference (NLI). These tasks impose different demands on the model's semantic and language-specific knowledge. While NLI involves reasoning about deep semantic relations, POS tagging requires knowledge of a language\u2019s morphosyntactic features. Although many languages share such features due to typological relations, which mBERT exploits (e.g., Pires et al., 2019; Choenni and Shutova, 2020; Rama et al., 2020), there are also language-specific features. We hypothesize that mBERT allocates more representational capacity to these features for the POS task compared to NLI.\n\nWe examine how mBERT accommodates language-specific and language-neutral representations, varying by the task it fine-tunes on. We support our findings with language identification (LID) experiments on task-specific data and a new dataset extracted from Wikipedia. Additionally, we explore two strategies to 'unlearn' language-specific representations: gradient reversal and iterative adversarial learning. These methods do not significantly enhance the language-independent component for cross-lingual transfer beyond the effects of fine-tuning. Therefore, we conclude that fine-tuning already reorganizes mBERT's representations effectively. Our objective is not to enhance mBERT\u2019s multilinguality but to gain a deeper understanding of its functioning, building on previous work.\n\nOur contributions are: (a) further support for the distinction between language-specific and language-neutral representations in mBERT; (b) evidence that fine-tuning reorganizes mBERT\u2019s representations, disrupting existing language clusters; (c) analysis of two methods for enhancing language-neutrality, which do not improve task performance; (d) introduction of a new Wikipedia-based language identification dataset.", "scores": {"ppl": 47.90909194946289, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.2635685205459595, "acc": 0.3333333333333333}}}

Jang et al. 2019, Kim and Jeong 2019, Risch and Krestel 2019, Li et al. 2020, Heo et al. 2021. Since the advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Transformer-based deep learning models can cause underfitting. This occurs because the size of the model can be too extensive compared to the size of the training data (Liu et al., 2019). In this regard, some studies have shown that performance can be improved in various tasks by artificially increasing the size of the data (Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In data-driven machine learning, collecting a sufficient amount of high-quality data is crucial. This ensures an adequate level of model learning. Since such collection processes are not always viable, many studies tackle this issue from the perspective of augmentation using pre-existing data. Yu et al. 2018, Wei and Zou 2019, Feng et al., Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, Xie et al. 2020. The first involves collecting data using human resources. The other involves creating and modifying data mechanically or semi-automatically. However, collecting and pre-processing large-scale data manually is extremely time-consuming. Additionally, it is costly. Therefore, various automation strategies have proposed to overcome such limitations. In representative approaches, data augmentation can be achieved by using a generation model. Alternatively, it can be modified by changing a part of the text. As one of the studies using generation models, Yu et al. (2018) proposed a method using a back-translation method with both directions of machine translation systems. Here, the data augmentation can be done by translating an English sentence into French. However, since semantic discrepancies can occur in the round-trip translation to other languages, the augmentation of natural sentences is often not guaranteed. Additionally, syntactically plausible sentences may not always be produced. In the approach using text modification, data similar to the original text can be generated using strategies such as replacing a specific word with a synonym. Other studies have investigated the effects of adding synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponyms and hypernyms, and using semantic text exchange (Feng et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, using a thesaurus such as WordNet or a part-of-speech tagger usually requires a significant amount of time. Additionally, it demands a substantial budget. To address the above limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation model and character order change (COC) strategy. Our methodology includes three steps (Figure 1). The first involves augmenting data using a generation model on raw text. We define this as data augmentation with generation (DAG). The second involves augmenting data using COC, a strategy that modifies some words appearing in raw text, which we define as data augmentation with modification (DAM). Finally, we combine the two methods and call this data augmentation with generation and modification (DAGAM). Our methodology includes a simple and easy strategy for automatically augmenting natural language data. We perform data augmentation on six benchmark datasets in the text classification task. To evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme, we use BERT, a representative Transformer-based pre-trained language model, for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our methodology improves performance across all benchmark datasets compared to cases with no augmentation.", "scores": {"ppl": 60.75924301147461, "some": 0.8672600587209066, "bart": -1.5037636756896973, "acc": 1.0}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Text classification is a key task in natural language processing (NLP), with active research across various domains.

Since the introduction of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT, Transformer-based models have shown exceptional performance in text classification tasks. \n\nNotable works include those by Vaswani et al. (2017), Yu et al. (2019), and Devlin et al. (2019). Despite their success, Transformer-based deep learning models can suffer from underfitting, especially when the model size is disproportionate to the training data size. Liu et al.

However, semantic discrepancies may arise in round-trip translations, hindering the creation of natural and syntactically plausible sentences.\n\nIn the text modification approach, data similar to the original is augmented using strategies like replacing specific words with synonyms or inserting random words. Techniques also include changing the position of two random words in a sentence or deleting a random word. Wei and Zou (2019) explored these methods. Other studies, such as those by Feng et al.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Dealers offer enticing financing deals throughout the year, making it easier to afford your dream vehicle. When you're flexible about the make or model, shopping around can help you find the best deal by comparing different offers and taking advantage of discounts. Understanding your credit score is crucial, as it determines your interest rates, loan terms, and overall financing options, affecting how much you pay for the car in the long run. Prime borrowers, those with credit scores in the 700s or higher, typically receive the most favorable offers, including lower interest rates and better loan terms. Trading in an old car can be advantageous, with many dealers offering promotions that increase your trade-in value, potentially lowering the cost of your new vehicle. If you've done your research, you have a few dealerships in mind. By evaluating their inventory online, you can save time and ensure the dealership has what you're looking for, making your visit more efficient and productive. To find the best car for you, consider factors beyond price, such as reliability, fuel efficiency, safety features, and long-term maintenance costs. Dealers may highlight monthly payments instead of the total price to make offers seem more affordable, but this can obscure the true cost of the loan. This strategy can result in you paying more over time due to increased interest costs on a longer-term loan, which can significantly add to the overall expense. Dealer financing offers flexibility with a wide range of vehicles available, though it may come with higher interest rates compared to other financing options. However, always inspect the car's history and condition before purchasing to ensure its quality and avoid future issues. Depreciation means that cars lose value over time, affecting resale value and equity in the vehicle, which can impact your financial situation when it comes time to sell or trade in the car. When financing a used car, it's wise to minimize the amount you borrow to avoid excessive interest costs and potential negative equity. A down payment of 10 to 20 percent can secure better interest rates and lower your loan balance, making your monthly payments more manageable. Making a substantial down payment helps maintain positive equity, ensuring you owe less than the car is worth. This is particularly important to avoid when you're financing a used car, which could develop mechanical problems relatively quickly. Providing accurate information at the dealership is essential to streamline the financing process and avoid delays or complications. While it may take a few minutes, the dealer can usually provide a financing offer the same day, giving you the opportunity to finalize your purchase quickly. Discussing the terms allows you to understand the financial commitment and make informed decisions, ensuring you choose the best option for your situation. The finance company may require additional documents, such as pay stubs, to verify your income, ensuring you can afford the loan. If the dealer requests these documents, submit them promptly to avoid jeopardizing your offer and ensure a smooth transaction. Being informed about your credit score can empower you to negotiate better terms with the dealer, potentially saving you money. Review each term carefully and look for opportunities to improve them, such as negotiating lower interest rates or better loan conditions. Opting for a shorter loan term usually results in lower interest rates and reduced time committed to the loan, saving you money in the long run. Dealers often emphasize monthly payments because they seem more manageable, but focusing on them can lead to overlooking the overall cost. Shorter-term financing means higher monthly payments but overall savings due to reduced interest charges, making it a cost-effective option. Dealers typically add extra fees, including sales tax and registration fees, which can significantly increase the total cost of the vehicle. Dealer warranties may offer peace of mind but come with additional costs, so weigh the benefits against the price. The dealer can incorporate these fees into your financing, but this will increase the total amount you pay over the life of the loan.

Generally, the most attractive deals are reserved for prime borrowers with credit scores in the 700s or higher. When trading in an old vehicle, search for dealer promotions that might double the trade-in value or guarantee a minimum amount regardless of the car's condition. If you've conducted thorough research, you likely have several dealerships in mind by now. Evaluating their inventory online is a smart move before visiting them in person. This will help you identify the most suitable car based on its overall price. Dealers often advertise monthly payment amounts rather than the total cost, which can be a strategy to charge a higher interest rate. Dealers typically will finance any car on their lot, so you may have more variety to choose from if you use dealer financing than you would if you used direct financing. However, this increased selection might not always be beneficial, as it's essential to verify the car's history and have it inspected before making a purchase. Keep in mind that cars depreciate in value over time. When purchasing a used car, it's advisable to finance as little of the total price as possible. A down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price generally secures the best interest rates available. Making a substantial down payment can help you avoid being underwater on your loan, meaning you owe more than the car's current market value. This situation is particularly important to avoid with used cars, which might develop mechanical issues relatively quickly. To complete the financing application at the dealership, you'll need basic identification information, income details, and employment data. It may take a few minutes, but in most cases the dealer will have a financing offer available for you that day. Afterward, they will invite you to an office to discuss the terms they have proposed. The finance company may require additional documents from you, such as pay stubs to verify income. If any such documents are requested, provide copies to the dealer promptly to avoid jeopardizing your financing offer. With thorough research and knowledge of your credit score, you might secure better terms than initially proposed. Scrutinize each term and see if there is room for improvement. For instance, you generally want the shortest loan term possible since it often comes with the lowest interest rates. However, dealers tend to emphasize the monthly payment amount. Opting for a shorter loan term results in higher monthly payments, but it saves money in the long run. Be aware that dealers may add extra charges, including sales tax, registration fees, and document or destination fees.

{"trips_4o": {"polished_text": "Researchers working on climate change-related topics increasingly use natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract relevant information from textual data. Examples include the sentiment or specificity of language used by companies when discussing climate risks. This helps measure corporate climate change exposure, increasing transparency to help the public understand where we stand on climate change (e.g., Callaghan et al. 2021; Bingler et al. 2022b). Many studies in this domain use traditional NLP methods, like dictionaries, bag-of-words approaches, or simple extensions of these methods (e.g., Gr\u00fcning 2011; Sautner et al. 2022). However, these analyses face considerable limitations due to variations in climate-related wording across different sources, as highlighted by Kim and Kang (2018). Deep learning techniques, which promise higher accuracy, are gradually replacing these approaches. For instance, K\u00f6lbel et al. (2020), Luccioni, Baylor, and Duchene (2020), Bingler et al. (2022a), Callaghan et al. (2021), Wang, Chillrud, and McKeown (2021), and Friederich et al. (2021) have all contributed to this transition. Indeed, it has been shown in related domains that deep learning in NLP achieves impressive results, often outperforming traditional methods by large margins (Varini et al. 2020). These deep learning-based approaches utilize language models (LMs), which are trained on large amounts of textual and unlabeled data. This training on unlabeled data, known as pretraining, enables the model to learn word representations and common language patterns. One of the most prominent language models is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) developed by Devlin et al. (2018). Its successors include ROBERTA (Liu et al. 2019), Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019), and ELECTRA (Clark et al. 2020). These models have been trained on vast amounts of text sourced from a wide range of online resources. After the pretraining phase, most LMs are further trained on additional tasks, known as downstream tasks. For these downstream tasks, the LM leverages the word representations and language patterns acquired during the pretraining phase. The benefit of pretraining is particularly significant in downstream tasks where collecting samples is challenging, resulting in small training datasets (hundreds or a few thousand samples). Furthermore, a model pretrained on text specific to the downstream task has been shown to perform better than one pretrained only on general text (Araci 2019; Lee et al. 2020). Consequently, an extension to the standard pretraining approach, known as domain-adaptive pretraining, has been proposed (Gururangan et al. 2020). This approach has been studied for various tasks and typically involves pretraining multiple times, particularly in the language domain of the downstream task. This process typically involves general domain pretraining, followed by domain-adaptive pretraining, and finally training on the specific downstream task. To date, despite the increased use of NLP in climate change-related research, a model with climate domain-adaptive pretraining has not yet been publicly available. Research has so far relied on models pretrained on general language and fine-tuned on the downstream task. To address this gap, we make three contributions. First, we introduce CLIMATEBERT, a state-of-the-art language model specifically pretrained on climate-related text corpora from various sources, such as news, corporate disclosures, and scientific articles. This language model is designed to assist researchers from various disciplines in developing better-performing NLP models for a wide range of downstream tasks related to climate change. Second, to demonstrate the strength of CLIMATEBERT, we highlight the performance improvements achieved using CLIMATEBERT on three standard climate-related NLP downstream tasks.", "scores": {"ppl": 50.29482650756836, "some": 0.8672600587209066, "bart": -1.220312476158142, "acc": 0.6666666666666666}}, "gpt_4o": {"polished_text": "Researchers focusing on climate change increasingly leverage natural language processing (NLP) to glean insights from textual data.

Many studies in this field employ traditional NLP techniques, such as dictionaries or bag-of-words approaches, though these have notable limitations. Climate-related language can vary significantly by source, complicating consistent analysis (Kim and Kang 2018). As a result, deep learning techniques that offer greater accuracy are gradually supplanting traditional methods (e.g., K\u00f6lbel et al. 2020; Luccioni, Baylor, and Duchene 2020; Bingler et al. 2022a; Callaghan et al. 2021; Wang, Chillrud, and McKeown 2021; Friederich et al. 2021).\n\nDeep learning in NLP has demonstrated impressive results, frequently outperforming older methods by substantial margins (Varini et al. 2020).

Pretraining is particularly advantageous for tasks with limited sample collections, as these result in smaller training datasets. Studies reveal that models pretrained on domain-specific text perform better than those pretrained solely on general text (Araci 2019; Lee et al. 2020). Consequently, domain-adaptive pretraining has emerged as a straightforward enhancement to standard pretraining methods (Gururangan et al. 2020). This involves multiple rounds of pretraining, including pretraining in the language domain of the downstream task. The process typically follows a sequence: general domain pretraining, domain-adaptive pretraining, and finally, downstream task training.\n\nDespite the growing use of NLP in climate change research, a model with climate domain-adaptive pretraining has not yet been publicly available.

Additionally, to encourage further research at the intersection of climate change and NLP, we have made the training code and model weights publicly available on platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face.

Consider purchasing a digital thermometer, either an 'oral' or 'rectal' model, at your local pharmacy for better accuracy. It is crucial to dedicate this thermometer to use with your horse; if you cannot get a digital thermometer, consider using a mercury thermometer instead. You also need a gentle lubricant, such as Vaseline or KY Jelly, to ease the insertion of the thermometer into the horse's rectum, along with a pair of latex or rubber gloves, cotton wool or tissues, and rubbing alcohol, all readily available at grocery stores and pharmacies. It is essential to time taking a horse\u2019s temperature just after it has passed stool to minimize the risk of inserting the thermometer into dung. Dung registers a higher temperature, leading to an inaccurate body temperature reading. Feeding the horse or giving it a treat can help build trust. However, if you are caring for a friend's horse or are new to equine first aid, it is essential to become familiar with the horse and let it get familiar with you. Talk soothingly to your horse, offering it a small treat such as a carrot or apple, and gently scratch your horse\u2019s nose or behind its ears. Ensure the horse remains still while you take its temperature by securing it to a wooden fence or post with a quick-release knot, so you can release it quickly if it gets spooked or agitated. A helper can hold the horse and talk soothingly to it as you take the temperature, significantly reducing the risk of getting kicked or trampled and allowing you to focus on the task while another person monitors the horse's reactions. If you are using a digital thermometer, switch it on and ensure the digital display appears in the window to confirm that the thermometer is functioning properly and the battery is not dead. Wait until the digital display flashes an 'L' to indicate a low-temperature reading. If you are using a traditional mercury thermometer, shake it vigorously two or three times to ensure the mercury has returned to the bulb before use, as failing to do so can result in a false high reading. Apply Vaseline or KY Jelly to the bulb end before insertion. Once this is done, you are ready to take the horse's temperature. Prevent your horse from getting spooked by standing on the near side, as most horses are trained to be handled on the near side, and approach the rear of the horse from the front at an angle. This allows the horse to see you, as horses have blind spots directly behind and in front of them, making it less likely for the horse to startle.

After that, we headed to a small jazz club where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing. It was a small cafe with a prominently displayed triptych of a chairman. There are very good painters in Bogota, and very elaborate murals to be seen everywhere, and even the graffiti approaches high art.
