If you are aware that others are experiencing similar issues with your boss, discreetly talk to them about the situation and see if you can gather more information. Approach them discreetly and ask if they've experienced similar issues with your boss. Ask if your boss has ever bullied them, providing specific examples of their behavior. If you trust this colleague, share your own experiences with your boss and ask for his or her support. Ensure your colleague understands the importance of confidentiality and agrees to keep the conversation private. Document each instance of bullying behavior and store the records securely, such as in a digital note-taking app or a locked folder. Keep a detailed log of bullying incidents, including the date, time, and specific behaviors exhibited by your boss. Additionally, document instances of bullying behavior directed towards other colleagues. Include the names of any witnesses who observed the bullying behavior. Collecting evidence of repeated bullying behavior can help build a case against your boss. Store relevant emails and memos that demonstrate your boss's unprofessional or unfair behavior, as these can serve as evidence. It's possible that your relationship with your boss started off on a bad note. Establishing clear boundaries early on can help improve your working relationship with your boss. Some managers believe they can speak to employees in any way they want, especially when mistakes are made, but this is not acceptable behavior. When this happens, calmly explain that you take responsibility for the mistake but expect to be treated with respect and prefer to discuss it in a private setting rather than being publicly reprimanded. You can express your disagreement and suggest a more constructive way to resolve the issue, such as by discussing it in a calm and respectful manner. Assertively expressing your boundaries may be enough to address the issue, but in more severe cases, further action may be necessary. High expectations and strict deadlines can be a sign of a demanding manager, but they do not necessarily indicate bullying behavior. Understanding the characteristics of a bullying boss will help you identify and address the issue more effectively. A perfectionistic boss may be challenging to work with, but his or her high standards are likely driven by a desire to achieve excellent results for the company. A demanding perfectionist boss may be more open to discussion and compromise, which sets them apart from a true bully. Bullying behavior often involves verbal aggression, such as yelling or using profanity, and can be intimidating and abusive. A bully may engage in gossip or spread false information about you. Other common signs of bullying behavior from a boss include invading your personal space, excessively controlling your work, harshly criticizing your work, and publicly doubting your abilities. A bully may attempt to undermine your authority by setting unrealistic deadlines or frequently changing project requirements. A bully may unfairly attribute blame to you for events outside your control or obstruct your career advancement opportunities."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 42.688316345214844, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.3820571899414062, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "When dealing with a bullying boss, it's advisable to confide in a friend outside your workplace.

You should highlight or underline important passages and write a brief note in the margin of the book or on a sticky note explaining their significance, such as 'symbolism,' 'character shift,' or 'repeated metaphor.' In your notes, record significant moments and shifts in the story. Take notes during class discussions, focusing on marking pages and quotes related to key themes, character insights, new interpretations, or any additional context provided by peers or instructors. Avoid overannotating; your notes should serve as a guideline for your writing once you finish the book. If the whole book is underlined, you'll miss out on valuable insights. Having a solid grasp of literary vocabulary, such as metaphor, allegory, irony, and foreshadowing, is the best way to effectively communicate your points when writing or talking about a book. Moreover, this helps you understand the novel as you're reading. Theme: The overarching ideas, morals, or thoughts in the novel, like the struggle between good and evil or the journey of self-discovery. Metaphor: Comparing two dissimilar things by suggesting they are alike, such as \"the world is a stage\" or \"time is a thief.\" Motif: A repeated idea, image, or flavor in a book, like the recurring use of darkness or light to symbolize knowledge or ignorance. Allusion: A reference to another work, either directly or indirectly, such as mentioning \"Pandora's box\" to signify unforeseen consequences. Symbolism: When an object in the book stands for the idea of something else, like a dove representing peace or chains symbolizing oppression. Consider how the story is told: Is there humor? Is it mostly serious? Are the sentences long and complex, or short and quick? Consider exploring beyond the basics of 'what happened' to 'why it happened.' Do you think the author was influenced by other writers, artists, or current events? If so, how do they use fiction to really explore those influences, such as incorporating modern societal issues or historical events? The answers to these questions may be diverse, but you need to ask them to get the most out of the novel. You cannot only worry about plot when reading, as plot is just one of the many pieces that make up a novel, such as character development, setting, thematic depth, narrative style, and dialogue. Consider reading summaries before starting a book, as some teachers recommend. Novels work on two levels: The first level is 'function,' concerning what the novel aims to convey, including plot, theme, and setting. The second level, 'form,' pertains to how the story is presented, such as through perspective, structure, and metaphor. Consider how form enhances function in a novel. In 'Infinite Jest,' David Foster Wallace explores the nature of entertainment, debating whether one must work for entertainment. The novel's use of footnotes reflects the complexity of the theme, requiring the reader to flip back and forth, even within sentences and between other footnotes, which mirrors the effort required to understand the complexities of entertainment itself. Even less serious books must integrate form and function to be successful, such as 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' which uses its humorous tone to explore the absurdity of life. In 'Dracula,' the story is told through a series of letters and first-hand documents instead of a traditional narrator. Consider exploring the context surrounding the book, as it is one of the best ways to expand your knowledge. You could research historical background information, such as societal norms during the book's setting, or delve into the author's own life and inspirations, including personal experiences that influenced their writing. You could read critical essays, which are common for 'classic' books like those analyzing 'Moby Dick,' and can help make sense of complex novels, as well as essays on 'Pride and Prejudice' or '1984.' Consider consulting the ideas of other writers when forming your arguments early on."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 34.400691986083984, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -1.8586655855178833, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Taking good notes while reading a novel for class is crucial, especially if you'll be writing an essay on it later.

On paper, document significant moments and shifts, tracking character developments, overarching themes, and passages or moments that are not yet clear. During class discussions, take notes on important pages and quotes you might have missed. Avoid overloading your notes; they should serve as a useful guide for your writing when you finish the book. If everything is underlined, the notes won't be very helpful.\n\nHaving a strong grasp of literary vocabulary enhances your ability to articulate your points when writing or discussing a book. It also deepens your understanding of the novel as you read, allowing you to identify and name various techniques and moments, thus improving your note-taking. Here are some key literary terms:\n\n- **Theme**: The central ideas, morals, or messages of the novel. These can range from simple (\"good triumphs over evil\") to complex (\"capitalism is undermining the modern family\").\n- **Metaphor**: A figure of speech that equates two unlike things, suggesting they are alike. For example, \"She is a rose\" indicates beauty, delicacy, and perhaps a hint of danger, without literally meaning she is a flower. A \"simile\" uses \"like\" or \"as,\" such as \"She is like a rose\" or \"She is as pretty as a rose.\"\n- **Motif**: A recurring idea, image, or element within a book. For instance, a book with frequent sailing and ocean imagery might be said to have a \"nautical motif.\"\n- **Allusion**: A reference to another work, either directly or indirectly. For example, a character who dies and is resurrected (as in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" or \"Harry Potter\") is often considered an allusion to Jesus Christ.\n- **Symbolism**: When an object in the book represents a larger idea. Symbolism can be pervasive, as humans naturally think in terms of symbols. For instance, in \"Of Mice and Men,\" the rabbit farm symbolizes Lenny's dreams of financial security and safety.\n\nWhen analyzing a novel, consider the storytelling approach: Is it humorous or serious? Are the sentences complex and lengthy or short and brisk? Move beyond the basics of \"what happened\" to explore \"why it happened.\" Consider whether the author was influenced by other writers, artists, or current events, and examine how they use fiction to explore these influences. There are no definitive answers, but these questions help you engage more deeply with the novel. \n\nDon't focus solely on plot, as it is just one component of a novel. Some teachers recommend reading summaries before starting the book, which can help you focus on characters, themes, and structure since you already know the plot's outcome. Novels operate on two levels: \"function,\" which involves what the novel aims to convey (plot, theme, setting), and \"form,\" which is how it conveys it (perspective, structure, metaphor). Good readers will note each aspect, but excellent readers will observe how the two intersect. Consider how form reinforces function. For example, David Foster Wallace's \"Infinite Jest\" explores the nature of entertainment, requiring effort from the reader by including extensive footnotes. Even less serious novels must integrate form and function to succeed. \"Dracula,\" for instance, unfolds through letters and firsthand documents, enhancing the horror and creating a sense of realism.\n\nTo broaden your understanding of a book, research the historical context or the author's life and inspirations, and read critical essays, which are often available for classic works and can help clarify complex novels. When writing longer papers, engaging with other writers' thoughts can help you formulate your arguments. Do you agree and have additional evidence to offer? Do you disagree and can use the book to argue your point? Always cite any external sources, and expand on them with your personal insights. Use these sources as a springboard for your own arguments, rather than relying solely on them."}}

Many existing multilingual systems focus on downstream NLP tasks that rely heavily on upstream linguistic features. These features range from basic elements like token and sentence boundaries in raw text to more complex structures such as part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency trees (collectively known as fundamental NLP tasks). Developing effective pipelines for these fundamental tasks can significantly enhance multilingual downstream systems.\n\nSeveral NLP toolkits address multilingualism in fundamental NLP tasks, including spaCy, UDify (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), Flair (Akbik et al., 2019), CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), UDPipe (Straka, 2018), and Stanza (Qi et al., 2020). However, each of these toolkits has limitations. For example, spaCy prioritizes speed, which compromises performance. UDify and Flair require external tokenizers and cannot process raw text. While CoreNLP handles raw text, it does not achieve state-of-the-art performance. UDPipe and Stanza, on the other hand, utilize word embeddings like word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) to achieve state-of-the-art performance across many languages. Nonetheless, their pipelines for different languages are trained independently and do not share components, particularly the embedding layers, which significantly contribute to model size. This leads to high memory usage when multiple languages are processed simultaneously, such as in language learning applications.\n\nImportantly, none of these toolkits have fully explored the potential of contextualized embeddings from pretrained transformer-based language models, which have been shown to enhance NLP task performance significantly (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b; Conneau et al., 2020). In this paper, we introduce Trankit, a multilingual transformer-based NLP toolkit that addresses these limitations. Trankit can process raw text for fundamental NLP tasks and supports 56 languages with 90 pre-trained pipelines based on 90 treebanks from the Universal Dependency v2.5 (Zeman et al., 2019). By leveraging the state-of-the-art multilingual pretrained transformer XLM-Roberta (Conneau et al., 2020), Trankit improves performance in sentence segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, morphological tagging, and dependency parsing, while also achieving competitive or superior results in tokenization, multi-word token expansion, and lemmatization across the 90 treebanks. Additionally, it delivers competitive or enhanced performance for named entity recognition (NER) on 11 public datasets.\n\nUnlike previous approaches, Trankit's token and sentence splitter is wordpiece-based rather than character-based, allowing it to better utilize contextual information, which is advantageous in many languages. For instance, when processing the sentence \"John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out an excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah,\" Trankit correctly identifies it as a single sentence, whereas character-based splitters in Stanza and UDPipe might incorrectly split it into two due to the exclamation mark.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first successful implementation of a wordpiece-based token and sentence splitter for 56 languages. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the Trankit pipeline, which includes three novel transformer-based components: (i) a joint token and sentence splitter, (ii) a joint model for POS tagging, morphological tagging, and dependency parsing, and (iii) a named entity recognizer.\n\nOne challenge in using a large pretrained transformer model like XLM-Roberta in Trankit is GPU memory usage. Different transformer-based components need to be loaded into memory simultaneously to handle multilingual tasks. This can be memory-intensive if different versions of the large pretrained transformer (fine-tuned for each component) are used. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-and-play mechanism with Adapters. Adapters are small networks integrated into all layers of the pretrained transformer model, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional fine-tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020a,b).\n\nIn Trankit, a set of adapters for transformer layers and task-specific weights for final predictions are created for each transformer-based component and language. A single large multilingual pretrained transformer is shared across components and languages. Adapters enable the learning of language-specific features for tasks. During training, the shared pretrained transformer remains fixed, while only the adapters and task-specific weights are updated. At inference time, depending on the input text's language and the active component, the trained adapter and task-specific weights are activated and integrated into the pipeline to process the input. This mechanism not only resolves the memory issue but also significantly reduces training time."}}

Alternatively, you might decide to maintain your current job while developing your accounting business during non-work hours. If you are currently an accountant, proceed cautiously because your employer may not appreciate you setting up a new business as a competitor. Partnering with an established accounting professional can help you get your business off the ground; furthermore, collaborating with a partner means gaining more industry connections and accessing more capital. Reach out to people who have recently started their own accounting businesses and schedule a lunch; afterward, explain that you want to start a business and ask if they are open to bringing on a partner. Choose your partners wisely; an ideal partner should complement your skills, and you should also agree on the direction of your accounting business. If you don\u2019t see eye to eye, forming a partnership could create future problems; on the other hand, buying an existing accounting practice might be the easiest option. Consequently, you will already have a built-in client list and visibility in the community; nevertheless, buying an existing practice is usually an expensive option. Therefore, make sure that you can spread out the purchase price over several years; if you decide to go down this route, you must thoroughly investigate the business. Ensure their niche aligns with your interests, and remember that writing a business plan is essential if you need funding. Lenders will only extend a loan after reviewing your business plan; additionally, writing a business plan is a valuable exercise because it forces you to focus on the nuts and bolts of your business. Your business plan should include the following parts: an executive summary, which should be a one- or two-page summary of your entire business plan. In the company description, explain your business structure and its fit within the accounting industry; also, identify your goals or objectives. Regarding organization details, if your business is large, provide an organization chart of departments and key employees; moreover, include background information about your management team. When creating a financial plan, you should project your finances for the next few years, as these financial projections are especially important if you need funding.

However, crafting a business plan is beneficial in itself, as it forces you to focus on your business's intricacies. Your plan should include the following components:\n\n1. **Executive Summary**: A concise one- or two-page overview of your entire business plan, written last but placed first.\n   \n2. **Company Description**: Detail your business structure, its place in the accounting industry, and identify your goals or objectives.\n\n3. **Products and Services**: Describe your accounting services and highlight what sets you apart.\n\n4. **Marketing and Sales Analysis**: Identify your competitors and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Develop a profile of your ideal client, considering factors like age, income, education, and location.\n\n5. **Organization Details**: For larger businesses, provide an organizational chart and key employee information. Include background details about your management team.\n\n6. **Financial Plan**: Project your finances for the coming years, particularly important if you need funding.\n\nAccountants generally require minimal equipment, but you should budget for essentials such as a computer, printer, telephone, fax machine, copier, and accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks Pro).\n\nA mentor can be invaluable, offering guidance and a sounding board for ideas. Finding a more experienced accountant to act as your mentor can be especially beneficial, especially if you prefer not to enter a partnership.

These marks are not part of the spelling but serve as pronunciation guides. When writing Latin, these marks are usually omitted. To pronounce \"love\" correctly in Latin, focus on the long vowels:\n\n- \u0101: as in the English \"father,\" not [\u00e6] in \"fat,\" or [\u0259] in \"apart.\"\n- \u0113: as in the English \"they,\" but longer, not the [ei] as \"ey\" in \"they,\" or [\u0259] in \"apart,\" or [i:] in \"ecology.\"\n- \u012b: as in the English \"sheep,\" not as [ai].\n- \u014d: as in the Italian \"\u00f3\" in \"amore.\"\n- \u016b: as in English \"root,\" not as [ju:] \"you,\" or French \"u,\" German \"\u00fc.\"\n\nThe infinitive form of the Latin verb \"to love\" is \"am\u0101re,\" which serves as the base for conjugation into other forms. Latin grammar can be complex, with various conjugations significantly affecting the word. Here are the main present tense conjugations:\n\n- First person singular: \"am\u014d\"\n- Second person singular: \"am\u0101s\"\n- Third person singular: \"amat\"\n- First person plural: \"am\u0101mus\"\n- Second person plural: \"am\u0101tis\"\n- Third person plural: \"amant\"\n\nLatin has six tenses, three of which (imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect) refer to past actions. The imperfect tense describes ongoing past actions, the perfect tense indicates completed past actions, and the pluperfect describes actions occurring before other past actions. Here is \"love\" in the first person singular through first person plural for these tenses:\n\n- Imperfect: \"am\u0101bam\" \u2013 \"am\u0101b\u0101s\" \u2013 \"am\u0101bat\" \u2013 \"am\u0101b\u0101mus\"\n- Perfect: \"am\u0101v\u012b\" \u2013 \"am\u0101vist\u012b\" \u2013 \"am\u0101vit\" \u2013 \"am\u0101vimus\"\n- Pluperfect: \"am\u0101veram\" \u2013 \"am\u0101ver\u0101s\" \u2013 \"am\u0101verat\" \u2013 \"am\u0101ver\u0101mus\"\n\nFor future actions, Latin uses the future and future perfect tenses. The future perfect describes actions that will be completed in the future, while the future tense describes upcoming actions. Here is \"love\" in these tenses:\n\n- Future: \"am\u0101b\u014d\" \u2013 \"am\u0101bis\" \u2013 \"am\u0101bit\" \u2013 \"am\u0101bimus\"\n- Future Perfect: \"am\u0101ver\u014d\" \u2013 \"am\u0101veris\" \u2013 \"am\u0101verit\" \u2013 \"am\u0101verimus\"\n\nLatin's complex grammar includes additional conjugations and variations in verb forms. In addition to the six tenses and three persons (first, second, and third), Latin verbs have four moods (indicative, infinitive, subjunctive, imperative) and two voices (active, passive). Mastering these variations is crucial for understanding Latin's essence and stylistics.\n\n\"Love\" is also a noun in Latin, specifically a masculine noun with the nominative singular form \"amor.\" Like verbs, nouns have variations based on case and number. Here are the forms for nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, and vocative cases:\n\n- Singular: \"amor\" \u2013 \"amoris\" \u2013 \"amori\" \u2013 \"amorem\" \u2013 \"amore\" \u2013 \"amor\"\n- Plural: \"amores\" \u2013 \"amorum\" \u2013 \"amoribus\" \u2013 \"amores\" \u2013 \"amoribus\" \u2013 \"amores\""}}

For a simple, solid-colored dress, consider a floral blazer in rich jewel tones for extra flair.\n\nWinter weddings often present challenges like icy sidewalks or snowy parking lots, making stilettos impractical. Instead, choose shoes that are easier to walk in, such as velvet wedges or peep-toe kitten heels. Embellished ballet flats or satin-covered ones are also excellent choices.

For example, embedding the names of English songs and movies in Chinese responses not only improves comprehension but also enhances user experience by making interactions more relatable, bridging cultural gaps, and increasing engagement through the inclusion of recognizable cultural references that resonate with users and make communication more engaging and meaningful. A straightforward way to build a bilingual TTS system is by collecting speech data from bilingual speakers, ensuring authentic pronunciation and intonation, which significantly enhances the system\u2019s accuracy and naturalness in both languages. [1] proposed a bilingual TTS system based on a shared hidden Markov model, using a Mandarin-English corpus recorded by a bilingual speaker to integrate language features for improved synthesis. [2] presented a TTS system using a deep neural network that separately factors speaker and language characteristics, which allows for tailored customization to various bilingual speakers by adjusting the model to accommodate individual speaker traits and the unique nuances of each language, ensuring a more personalized and accurate synthesis. Mixed-lingual corpora, which include multiple languages within the same dataset, are rare due to their complex linguistic structure, whereas monolingual corpora, consisting of a single language, are more readily available and easier to source because of their uniform linguistic content. Another approach is to leverage monolingual speech data from different speakers, which provides greater diversity and an increased volume of training data, thereby enhancing the system's robustness and adaptability to various linguistic contexts, making it more versatile in handling different language scenarios by exposing the system to a wide range of pronunciations and accents. [5] proposes a polyglot synthesis method that adapts shared HMM states to the target speaker, optimizing performance by efficiently utilizing monolingual corpora to improve speech synthesis across languages and tailoring the output to match the unique characteristics of the target speaker, thereby achieving a more natural and personalized speech output."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 54.534664154052734, "some": 0.8757344881693522, "bart": -1.4981566667556763, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "In today's world, bilingual text-to-speech (TTS) systems have become essential for various applications, such as voice assistants. For instance, English song and movie titles are often seamlessly integrated into Chinese responses. One straightforward method to develop a bilingual TTS system is by gathering speech data from bilingual speakers. In [1], a shared hidden Markov model (HMM)-based bilingual TTS system was introduced, utilizing a Mandarin-English corpus recorded by a bilingual speaker. Meanwhile, [2] presented a TTS system employing a speaker and language factorized deep neural network (DNN) with data from three bilingual speakers. However, while mixed-lingual corpora are rare, monolingual corpora are readily available. An alternative approach involves leveraging monolingual speech data from various speakers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In [5], a polyglot synthesis method was proposed, adapting shared HMM states to the target speaker using monolingual corpora. Similarly, [6] suggested a speaker and language factorization based on an HMM-based parametric TTS system. [7] used a combined phonetic space from two languages to create a code-switched TTS system based on HMM. Meanwhile, [8] mapped the senones between two monolingual corpora using a speaker-independent DNN ASR output based on HMM TTS. End-to-end TTS systems also extend to multilingual tasks using monolingual speech data [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For example, [13] utilized Unicode bytes as a unified language representation for multilingual TTS, employing 125 hours of speech to handle code-switching text, despite facing speaker inconsistency across languages. [14] incorporated designed loss terms to preserve speaker identity across multiple languages, based on the VoiceLoop architecture [17], using recordings from 410 monolingual speakers in English, Spanish, and German. [15] applied an adversarial loss term to separate speaker identity from speech content, training with 550 hours of speech from 92 monolingual speakers. Due to corpus size limitations, [16] introduced tone embedding and a tone classifier to preserve tone and generate utterances with appropriate prosodic accents in the target language. Typically, individual speakers only speak one language, resulting in a strong correlation between speaker and language characteristics. Using solely monolingual corpora for bilingual or multilingual TTS can lead to noticeable accent carry-over in synthesized speech or inconsistent voice across languages. Bilingual corpora can effectively address this issue. For instance, [18] trained a TTS system that transforms speaker embedding between languages from a bilingual speaker to other monolingual speakers, achieving a high degree of naturalness. In this paper, we aim to utilize limited bilingual corpora to produce more standard spoken English from a monolingual speaker, which is closely linked to phonology learning. In mixed-lingual utterances, non-native English speakers, such as Chinese speakers, often pronounce English influenced by their native language, leading to deviations from standard English pronunciation [19]. Mandarin pronunciation is directly derived from word spellings with different tones, resulting in a high grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) correlation. In contrast, English is an alphabetic language with low phonemic transparency. Consequently, native speakers of phonemic languages, whose pronunciation is influenced by spelling, often pronounce English words differently from native English speakers [20]. In mixed-lingual utterances, these speakers, even if qualified bilingual, typically substitute some English phonemes with the closest phoneme in their native language, causing mispronunciations and phonological differences such as articulation changes and intonation variations [21]. Given these challenges, creating a state-of-the-art bilingual TTS system requires specialized designs to address phonological differences between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances. In this paper, our contributions include: (1) introducing phonology embedding to capture English differences between mixed-lingual and monolingual utterances; (2) proposing an embedding mask for language embedding to distinguish information between different languages and for phonology embedding to focus on expression between different phonologies of English; (3) designing an embedding strength modulator (ESM) to capture dynamic language and phonology information, aiding in generating more standard spoken English; and (4) conducting experiments demonstrating that static and dynamic components in ESM can control different phonological attributes. Phonology decomposition and control contribute to more standard spoken English expression and improved performance across different scenarios.\n\nFig. 1: Overview of the proposed bilingual architecture with specially designed modules highlighted in yellow."}}

Then, tilt the clinometer until you can look through the straw or paper tube. Once aligned, identify the top of a tall object you want to measure, such as a building. This method allows you to measure the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object, which can then be used to determine the object's height. Keep the clinometer steady in its current position until the dangling string becomes still. To determine the angle, subtract the degree where the string crosses the rim from 90\u00ba, which is the midpoint of the protractor. For example, if the string crosses the rim at 60\u00ba, the angle of elevation between you and the top of the object is calculated as 90 - 60 = 30\u00ba. Conversely, if the string crosses the rim at 150\u00ba, the angle of elevation is 150 - 90 = 60\u00ba. The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba because 90\u00ba points directly upward. Therefore, the result will always be a positive number (greater than 0\u00ba). If your subtraction results in a negative number, remove the minus sign to obtain the correct answer. For instance, if you calculate 60 - 90 = -30\u00ba, the actual angle of elevation is +30\u00ba. The tangent of an angle is determined by dividing the length of the opposite side of a right triangle by the length of the adjacent side. In this scenario, the triangle consists of three points: you, the base of the object, and the top of the object. Here, the 'opposite' side refers to the object's height, and the 'adjacent' side is the distance from you to the object's base. You can determine the tangent using a scientific or graphing calculator, an online tangent calculator, or a chart listing tangents for different angles. To find the tangent using a calculator, press the TAN button and enter the angle you determined. If the result is outside the range of 0 to 1, switch your calculator to degrees instead of radians and try again. To determine the object's height, you need to know the distance from its base to you. For accuracy, use a tape measure. If you don\u2019t have a tape measure, count your steps to the object and measure the length of one step with a ruler. The total distance is calculated by multiplying the length of one step by the number of steps you took. Additionally, some protractors come with rulers marked along the straight edge. Remember, the tangent of your angle represents the ratio of the object's height to the distance between you and the object. Multiply the tangent by the measured distance to determine the object's height. For instance, if the angle of elevation is 35\u00ba and your distance from the object is 45 units, the object's height is 45 times the tangent of 35\u00ba, which is approximately 31.5 units. Finally, add your height at eye level to your calculation to account for the clinometer's height above the ground."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 28.734384536743164, "some": 0.9471389452616373, "bart": -1.817010760307312, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "To measure the height of a tall object using a clinometer, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Position the Clinometer**: Hold the clinometer so that the curved edge of the protractor is facing downward.

Note where the string crosses the protractor's rim. Calculate the angle of elevation by subtracting this reading from 90\u00ba. For instance, if the string crosses at 60\u00ba, the angle is 90\u00ba - 60\u00ba = 30\u00ba. If it crosses at 150\u00ba, the angle is 150\u00ba - 90\u00ba = 60\u00ba. The angle of elevation will always be less than 90\u00ba because 90\u00ba is directly overhead. If your subtraction results in a negative number, simply remove the negative sign.

Start by selecting the length of your cassette tape. The most suitable lengths for a mixtape are 60 minutes (30 minutes per side) or 90 minutes (45 minutes per side). It's best to avoid 120-minute cassettes, as their sound quality is notably inferior.\n\nOnce you have your playlist ready (you can find some inspiration below), organize your recorded music in a stack so that you can easily work through it from top to bottom while making your mixtape. This approach will help you maintain focus and avoid losing track of your progress. If possible, note the duration of each track, as this will assist you in arranging your songs around the midpoint of the tape.\n\nIf your music collection is primarily digital but you still want to create an old-fashioned cassette mixtape, don't worry. You can burn the desired songs onto blank CDs using your computer's optical recording drive and then transfer the music from the CDs to the cassette. Make sure to burn a music disc rather than a data disc, as data discs may not be compatible with all stereos. Alternatively, if you can connect your MP3 player to your stereo, you can record directly from it onto the tape. Keep in mind that this method may result in slightly lower sound quality compared to using CDs. Most cassette players have cords that facilitate this process.\n\nWhenever possible, use an integrated setup. Many stereo and hi-fi systems produced over the past few decades include a cassette recorder built into one of their tape decks. Look for the tape deck with an extra button, often marked with a red dot. Allow the tape to play for a few seconds until you hear a smooth hiss, then stop it. Insert the album you want to record from into the appropriate player on the stereo or hi-fi. For CDs, pause playback and skip tracks until you find the desired track. For other cassettes, fast-forward to the song, then stop or pause the tape. For LPs, leave the dust cover up and wait briefly.\n\nPress the \"record\" button on the recorder deck (which will automatically engage the \"play\" button) and start playing your chosen song. Recording first ensures that the beginning of the song isn't clipped off. If you're recording from an LP, position the needle just before the song you want to capture, and once the record reaches the silent space between tracks, press \"record\" on the tape deck. Stay near the stereo and press the \"stop\" button on the recorder deck as soon as the song finishes to halt the recording. You can then stop the first album and swap it for the next song on your mixtape list.\n\nWhen the cassette reaches the end of the first side, flip it over and continue recording on the other side. Listen to your mixtape from start to finish to ensure that everything recorded correctly. If a song didn't turn out as expected, re-record that section until you are satisfied. Unless you meticulously managed your time, you might end up with part of a song at the end of the first side. You can erase songs by recording over them with no music playing. Finally, consider adding cover art, decorations, and other finishing touches to personalize your mixtape."}}

Our culture often overemphasizes humility, encouraging you to downplay your achievements by saying, 'Oh, it wasn't that significant. Besides, many others contributed.' Resist this impulse! Accepting compliments is important because it acknowledges your accomplishments. Embrace and appreciate the praise; you have earned it! We all need to recognize our achievements occasionally, as self-recognition fosters confidence and motivation. When others offer compliments, accept them graciously, as they genuinely wish to express their admiration. Your friends are planning a pizza and beer night on Thursday at your place because of the large-screen TV, but you have promised yourself a gym visit and have other commitments you'd prefer not to break, so they can find another venue. It's important to prioritize your plans, as maintaining personal goals is vital for well-being. You have fitness goals to achieve, and prioritizing your physical health is essential for a balanced lifestyle. It is acceptable to inconvenience others occasionally for your personal well-being. If you are a vegetarian and your friends are ordering pizza, communicate your dietary preference. Their desire for pepperoni is not more important than your dietary needs. With Thanksgiving approaching, consider how this holiday aligns with your lifestyle choices. While others enjoy turkey, feel free to create your own alternative dish. Compromises are easily attainable in such situations."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 29.20572853088379, "some": 0.8967951138814291, "bart": -1.7631146907806396, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "The world will do everything it can to fit you into its mold, dictating what's practical and acceptable, and daring you not to listen. Resist! Do you dream of moving to New York, becoming a go-go dancer, and living on Ramen noodles? If that's your passion, pursue it. As the saying goes, those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter. Passion enriches everyone, so find yours and hold onto it. If the world mocks you, you're with the wrong crowd. You're at your best when you're happiest, so follow your passions regardless of what others may think, do, or say.\n\nBeing selfish in the right way is an art. It involves discerning when what's best for you aligns with what's best for the situation. It's understanding when your desires are unjustified versus when they contribute to your contentment. If you refuse to let a friend choose the movie, you're being controlling. But if you miss her dance recital to work an extra shift to pay the electric bill, you're being practical. Know the difference. This applies not only with others but also with yourself. There are times to be selfish and times when you shouldn't be.\n\nConsider if moving in with someone you met online who lives in Australia is wise, or if working with Habitat for Humanity, which offers a scholarship, is a better choice. Sometimes what's best for you isn't what you want now but will be in the future. Occasionally, it's best to shut out the world and enjoy some well-deserved \"me time\" \u2014 it might be the only remedy. Take time each day, whether at home, work, or during a run, to focus on yourself. Destressing boosts productivity, so try meditation, yoga, or a simple walk. If that's not possible, spend 10 minutes at your desk daydreaming. This downtime will energize you and improve your focus for the rest of your responsibilities.\n\nHumility is often emphasized, isn't it? When you're complimented, you're taught to deflect it with, \"Oh, it wasn't that good, and others helped me.\" Stop doing that! Embrace and accept compliments; you've earned them. Everyone deserves a pat on the back occasionally, and if others are willing to give it, let them. They wouldn't compliment you if they didn't want to.\n\nIf friends invite you for pizza and beer on a Thursday when you planned to go to the gym, but they're counting on your place for the big screen TV, remember you have plans. They can gather elsewhere while you burn calories. It's okay to be an inconvenience. If friends are ordering pizza and you're vegetarian, speak up and demand a veggie supreme. Your dietary needs are as important, if not more so, than their pepperoni preference. With Thanksgiving approaching, let them have their turkey, but create your own alternative.

Traditional NER models are limited to a predefined set of entity types, restricting their flexibility and adaptability to new domains, which means they struggle to recognize emerging or specialized entities, often resulting in incomplete or inaccurate data representation, thereby highlighting the need for more adaptable models. Expanding the number of entity types can be beneficial for many applications, as it allows for more accurate and comprehensive data extraction, enhancing the understanding of complex data sets and enabling insights into specialized fields, but may involve labeling additional datasets, thus broadening the scope of data analysis. The emergence of Large Language Models, like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), has introduced a new era for open-type NER by enabling the identification of any entity types through natural language instruction, significantly enhancing flexibility and adaptability and showcasing the powerful potential for innovation in this field, making it possible to handle a wide range of previously unrecognized entities, thus revolutionizing the NER landscape. This shift signifies a significant departure from the inflexibility observed in traditional models, allowing for more dynamic and versatile NER applications, thereby opening new possibilities for tailored entity recognition in diverse contexts and fostering advancements in personalized data processing, thus transforming data interaction. However, powerful LLMs typically consist of billions of parameters and thus require substantial computing resources, posing challenges in terms of accessibility and scalability, as they demand high-performance infrastructure for deployment, making it difficult for smaller organizations to utilize them effectively, thus limiting their broader implementation. Although it is possible to access some LLMs via APIs (OpenAI, 2023), using them at scale can incur high costs due to substantial computational demands, which can be a barrier for widespread adoption, especially for startups and small businesses, thereby restricting innovation. Recently, researchers have explored the finetuning of open-source language models such as Figure 1: BiLM for Open NER, which can reduce costs and improve accessibility, allowing broader access to advanced NER capabilities and democratizing the use of cutting-edge technology, thus enabling more inclusive advancements. Our proposed GLiNER utilizes small bidirectional LMs and treats the NER task as matching entity types with textual spans in a latent space, offering a more efficient and scalable approach, focusing on optimizing performance without the need for extensive computational resources while maintaining high accuracy, thereby providing a practical solution for resource-constrained environments. LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023) has shown significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of named entity recognition tasks, marking an important development in making NER more precise and resource-efficient, thus setting a new benchmark for performance in the field, thereby advancing the state of the art. Wang et al. (2023), for example, introduced InstructUIE, a fine-tuned FlanT5-11B (Raffel et al., 2019; Chung et al., 2022) model on existing information extraction datasets, achieving excellent performance in zero-shot settings, showcasing its adaptability and robustness, which highlights its potential for diverse applications without extensive retraining and underscores its versatility, thus demonstrating its broad applicability. Additionally, GoLLIE (Sainz et al., 2023) was introduced as an extension of InstructUIE work by finetuning a CodeLLaMa (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) using detailed annotation guidelines, resulting in significant performance improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse applications and setting a new standard for NER techniques, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in this domain, thereby enhancing methodological frameworks. Another recent proposal by Zhou et al. (2023), called UniversalNER, involves the fine-tuning of LLMs using diverse data from various domains annotated with ChatGPT instead of relying on standard NER datasets, offering a broader and more adaptable approach to training models, thereby enhancing their ability to generalize across different contexts, thus improving model robustness. This approach enables the replication and even surpassing of the original capability of ChatGPT when evaluated in zero-shot on several NER datasets, indicating its potential to outperform established benchmarks and revolutionize the field with its advanced capabilities, thereby setting new standards. These works have achieved remarkable results but present certain limitations we seek to address. They use autoregressive language models, which can be slow due to their token-by-token generation process, highlighting the need for more efficient processing techniques, thus emphasizing the potential for further optimization. Moreover, they employ large models with several billion parameters, which limits their deployment in compute-limited scenarios, thus necessitating more lightweight yet effective solutions, thereby encouraging innovation in model design. When trained on the dataset released by Zhou et al. (2023), which comprises texts from numerous domains and thousands of entity types, our model demonstrates impressive zero-shot performance, indicating its capacity to generalize and perform well without domain-specific fine-tuning, offering significant scalability and adaptability, thus enhancing versatility. Specifically, it outperforms both ChatGPT and fine-tuned LLMs on zero-shot NER datasets, as shown in Table 1, illustrating the superiority of the proposed model's performance in handling diverse linguistic challenges, thus establishing new benchmarks. Our model\u2019s robustness is further evident in its ability to handle languages not even encountered during training, surpassing ChatGPT in 8 of 10 languages (Table 3) that were not included in its training data, showcasing its exceptional adaptability and cross-lingual capabilities, thus proving its worth in global applications, thereby broadening its impact."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 90.66449737548828, "some": 0.8964251677195231, "bart": -1.5210297107696533, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in numerous real-world applications, such as constructing knowledge graphs.

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmonkeys\u201d (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, marked by denying individuals the capacity to experience pain (Deska et al., 2020). Identifying dehumanizing language is essential for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997). Despite its significance, natural language processing research has largely overlooked dehumanization, primarily due to the limited availability of annotated datasets. Annotating dehumanizing language is challenging because of its complexity, abstractness, and subtlety. This study assesses the ability of state-of-the-art NLP models, specifically GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2, to accurately identify dehumanizing language (Touvron et al., 2023). Our analysis covers a range of settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting, to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in identifying, recognizing, and distinguishing dehumanizing language. Our results show that the GPT models developed on closed-source platforms significantly outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language.

This phenomenon can range from overt derogation, where victims are likened to \"dogs\" or \"monkeys\" (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond, 2008), to subtler forms, such as denying the capability of experiencing pain to certain individuals (Deska et al., 2020). Identifying dehumanizing language is crucial for understanding and mitigating its effects on collective violence and the manipulation of public perception in conflicts (Oberschall, 1997).\n\nDespite the importance of detecting dehumanization, this nuanced form of hate speech has been relatively overlooked in natural language processing advancements, primarily due to the lack of publicly available, annotated datasets. Annotating dehumanizing language poses unique challenges due to its subjective and abstract nature. This study evaluates the capability of leading pretrained NLP models\u2014specifically, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023a)\u2014in accurately identifying dehumanizing language. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing zero-shot, few-shot, and explainable prompting settings, we assess the effectiveness of these models in recognizing dehumanizing content.\n\nOur findings reveal that the closed-source GPT models notably outperform the open-source LLAMA-2-70B model in identifying dehumanizing language. However, the GPT models demonstrate limitations in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other forms of hate speech, achieving only a 70% accuracy rate for this specific task. Furthermore, our results expose a variable sensitivity across different target groups; GPT models are prone to overclassifying other types of hate speech as dehumanization for certain groups, such as gay and transgender individuals, while failing to adequately identify dehumanizing language targeting other vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and refugees.\n\nFollowing our evaluation, we applied the most effective approach, namely explainable prompting, to automatically generate annotated data for training smaller open-source models. This phase revealed a notable discrepancy: while the initial results from GPT models are promising, the resulting annotations do not meet the expected standards for training high-performing models. Specifically, even the top-performing model only achieved a 61% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from other hate speech types. This finding underscores the fact that annotating nuanced tasks like dehumanization still necessitates the expertise of human annotators. It also highlights that the annotation of large-scale corpora with dehumanization labels represents an important and pivotal future direction for fostering collaboration between the fields of natural language processing and social science, enabling comprehensive research into this profoundly significant social phenomenon."}}

These models are generally pre-trained on vast datasets through unsupervised learning. However, they often require additional training in two main scenarios: 1) continual pre-training on new data as the available pool of pre-training data grows (Gupta et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2023), and 2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on labeled data to improve their ability to follow human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023; Ansell et al., 2024). Unlike initial pre-training, this additional training requires significantly less time and computational resources. Nonetheless, it remains costly, primarily due to the large number of parameters involved (Zhao et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2023).\n\nFortunately, many researchers (Zhao et al., 2024a) are focusing on reducing these additional training costs. Their efforts are largely centered on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods (Ansell et al., 2024; Lialin et al., 2023), which are not typically used in continual pre-training scenarios (Cui et al., 2023). Therefore, it is crucial to explore new acceleration methods that are suitable for both additional training contexts. In this paper, we aim to leverage the structural sparsity (Li et al., 2023b) inherent in pre-trained LLMs to speed up their additional training processes.\n\nResearch has shown (Zhang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2023) that neurons exhibit sparsity in every forward iteration. By skipping the computation for inactive (unimportant) neurons, we can enhance training speed. As illustrated in Figure 1, each neuron corresponds to a column in the weight matrix of a linear layer. During each training iteration, a compact and efficient neuron importance assessment module (depicted on the right) evaluates the activation status of neurons in advance. By eliminating inactive neurons (columns in the weight matrix), we can accelerate training.\n\nBeyond computational speed improvements, omitting inactive neurons poses three additional challenges: 1) determining which neurons to discard, 2) ensuring that discarding neurons does not harm model performance, and 3) evaluating the effectiveness of this approach in real-world additional training scenarios of LLMs. To address the first challenge, we have adapted and extended several well-known neuron importance evaluation metrics (Liu et al., 2023; Han et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2023) within the context of transformer pruning, resulting in the removal of unimportant neurons. Extensive experiments (\u00a7 3.1) on TinyLlama-1.1B (Zhang et al., 2024) helped us establish (\u00a7 2.2) the use of the maxip metric for neuron importance assessment, the adoption of a sampling-based neuron selection strategy (as opposed to top-k), and the introduction of a ladder omission rate scheduler.\n\nFor the latter two challenges, we conducted separate experiments on Llama-2 (7B and 13B) under both standard and sparsity-accelerated conditions for both continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning scenarios (\u00a7 3.2). Evaluation results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach, SAT, achieves comparable, if not superior, performance compared to conventional training methods. Additionally, it results in approximately 45% improvement in throughput for continual pre-training and a 38% reduction in elapsed time for supervised fine-tuning (\u00a7 3.3).\n\nIn summary, this work makes contributions in three key areas: it proposes a novel ladder omission rate scheduler to mitigate SAT's overfitting issues, significantly enhances training speed, and maintains or exceeds standard training performance."}}

Some swimmers find it convenient to swim before work, while others prefer swimming after work, depending on their individual preferences and schedules. A standard 2-hour swim session typically begins with a 15-minute warm-up, followed by 200m of freestyle swimming and additional easy swims at a moderate pace. Hypoxic training, which involves breath-holding during exercise, is typically a 5-minute session that can be incorporated into your swim routine before or after the main set. To improve your swimming, aim to swim 5 sets of 50m freestyle, completing each within 40 seconds and striving for a time of 30 seconds per set, which will help you build endurance and speed. Aim for a good distance per stroke (DPS) and strive to achieve 12-16 strokes in a 25m pool, which will help you swim more efficiently and effectively. Maintaining a steady head position is essential for efficient swimming and will help you swim with greater ease and precision. When swimming underwater, exhale slightly to prevent water from entering your nose and maintain control of your breathing, which is crucial for safe and effective swimming. Developing fluidity in your swimming will take time and consistent practice, but the rewards will be well worth the effort and dedication. When swimming, use your arms to shape an upside-down heart with your hands, which will help you maintain a strong and efficient stroke and improve your overall swimming technique. To maintain a strong stroke, use your elbows to guide your hands forward, which will help you swim with greater efficiency, power, and speed. Try focusing on one stroke for a week, and then switch to a different stroke the following week, which will help you develop a well-rounded and varied swimming routine. As you approach the 'big T,' keep your chin tucked to your chest while swimming, which will help you maintain a streamlined position and swim with greater ease and precision. When performing a flip, keep your eyes on the wall and avoid looking up until you've completed the turn, which will help you swim with greater efficiency, accuracy, and speed. The wall will always be visible if you keep your eyes on the 'big T' at the bottom of the pool, which will help you navigate the pool with greater ease and confidence.

Determine what time works best for you. Some people find it helpful to swim before work, while others benefit more from swimming after work. It all depends on your schedule. Your body will need time to establish the rhythm between your strokes and breathing. When you're just starting out, aim to swim for at least 10 minutes, three to five times a week. Gradually increase this to thirty minutes or more.\n\nA typical 2-hour swim session might look like this:\n\n- **Warm-up (15 minutes):** Start with 200m freestyle, followed by easy swims at a steady pace, focusing on applying constant, strong pressure with each movement.\n  \n- **Kick or Pull (15 minutes):** This helps to loosen up your muscles and warm up your legs, establishing a rhythm.\n  \n- **Hypoxic Training (5 minutes):** Usually done before or after the main set, hypoxic training involves holding your breath under exertion. You can do sprints while taking only 1 or 2 breaths per length, or perform a butterfly kick underwater up to halfway, then switch to butterfly, breathing every 3 strokes. Avoid prolonged hypoxic training if you have a main set afterward.\n  \n- **Main Set (35 minutes):** This involves either high-intensity short lengths with fast times or lower intensity with many laps without rest. An example is 5 x 50m freestyle on 40 seconds with a target time of 30 seconds.\n  \n- **Warm-down:** This is crucial for recovery and muscle stretching. Aim for a good DPS (distance per stroke), doing as few strokes per lap as possible (12-16 in a 25m pool). Focus on both your inhalations and exhalations. When you're not breathing, keep your head still. Only turn your head to breathe. Many swimmers struggle with exhaling underwater, so make sure to exhale slightly when submerging to maintain proper breathing and prevent water from entering your nose. Always turn your head to the side to breathe, keeping one goggle in the water and the other out to avoid over-turning your head. Try to breathe every three or five strokes to ensure you're breathing on both sides of your body. Avoid holding your breath.\n\nThe backstroke can be one of the most challenging strokes, requiring strong back and shoulder muscles. The key to a fluid backstroke is in your hips. Practice flutter kicks on your back with one arm raised, switching arms after a lap, and finish with a lap of normal backstroke.\n\nThe breaststroke relies on synchronizing your glide and stroke, a fluidity that takes time to develop. Pulling harder or trying to pull more water can be counterproductive. Always perform a pullout to gain an initial advantage, which is crucial for a strong and fast breaststroke. Instead of pushing water behind you, focus on shaping an upside-down heart with your hands, bringing them together as you extend forward. Use your elbows, not your arms, to push your hands forward.\n\nIf you dedicate an entire day to one stroke, you'll synchronize with its rhythm faster. You might even focus on one stroke for an entire week before switching to another. This can enhance your speed in doing laps.\n\nWhen approaching the end of the lane in a lap pool, look for the \"big T,\" the perpendicular line at the lane's end. As your head crosses the T, tuck your chin to your chest while following through with a stroke, then use a dolphin kick for a final push. Don't look up before flipping; the wall will always be there if you focus on the \"big T\" at the bottom of the pool. This maneuver can be challenging, so it's recommended to have someone show you firsthand how to do it. To go faster, perform a couple of dolphin kicks underwater in a streamline position, aiming to pass the flags above the pool if possible."}}

We critically analyze various techniques and architectures developed to adapt LLMs to the constraints of edge computing. This includes a detailed examination of model compression techniques, energy-efficient computing strategies, and the development of novel lightweight model architectures. Furthermore, we delve into deployment strategies that enable the effective use of LLMs in edge scenarios, highlighting key industry applications and their resulting benefits.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: We begin by exploring the foundations and preliminaries in Section 2, including the evolution of on-device LLMs, architectural foundations, and on-device training techniques. Section 3 delves into efficient architectures for on-device language models, discussing innovative design principles, model compression, and collaborative approaches. Section 4 provides an in-depth examination of model compression and optimization techniques, covering quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization. Section 5 investigates hardware acceleration and deployment strategies, highlighting popular on-device LLM frameworks and hardware-specific optimizations. In Section 6, we present examples of existing on-device language models and their real-world applications across various domains. Finally, Section 7 discusses future directions and open challenges in the field, and Section 8 concludes our review.\n\nBy focusing on the intersection of LLM capabilities and edge computing requirements, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse in AI research, offering a comprehensive perspective on achieving the delicate balance between model performance and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments."}}

These include applications such as speech recognition, information extraction, machine translation, and document classification. In all cases, a language model is used in combination with other information sources to rank competing hypotheses by assigning them some probabilities. There are classical techniques for constructing language models, such as unigram, bigram, and trigram models with various smoothing techniques like Laplace smoothing and Kneser-Ney smoothing (see Chen and Goodman, 1998, and the references therein for a survey and comparison of these techniques). In some recent text and speech processing applications, new challenges arise related to the construction of language models. We are developing new and efficient algorithms to address these more general problems. Classical language models: Classical language models are constructed by deriving statistics from large input texts. Moreover, in speech mining applications or for adaptation purposes, one often needs to construct a language model based on the complex output of a speech recognition system. A word lattice, which is a weighted finite automaton (WFA) output by the recognizer for a particular utterance, provides a structured and nuanced representation. It typically includes a comprehensive and detailed set of alternative transcription sentences for that utterance, with corresponding weights or probabilities. A critical step in constructing a language model based on a word lattice is to compute the statistics for any given sequence from the lattices or WFAs output by the recognizer. This task is challenging because it cannot be done by simply enumerating each path of the lattice and counting the number of occurrences of the sequence considered in each path, as even a small automaton may have more than four billion paths. We have developed a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the expected count of any given sequence in a WFA and have reported experimental results demonstrating its efficiency. The representation of language models using WFAs: Classical n-gram language models naturally represent WFAs in which each state encodes a left context of width less than n. However, the sheer magnitude of that representation makes it highly impractical for offline optimizations, such as those used in large-vocabulary speech recognition or general information extraction systems. Most offline representations of these models are based instead on approximations like pruning and quantization to limit their size. We introduce a novel technique for creating an exact representation of n-gram language models by WFAs, whose size is practical for offline use even in tasks with a vocabulary size of about 500,000 words and for n = 6. Advanced class-based models: In many applications, it is advantageous and efficient to construct class-based language models, that is, models based on classes of words (Brown et al., 1992). Such models are often more robust, as they can include unseen words that belong to a class but were not found in the corpus, thus improving generalization in terms of coverage and adaptability. Classical class-based models are based on straightforward classes, such as a list of words. However, new clustering algorithms, like k-means and hierarchical clustering, allow one to create more general and more complex classes that may be regular languages.

(2023), and Zhang et al. (2023a), have become transformative tools in natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating exceptional skill across a wide range of tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs can sometimes produce responses that, although they appear coherent, deviate from the truth, a phenomenon known as 'hallucinations' (Ji et al.). In addition to undermining the reliability of LLMs, these inaccuracies create significant challenges for their use in critical fields. The root causes of these hallucinations are still being actively researched. Contributing factors may include the models' tendency to rely excessively on their own outputs and prioritize fluency over accuracy, as well as the inherent uncertainties in the knowledge they acquire during training. The implications of hallucinations are serious, as they can lead to misinformation, reduce trust in AI technologies, and cause harm in sensitive decision-making situations. To tackle this issue, particularly in the context of Question Answering (QA), the academic community has worked extensively on strategies to reduce hallucinations. Previous research (Qiu et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023; Kai et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024) has shown that it is possible to significantly reduce hallucinations without major structural changes or comprehensive retraining of the models. However, many methods either subtly modify LLM behavior within the latent space or focus on preventing unfaithful outputs during decoding, frequently treating LLMs as black boxes. In contrast, our research proposes a new method, called Faithful Finetuning (F2), that enhances response fidelity through the careful design of explicit loss functions during the fine-tuning process. We start by decomposing the traditional QA objective into two clear sub-objectives: internal fact retrieval and fact-grounded QA, enabling the LLM to use its internal knowledge more effectively for accurate answers. We then develop a targeted fine-tuning method to concentrate the model's attention on the key areas identified by entity-based and attention-based heuristics within the retrieved fact spans. Additionally, to minimize model hallucinations, we identify the layers in the LLM structure that are prone to hallucinations and conduct targeted fine-tuning on them. Empirical evaluations on the TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) and FACTOR (Muhlgay et al., 2024) datasets, widely used in LLM hallucination studies (Zhang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024), demonstrate that our approach shows significant improvement compared to standard models.

It is dedicated to studying frameworks such as probabilistic models, neural networks, and rule-based systems, which include techniques like Bayesian inference, backpropagation, and pattern matching, that enable effective communication between humans and computers using natural language, focusing on their ability to model linguistic nuances like idioms and context-dependent meanings. As a multidisciplinary field, NLP integrates linguistics, computer science, and mathematics to convert human language into structured data that computers can process, involving steps like tokenization, syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Its ultimate objective is to empower computers with the capability to understand, analyze, and generate natural language, enabling them to perform complex tasks like interactive dialogue systems, automated content generation, and real-time language translation. This facilitates tasks such as automatic translation, text categorization, and sentiment analysis, among others, with applications in various industries such as finance for risk analysis, healthcare for patient record interpretation, and marketing for customer sentiment evaluation, as well as in legal for contract analysis and in education for personalized learning. The complexity of NLP is evident in its numerous steps, including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, stemming, and syntactic analysis, each requiring specific algorithms and techniques like Markov models, dependency parsers, and neural embeddings to process language accurately. Named entity recognition and other advanced NLP tasks pose additional challenges in replicating human language understanding in AI systems, particularly in handling context and ambiguity, such as differentiating between homonyms and resolving anaphora. Traditional natural language processing tasks typically use statistical algorithms like hidden Markov models and support vector machines, as noted by Hogenboom et al. in 2010, Serra et al. in 2013, and Aussenac-Gilles and S\u00f6rgel in 2005, for tasks like speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and part-of-speech tagging, which require precise modeling of language patterns. They also employ deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks for image-based input (Yin et al., 2017), recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction (Banerjee et al., 2019), and long short-term memory networks for handling sequential data (Yao and Guan, 2018), which excel in capturing temporal dependencies and contextual relationships, enhancing performance in tasks like video captioning and language modeling. Recently, the transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, has become a leading model in NLP, significantly increasing in popularity due to its ability to handle sequential data without the constraints of recurrent networks, allowing for more parallelization and efficiency, especially in tasks like large-scale translation and comprehensive text summarization. The transformer architecture, highlighted by Lewis et al. in 2019 and Raffel et al. in 2020, consistently demonstrates enhanced performance in NLP tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering, attracting many researchers due to its superior capability in modeling long-range dependencies and context, outperforming traditional models in accuracy and speed. The most prevalent language models today are the GPT families (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023) and BERT families (Liu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Sanh et al., 2019), excelling in a multitude of NLP tasks including question answering, text completion, and sentiment analysis, due to their sophisticated pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that enhance context understanding, language fluency, and adaptability across different domains. Among these, the AutoEncoder language model excels at natural language understanding tasks like classification and sentiment analysis, using techniques such as attention mechanisms and contrastive learning, while the AutoRegressive language model is better suited to natural language generation tasks such as storytelling and creative writing, leveraging sequence prediction and self-supervised learning for optimal performance. Increasing parameters, as shown by Touvron et al. (2023b), and tuning models, as demonstrated by Han et al. (2023), can enhance the performance of large language models by improving their generalization abilities, allowing them to better adapt to a wide range of tasks and handle diverse data, thereby boosting accuracy in complex problem-solving scenarios. However, the issue of 'hallucination,' where models generate inaccurate information, remains, as noted by Ji et al. (2023), posing a challenge in ensuring reliability and trustworthiness in AI outputs, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare diagnostics and financial forecasting, where precision is critical. Furthermore, the limitations of language models in handling knowledge-intensive tasks, as discussed by Feng et al. (2023), and their inability to update knowledge promptly, highlighted by Mousavi et al. (2024), are evident, especially in dynamic contexts where real-time information is crucial, such as in breaking news analysis and emergency response planning. Consequently, many researchers, including Lewis et al. (2020), Izacard and Grave (2020b), and Khandelwal et al. (2019), have used retrieval techniques like memory networks, external databases, and knowledge graphs to obtain external knowledge, enhancing language model performance across various tasks by supplementing them with up-to-date information and context, thereby improving accuracy and relevance. Currently, few surveys comprehensively cover the use of retrieval augmentation to improve large language models, often focusing on specific aspects such as retrieval methods or integration techniques rather than providing a holistic view, which limits understanding of its full potential in diverse applications like personalized education and adaptive learning. Zhao et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive overview of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multimodality, detailing its applications in cross-modal retrieval and synthesis, highlighting its versatility in integrating diverse data types, such as text, image, and audio, and enhancing multimodal AI systems for tasks like content creation and interactive storytelling. Zhao et al. (2024a) focus on using retrieval augmentation generation techniques in the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) domain, exploring methods that enhance creativity and coherence, such as context-aware retrieval and adaptive content blend, thereby broadening the scope of AI-generated outputs in creative industries like advertising and media. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent RAG work but excludes certain domains that are particularly relevant, such as real-time data integration, which could significantly advance dynamic application areas like stock market analysis and crisis management systems. Moreover, existing surveys on RAG offer only partial insights into retrieval-augmented methods in NLP, often omitting practical implementation strategies, which are crucial for translating theory into practice and facilitating real-world application, particularly in developing user-friendly interfaces and efficient data handling frameworks. The two components of RALM, the Retriever and the Language Model, are described in detail, and their interaction modes are precisely defined for the first time, providing a basis for developing more efficient systems by optimizing their synergy through better data retrieval and processing, thus enabling faster response times and improved accuracy in complex queries. A comprehensive overview of the RALM work schedule is provided, summarizing current applications like real-time translation, multilingual communication, and personalized content delivery, and analyzing their limitations, such as processing speed and data accessibility, which affect their effectiveness in timely communication and data handling, particularly in high-stakes environments. Potential solutions to these limitations are presented, along with specific recommendations for future research, including the exploration of hybrid models and adaptive learning techniques, aimed at overcoming current challenges and expanding the capabilities of language models by integrating more robust learning strategies, such as continuous learning and real-time data adaptation."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 30.905780792236328, "some": 0.892483631769816, "bart": -1.016398549079895, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a pivotal area within computer science and artificial intelligence, focusing on developing frameworks that enable seamless communication between humans and computers using natural language.

(2023) offer an overview of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multimodal applications, while Zhao et al. (2024a) focus on retrieval augmentation in AI-generated content (AIGC). Although these articles provide insights into recent RAG developments, they do not cover all relevant domains and lack a detailed timeline of the overall progress.\n\nGao et al. (2023) explore how to enhance RAG for large models, but their work introduces retrievers and generators separately, which is not conducive to improving component interactions in future research. Li et al. (2022b) concentrate solely on text generation, offering limited figures and tables that make the content less accessible to readers. Surveys on RAG only partially address retrieval-augmented methods in NLP, overlooking the importance of retrieval techniques in both natural language generation (NLG) and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Consequently, a comprehensive survey of retrieval-augmented techniques across the NLP spectrum is needed.\n\nTo address this gap, this paper makes the following contributions: (1) It goes beyond RAG by also focusing on retrieval-augmented language models (RALM), aligning with both NLG and NLU. (2) The paper provides a detailed description of RALM's two core components, the Retriever and the Language Model, and defines their interaction modes for the first time.

However, while these models perform exceptionally well for English, their effectiveness often diminishes in other languages due to a scarcity of training data and the complexities of linguistic diversity. A common approach to enhance multilingual capabilities is to pre-train and fine-tune the English model for other languages, leveraging robust techniques (Conneau and Lample, 2019). This approach utilizes the benefits of extensive English pre-training and aims to merge the language spaces of English and other languages, thus optimizing computational and data resources (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). A significant challenge in adapting large language models lies in the limited vocabulary coverage of the original model\u2019s tokenizer for the new language, which can hinder accurate representation and efficient tokenization. One effective method is to incorporate additional vocabulary into the tokenizer and then conduct pre-training on monolingual data from the new language to adapt the model (Cui et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023; Minixhofer et al., 2022). In this context, a critical issue concerns the initialization of embeddings for new vocabulary items. Our findings show that designing new vocabulary embeddings within the convex hull of the original embeddings ensures the model's existing language generation capabilities remain intact despite the introduction of new vocabulary. Based on these insights, we propose a straightforward learnable initialization technique, Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which maintains embeddings within the convex hull without depending on cross-lingual embeddings. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of CW2V alongside five current initialization strategies, including OFA, on two distinct models, RoBERTa (125M) and LLaMa2 (7B), assessing their performance across five downstream tasks in four languages. Through this analysis, we discover that CW2V consistently surpasses or meets the performance of the best existing methods. Furthermore, our study indicates that simpler methods, such as multivariate or mean initialization, which keep new embeddings within the convex hull, are on par with more sophisticated methods like OFA.

Despite their success in English, these models often exhibit reduced performance in other languages. A prevalent strategy to enhance their multilingual capabilities involves continually pre-training and fine-tuning the English model for additional languages (Conneau and Lample, 2019). This method leverages the capabilities gained from large-scale English pre-training and aims to align English and other language spaces, optimizing the use of computational and data resources (Cahyawijaya et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nA significant challenge in adapting large language models (LLMs) is the limited vocabulary coverage of the original model\u2019s tokenizer for new languages. This limitation can lead to an inability to represent new languages with entirely different vocabularies or to inefficient tokenization with high fertility when the vocabulary is inadequately represented. A solution is to expand the tokenizer to integrate new vocabulary and then perform continual pre-training on monolingual data of the new language, thereby adapting the model (Cui et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023; Minixhofer et al., 2022). An essential question arises: How should the embeddings of the new vocabulary items be initialized? Various methods have been explored, ranging from simple random initialization (Antoun et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020) to the mean of embeddings (Gee et al., 2022) and advanced techniques like OFA (Minixhofer et al., 2022; Dobler and de Melo, 2023; Tran, 2020; Liu et al., 2024), which learn new embeddings as a function of existing ones using external resources like cross-lingual word vectors and bilingual dictionaries. Despite these advancements, there is no theoretical consensus on what constitutes optimal initialization, and existing studies lack comparisons with straightforward initialization methods across various model sizes.\n\nIn this paper, we theoretically define and analyze the properties of effective initialization. We demonstrate that initializing new vocabulary embeddings within the convex hull of original embeddings ensures that the greedy generation of existing languages remains unaffected by new vocabulary items. Based on these insights, we introduce a straightforward, learnable initialization approach called Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which guarantees initializations within the convex hull without requiring cross-lingual embeddings. We conducted a comparative analysis of CW2V against five existing initialization strategies, including OFA, on two models with different parameter counts\u2014RoBERTa (125M) and LLaMa2 (7B)\u2014evaluating their performance across five downstream tasks in four languages.

The day came for us to take my dog to the vet. The vet, believing it was a minor issue, quickly examined her and concluded she was fine, having just hurt her back while jumping. At that point, I wasn't too worried and trusted his judgment. Another week passed, and the limp worsened. We returned to the vet, who this time performed an X-ray. Days later, the X-ray results came back, showing a slight disc slip in her back that had been there for a while but shouldn't have been causing the limp. He prescribed medication for inflammation and sent us home. A few days passed, and none of the prescribed treatments were effective, leaving us without answers. Finally, we decided to take her to a specialist vet who conducted various blood tests and thorough scans. My family and I went to the specialist's office that day, prepared to pay for any surgery needed to help with her limp. After hours of waiting, we finally got our answer: our dog had cancer. We were devastated; our world fell apart when we learned she had cancer of the spleen. Briefly, we were hopeful upon hearing that surgery was possible for $10,000, which we were willing to pay, but only if the cancer hadn't spread to her lymph nodes. After further testing, the vets discovered that the cancer had spread throughout her body and to her lymph nodes. That night and the next day, we said our goodbyes, as by then she could no longer walk. That was the worst day of my life; I still cry every day thinking about her.

We assumed it was just a minor injury. \n\nA week later, the limp noticeably worsened, and my mom and I grew concerned. We promptly called and scheduled a vet appointment for the following week. When the day finally arrived, we took her to the vet, thinking it was a minor issue. The vet gave her a quick examination and suggested she had likely hurt her back while jumping, assuring us that she was fine. At that point, I wasn\u2019t too concerned, trusting that he knew what he was talking about.\n\nAnother week passed, and the limp continued to worsen. We returned to the vet, who this time performed an X-ray. Days later, the results came in, and he diagnosed a slight disc slip in her back, which he believed shouldn\u2019t be causing the limp. He prescribed medication for inflammation and sent us on our way. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to help, and we were left without the answers we desperately sought.\n\nFinally, we decided to visit a specialist vet who could conduct thorough blood tests and scans. We entered the specialist\u2019s office that day, prepared to pay for whatever surgery might be needed to help our dog. After hours of waiting for the blood and scan results, we finally received our answer: our dog had cancer. We were crushed; our lives shattered upon hearing she had spleen cancer. For a brief moment, we felt hopeful when we learned that surgery was an option, albeit for $10,000\u2014a cost we were wholeheartedly willing to cover\u2014but only if the cancer hadn\u2019t spread to her lymph nodes. Further tests, however, revealed that it had spread throughout her body and lymph nodes.\n\nThat night and the following day, we said our goodbyes, as she was no longer able to walk. It was the worst day of my life, and I still cry every day thinking about her. My life was forever changed that day, and now my attention is constantly on my two remaining dogs, who lost their best friend. We buried her in our yard, marking her resting place with a beautiful cross bearing her name. She will never be forgotten."}}

Discuss the bird\u2019s specific qualities, such as its vibrant colors, melodious singing, and friendly nature. Mention that you believe this bird would be a delightful addition to the family because of its ability to bond with everyone and the companionship it can offer. For instance, tell your parents that you want a pet cockatiel because it is known for its intelligence, friendliness, relative quietness compared to other birds, and suitability for family environments. To ensure a comprehensive presentation, write down all the points you will discuss with your parents and emphasize the importance of organization. If you wish, provide your parents with a well-organized booklet containing your key points and research to help them understand your proposal better.

This method is most effective when applied before tears start to flow. Research indicates that smiling can improve emotional health. It also positively affects how others perceive you. Moreover, smiling can help counteract the symptoms of crying, making it easier to prevent tears. Splashing cold water on your face is a simple technique to alleviate intense, unpleasant emotions, as it can quickly refresh you and boost your alertness.

Find something that makes you laugh to give yourself some much-needed relief. Crying often results from prolonged tension and helps your body relax tense muscles and calm your mind. Moreover, it is a cognitive process that helps you differentiate between feeling tense and upset and feeling relaxed and calm. Start by tensing the muscle groups in your body one at a time, beginning at your toes and moving upward to your head, holding each for 30 seconds. This exercise can also help alleviate insomnia and restlessness. Research suggests that feelings of helplessness and passivity are often underlying causes of crying episodes. To avoid crying, shift your body from a passive to an active state. This can be as simple as getting up to walk around the room or gently squeezing your hands open and closed to engage your muscles and remind your body that your actions are voluntary and you are in control. If you notice any bruising or physical harm, it's advisable to stop using this method and try other techniques.

You can't address the problem unless you understand its root cause. The most common reasons for a student to drop out are either that they have missed too many days already in the school year or that they feel hopeless because they are beyond the point of overcoming a failing grade. Both of these situations can be addressed, but the student may not understand these problems. Other reasons students consider dropping out may include being bullied, a teen pregnancy, depression, drug or alcohol issues, or social problems at school. When you probe to get information about why they are considering dropping out, you have to be prepared for whatever the root cause of their decision may be. Rather than reacting with anger, offer your support. Ask how you can assist. Being supportive does not mean endorsing their behavior. If dropping out seems like a good idea to them because they simply do not like responsibility, your student needs to know that if he/she drops out, you will expect rent and financial contributions to the household via a job. Some students consider dropping out to enjoy their freedom by staying home. This should not be an option; if they drop out, they will be expected to work like other adults do. Dropping out is a significant decision that requires mature consideration. Having a trusted adult they can talk to in order to solve the problem will provide a significant advantage in terms of hope and future prospects. Community resources are available for teen parents and teenagers needing drug or alcohol treatment, such as mental health counseling. If their issue is tied to a physical or psychological problem, arranging a medical consultation with their doctor is the first step in getting help. Schools often have resource centers as well, so checking in with a guidance counselor, with the student's consent, can also help. The school can also inform you about alternative learning options if needed. For cases where the problem is actually with something or someone at school, a visit to the school is a first step. You may be able to solve a social problem, including bullying, by contacting the principal. A problem with a teacher can be resolved with a schedule change, and tutoring can also help improve a failing grade. In an extreme case, you may even consider alternative educational options, including homeschooling or online classes. Exploring all the academic options will enable you to identify the most suitable option for your student to finish school. Children who have good relationships with their parents tend to come to them with problems and seek their guidance. Children with parents who are actively involved in school and show that they value education are less likely to contemplate dropping out. Model life-long learning and encourage personal growth beyond the basic requirements. Encourage your student to explore hobbies or volunteer with groups that interest them in order to explore potential career options. Doing these activities together is a great way to find a common interest and inspire your student to consider their future prospects. Setting a future goal of attending college reduces the risk of dropping out. A student who feels they have talents beyond school may be less likely to be overwhelmed by an occasional failing grade and may not view dropping out as the only solution. Sometimes, parents are so busy telling kids what to do that they miss small messages that indicate a need for support. Pay attention to your kids and engage in active listening when they communicate with you. While hearing your child wants to drop out may seem like it came out of nowhere, it often results from multiple underlying factors. There are often signs, and being involved in all stages of their education can offer valuable insights into potential problems."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 28.894886016845703, "some": 0.8969117005666097, "bart": -1.3850699663162231, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Taking the time to listen without judgment to understand the root cause of a student's decision to drop out is crucial.

If a student thinks dropping out is a good idea simply because they dislike responsibility, they need to understand that if they drop out, they will be expected to contribute financially to the household by getting a job. Some students might consider dropping out just to enjoy their \"freedom\" by staying home. This should not be an option; if they drop out, they need to get a job like other adults.\n\nDropping out of school is an adult decision. Having a trusted adult to talk to can provide them with hope and a vision for the future. Community resources are available for teen parents, teenagers needing substance abuse treatment, or mental health counseling. If their issue is related to a physical or psychological problem, scheduling a checkup with a doctor is the first step towards getting help. Schools often have resource centers, so checking in with a guidance counselor, with the student's permission, can also be beneficial. The school can inform you about alternative learning options if needed. If the problem is related to something or someone at school, visiting the school is a good first step. You might be able to resolve social issues, such as bullying, by contacting the principal. A problem with a teacher could be addressed with a schedule change, while tutoring might help with a failing grade. In extreme cases, you might even consider homeschooling, starting college classes early, or completing school online. Exploring all academic options will help you find the best fit for your student to finish their education.\n\nChildren who have strong relationships with their parents are more likely to come to them with problems and heed their advice. Children with parents who are actively involved in their education and value learning are less likely to drop out. Model lifelong learning and encourage personal growth beyond the basics taught in school. Encourage your student to explore hobbies or volunteer with groups that interest them, which can help them consider potential careers. Engaging in these activities together is a great way to find common interests and get your student thinking about their future. A future goal of college makes dropping out a less appealing option. Setting aside time for non-school activities together strengthens your connection and creates new memories. A student who recognizes their talents beyond school may be less likely to feel overwhelmed by an occasional failing grade and less inclined to view dropping out as the only solution.\n\nSometimes, parents are so busy instructing their children that they miss subtle signals of distress. Pay attention to your kids, and when they talk, engage and listen. While it might seem that a child's decision to drop out came out of nowhere, it is often the culmination of a long process. There are usually signs, and being involved in all stages of their education can provide valuable insight into any changes."}}

Try to stretch at least once a day to get your body ready for exercise. Stretching does not improve muscle strength or heart efficiency. However, it does improve your flexibility, allows you to do different types of exercises more easily, improves your balance, and relieves muscle tension. Walk for approximately 5 minutes at this pace, and add about one or two minutes to your daily walk each day until you are walking 30 minutes every day. You can start doing things like walking on a flat surface for a few minutes at a time. Activities like cooking, washing dishes, shopping, light gardening, and light housework are also possible. However, it's unlikely that your physician would recommend you start a strength training program directly out of the hospital. Strength training will reduce the potential that you\u2019ll suffer from more inactivity. It also helps prevent muscle wasting. Do not hold your breath while you are lifting weights or moving against the resistance bands. This increases the pressure in your chest. It places a greater workload on your heart.

Aim to stretch at least once a day to prepare your body for exercise. Remember to relax and breathe through each stretch. Keep your joints slightly bent, never locked, to prevent injuries, and avoid bouncing your muscles. Instead, stretch smoothly and hold each position for 10 to 30 seconds, repeating three to four times. While stretching does not enhance muscle strength or cardiovascular efficiency, it improves flexibility, balance, and helps relieve muscle tension.\n\nWhether you were a marathon runner or a couch potato before your heart attack, your post-heart attack exercise regimen should start with a walking program. Begin with a three-minute warm-up walk, then increase your pace to where you're breathing heavier than at rest but can still maintain a conversation. Walk for about five minutes at this pace, adding one to two minutes each day until you reach 30 minutes daily. Walk with a partner initially, staying close to home in case you become uncomfortable or short of breath. Carry a cell phone for emergencies.\n\nCooling down after your workout is essential. Avoid strenuous activities for four to six weeks following your heart attack, as it typically takes this long for your heart to heal sufficiently for moderate to intense exercise, even if you were in good condition beforehand. Avoid heavy lifting, pulling, vacuuming, scrubbing, sweeping, painting, running, mowing, or any sudden bursts of movement. Instead, start with activities like walking on flat surfaces for short periods, cooking, washing dishes, shopping, light gardening, and light housework. Gradually increase your exercise duration and intensity, avoiding anaerobic exercise.\n\nExpect some muscle soreness in your legs and arms in the hours and days after starting a program, but they shouldn't feel painful during exercise. Just as if you were beginning a new exercise program before a heart attack, gradually increase your time and intensity to reduce injury risk and maintain motivation. Do not increase time or intensity without your physician's clearance beyond walking for 30 minutes. It may take up to 12 weeks to comfortably walk briskly for 30 minutes, depending on the extent of heart damage and your previous fitness level. Once comfortable, you can incorporate other exercises such as biking, hiking, rowing, jogging, or tennis. It's unlikely that your physician will recommend strength training immediately after hospitalization. Consult your physician about starting a strength training program.\n\nAt home, you can use hand weights or resistance bands, which are suitable for both arms and legs and allow you to gradually increase resistance and exertion. Allow muscles to recover between sessions; do not strength train more than three times a week, and wait at least 48 hours between sessions. Strength training can help you return to activities like mowing the lawn, playing with grandchildren, or carrying groceries, and reduce the risk of inactivity and muscle wasting. Do not hold your breath while lifting weights or using resistance bands, as this increases chest pressure and heart workload.\n\nAfter exercising, avoid sitting for prolonged periods. Research shows that even if you exercise for up to an hour a day, remaining sedentary for the rest of the day negates the benefits. Break up your day by stretching or moving every 30 minutes. Get up to drink water, use the bathroom, stretch, or walk around for five minutes. To encourage movement, consider walking while on the phone or standing instead of sitting, placing your water across the room to prompt frequent movement, and organizing your space to encourage getting up and down throughout the day."}}

The company will give you, for example, a week\u2019s notice before your car will be ready to ship, allowing you to prepare for the shipment. If the shipping dates aren\u2019t flexible and the car must be picked up on a certain day, you can contact the company and schedule a pickup by providing necessary details such as your preferred date and time. If you request a specific scheduled pickup, the shipping company will charge you an additional fee. This is a mandatory first step, even if the car will be shipped on an open trailer, to ensure proper documentation and preparation. You want to be able to note any chips, dings, nicks, or other cosmetic damage accurately to have a clear record before shipping. If you ship your car without washing it first, it'll be difficult to tell if a nick or dent is new or existed before the car was shipped. You can wash your car by hand using a bucket, water, soap, and a few clean rags, ensuring all areas are thoroughly cleaned. The shippers will take precautions to keep your car safe, so you won't need to have the car alarm turned on. Before the shippers pick up your car, either fully shut off the car alarm or temporarily disable it so that you can easily turn it back on when you pick the car up. Refer to your car manual to find out how to disable the alarm properly. You may need to navigate an electronic menu system particular to your car. While the shippers will still be able to transport the vehicle if the car alarm is on, it will be an unpleasant and loud experience for them. Since you\u2019re not driving the car to its destination, there's no need to have the car shipped with a full tank of gas. Shipping companies often prefer to ship cars with the gas tank close to empty because a full tank is heavy and may overload the shipping truck. If the gas tank is low, between 1/8th to 1/4th of a tank, it will save a significant amount of weight. Secure or remove any loose parts or specialty items from your car, such as ground effects, spoilers, or fog lights, to prevent damage during transport. These could become damaged or break off while the car ships, and the shipper's insurance may not cover this type of item. If you have wide side mirrors, fold them back. Be sure to lower and remove or retract the antennae. Also, remove any personal items from your car. The shipping company will most likely not insure personal items left behind, so ensure they are removed before shipment. You may want to go as far as taking and dating pictures of the vehicle prior to shipping it. Then, compare these photographs with more photos you'll take after the vehicle arrives at its destination. These photos will show if the car was damaged while being shipped and will serve as valuable evidence to show the insurance company if you file for damages. Most shipping companies will provide you with a location that you\u2019ll bring your car to on the day it ships. The company will also specify a time at which you should bring your car by the pickup location. Bring your car to the location about 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Or, if your shipping company is picking up your car, have it in the street, ready to go by the pickup time. When dropping off your car, be sure to leave your car keys with the driver. Otherwise, they\u2019ll be unable to start your car and move it onto the truck. You will need three documents to verify your identity and prove that the car is registered in your name. If the registration and proof of insurance are not already in your glove box, make sure to put them somewhere in the car before you drop it off for shipment. The driver or a business representative from the shipping company may need to write down your ID number and your insurance policy number. Before the shipping company can transport your vehicle, they\u2019ll need you to fill out and sign some paperwork. If you\u2019re shipping your vehicle internationally, you may need to sign forms dealing with import laws in the country the car is going to. The company may ask you to review and sign documents including a shipping invoice. A certificate of origin certifying the country from which the shipped items are coming will be required. Forms listing payments received and any outstanding financial balance will also be included. The shipping company will appreciate your thorough descriptions of any difficulties that they may have when trying to start, stop, or drive your vehicle on and off of the trailer.

However, the scale of LLMs presents unique challenges to explainability. Larger models, with their vast number of parameters and extensive training data, are more difficult to interpret. Traditional explanation methods like SHAP values (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) become less feasible for these large-scale models (Zhao et al., 2023).\n\nFurthermore, achieving a comprehensive understanding of LLM-specific phenomena, including in-context learning (Halawi et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023; Todd et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), and addressing issues such as model hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023) and inherent biases (dev, 2023; An and Rudinger, 2023; Schick et al., 2021), is crucial for ongoing model design refinement.

Additionally, take large steps, almost as if you're taking two steps at a time, to activate a larger portion of these muscles.\n\nAnother effective cardio machine for toning your buttocks and hips, and potentially increasing hip size, is the elliptical. This machine allows you to thoroughly engage those muscles, recruiting about 36% of your glute and hip muscles\u2014slightly more than the stair master. Use the elliptical for at least 30 minutes. For a well-rounded workout, consider doing 15 minutes on the stair master followed by 15 minutes on the elliptical. To specifically target your hip and butt muscles, focus on pressing down with your foot heel first, and slightly ease your hips backward, which helps target those muscles.\n\nRunning is another excellent cardio exercise for targeting your buttocks and hips. Using a treadmill, in particular, allows you to utilize the incline function, making it an effective way to increase hip size. Walking or jogging on the treadmill engages the highest amount of your hip and butt muscles\u2014up to 50%. Walk or jog on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes. For a more comprehensive workout, combine multiple cardio exercises to engage your buttocks and hips in different ways, providing a better overall workout. To specifically target your hips, increase the treadmill incline, which places more stress on your glutes and hips, enhancing your lower body's definition. Another technique is to walk sideways on the treadmill. Set it on an incline and start at a slow pace, crossing your legs over one another to walk sideways. This movement provides the tension needed for muscle growth in your hips.\n\nIf you're looking to burn calories while toning your hips, consider taking a spin class. It's an excellent exercise for strengthening and toning your hips, buttocks, and thighs. Spin classes engage many of the muscles around your hips and buttocks. The up-and-down motion and varying resistance levels make it a great exercise for increasing hip size. To specifically target your hips, sit farther back on the bike seat and focus on pushing down hard on the pedals. You might also want to increase the resistance. When standing on the bike, push your butt out behind you, stabilizing your body with your butt and hip muscles.\n\nYour exercise plan should include at least one rest day per week to prevent plateaus and allow your body time to recover. Mix up your workouts and their intensity to keep yourself motivated and engaged."}}

This task is relevant to areas such as intention classification, topic classification, and sentiment analysis (Jang et al., 2019; Kim and Jeong, 2019; Risch and Krestel, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Heo et al., 2021). Since the emergence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in text classification (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020; Shaheen et al., 2020). However, these models may experience underfitting when the model size is disproportionately large compared to the training data (Liu et al., 2019). To address this issue, some studies suggest enhancing performance by artificially increasing the dataset size (Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In data-driven machine learning, collecting a substantial amount of high-quality data is vital for effective model training. However, since data collection processes are not always feasible, many studies address this challenge through data augmentation using existing data (Yu et al., 2018; Wei and Zou, 2019; Feng et al., 2019; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020).\n\nTwo main strategies are employed for natural language data augmentation: collecting data through human effort and creating or modifying data mechanically or semi-automatically. While the former ensures data quality, it is time-consuming and costly to manually collect and preprocess large datasets. Consequently, various automation strategies have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Notable approaches include augmenting data using generation models or modifying parts of the text (Yu et al., 2018; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019; Xie et al., 2020). For instance, Yu et al. (2018) introduced a back-translation method using bidirectional machine translation systems, where English sentences are translated to French and then back to English. However, this method can lead to semantic discrepancies, resulting in less natural and syntactically plausible sentences.\n\nIn text modification approaches, data similar to the original text is generated using strategies such as synonym replacement, random word insertion, swapping the positions of random words, or deleting random words (Wei and Zou, 2019). Other studies explore the effects of introducing synthetic noise, replacing words with hyponyms and hypernyms, and employing semantic text exchange (Feng et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). However, utilizing resources like WordNet or part-of-speech taggers often demands significant time and budget.\n\nTo address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme using a paraphrase-based generation model and a character order change (COC) strategy. Our methodology consists of three steps (Figure 1): the first involves augmenting data using a generation model on raw text, termed data augmentation with generation (DAG). The second step involves using COC to corrupt certain words in the raw text, referred to as data augmentation with modification (DAM). Finally, we combine these two methods into a unified approach called data augmentation with generation and modification (DAGAM).\n\nOur methodology offers a straightforward and efficient strategy for automatically augmenting natural language data. We applied this data augmentation technique to six benchmark datasets in the text classification task. To evaluate its effectiveness, we used BERT, a representative Transformer-based pre-trained language model, for fine-tuning and assessment. The utility of our methodology is confirmed by performance improvements across all benchmark datasets compared to cases with no augmentation. Our work contributes to the field as follows:\n\n- We introduce DAG, a data augmentation method utilizing a generation model; DAM, a method employing character order changing (COC); and DAGAM, a combined approach of the two methods. We validate and compare their utility through BERT-based fine-tuning and evaluation.\n- Our methodologies provide the industry and academic communities with accessible data augmentation strategies."}}

Ask your cleaner any questions you may have and make sure to point out problem spots. If your clothing item is crushed or polyester velvet, you can either throw it in the washing machine or wash it by hand in a sink or tub; washing the article yourself can save money on dry cleaning and may be just as effective as a professional, so make sure to read the label before you start. If you have any misgivings about washing the item yourself, err on the side of caution and dry clean it at home or through a professional. Avoid washing the item with hot water, which can shrink it and cause it to lose elasticity. Consider using a detergent for delicate fabrics or specifically for velvet, and set a washing machine to either the \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201chand wash\u201d cycle to ensure that the machine doesn\u2019t damage your clothing. Hand wash your velvet by filling a tub with lukewarm or cold water and a small amount of detergent, swishing your piece of velvet clothing through the sudsy water by using gentle movements of your hand until the item is clean. Avoid scrubbing or twisting the item, which can stretch or damage the fabric. When you\u2019re done washing the item, empty the tub and refill it with cool water, pushing the garment up and down until you don\u2019t see any more soap or residue. Instead of washing the entire garment, consider spot cleaning to protect your velvet and save money. Mix one teaspoon delicate care laundry detergent with 2 cups cold water in a tub or sink, dipping a clean, soft white cloth into the mixture and wringing it out well. Dab\u2014don\u2019t rub\u2014any stains with the white cloth until all of the stains are gone, making sure to remoisten the cloth as needed. Once the stain is gone, rinse the white cloth with cold water and wring it out, then dab the spot to remove soap and any lingering residue. Mix a paste of lemon juice and baking soda, dilute it with water, and gently dab the solution on the spot until it is gone. Be aware that this is a very potent combination that can damage your garment if you do not dilute the mixture or apply it lightly. Consider using a dry cleaning solvent to spot clean stains; however, be aware that they often contain harsh chemicals that can quickly damage your velvet article if not used properly. To freshen your velvet garment, use a hand-held steamer, which can remove wrinkles and make the fabric appear clean and lush again. After steaming, spritz with fabric freshening spray to make it smell nice, holding the steamer about 6 inches from the garment to prevent soaking it. Run the steamer from the outside hems toward the middle of the garment, and consider turning the garment inside out when steaming and spritzing it with fabric freshener. This can have the same effect as directly steaming and spritzing the garment. Try hanging the item in a steamy bathroom if you do not have a hand-held steamer; putting a velvet garment inside of a steamy, hot shower without exposing it directly to the water stream is as effective as a steamer. No matter what, do not put your velvet clothing into a dryer; this can shrink the garment and ruin the fabric\u2019s luxurious texture. Hang any item you\u2019ve machine washed and allow it to dry thoroughly; if necessary, use a steamer to remove any wrinkles. Push out any excess water from a hand-washed garment with gentle pressure, making sure that you do not twist or wring the item. Then lay out the garment on a flat surface, placing a clean, white towel under the item to prevent discoloration and allow it to dry thoroughly. If the white towel becomes saturated, replace it with a new, dry white towel, and consider allowing your garment to sit on top of a dryer. The gentle heat will speed up the drying process while protecting your velvet garment from damage."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 42.17605209350586, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -1.9805824756622314, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Before washing velvet clothing, always check the care label.

Once the stain is removed, rinse the cloth with cold water and dab the area to eliminate soap residue. A diluted paste of lemon juice and baking soda can also be used, but apply it cautiously to avoid damage.\n\nFor freshening up velvet without a full wash, use a handheld steamer to remove wrinkles and restore the fabric's appearance. Keep the steamer about six inches from the garment and move from the hems to the center. If you don't have a steamer, hang the garment in a steamy bathroom. Never use a dryer, as it can shrink and ruin velvet's texture.\n\nAfter machine washing, hang the garment to dry completely. Use a steamer for any remaining wrinkles. For hand-washed items, gently press out excess water without wringing, then lay flat on a clean, white towel. Replace the towel if it becomes saturated. You can expedite drying by placing the garment on top of a dryer, as the gentle heat will aid the process while protecting the fabric."}}

Start setting your alarm to go off at least ten minutes earlier to ensure you have enough time for de-icing, which will help you avoid feeling rushed and ensure a smoother morning. Consider using household ingredients like vinegar or rubbing alcohol as a homemade substitute for de-icer only as a last resort, but be cautious with their use. For the best results, use a product specifically designed for de-icing to avoid damaging your car. Always stock up on professionally-made de-icer before winter, so you're prepared for icy conditions that can occur unexpectedly. De-icer can be found online and at auto parts stores.

Avoid chipping away at one tiny area to prevent scratching the glass, as this can lead to damage. Use the scraper's brush end or a separate brush to clear loose ice off the window, or a cloth if a brush is unavailable.

For example, a flowing, poofy skirt may require more inches at the hip than an A-line skirt. The stretchiness of the fabric also influences how many inches you add; particularly stretchy fabrics may require fewer additional inches. Most patterns will guide you on how many inches to add.

You can recover in a calming facility, which offers a structured environment and professional support, allowing you to escape from the pressures of day-to-day life and focus on healing without the distractions and triggers of your usual environment. Some people can detox well in a facility but face difficulties when returning home due to the lack of structured support and the challenges of managing triggers in their usual environment, such as stress from work or family dynamics. Having the support of family and friends can make this transition easier by providing emotional support, encouragement, and accountability during your recovery journey, helping to reinforce positive changes and offering practical help when needed. Inpatient detox can also be quite expensive, with costs varying depending on the facility, the duration of treatment, and the level of care provided, which may include amenities such as private rooms or specialized therapies.

You won\u2019t have to stay overnight at the facility, but your medications and recovery progress will be closely supervised by the professionals there, ensuring a safe and effective detox process through regular check-ins and adjustments as needed, with detailed oversight of your health. Outpatient detox offers the benefit of being able to live at home and maintain your freedom, as well as being less expensive than inpatient detox, but it requires strong commitment and support to avoid relapse, especially in the presence of everyday stressors and temptations. However, outpatient detox also makes it easier to relapse and start drinking again, especially if triggers and stressors are present in your home environment, such as social gatherings where alcohol is available or unresolved personal conflicts. This is particularly hard if you have a difficult home life or if another family member is an alcoholic, as these factors can increase the risk of relapse and make it challenging to maintain new habits and sobriety. Outpatient detox is only suitable for those with mild to moderate symptoms of alcoholism, who haven\u2019t been drinking heavily or for a long time, and have a stable home environment that supports their recovery efforts and minimizes exposure to drinking triggers.

If you are chemically dependent on alcohol, quitting or cutting back can be very challenging due to withdrawal symptoms, psychological dependence, and lifestyle changes, which may require comprehensive support and intervention, including therapies and medical assistance. Fortunately, medications are available that can ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings, making the process easier and more manageable, though they may come with side effects that need to be monitored by healthcare professionals. Talk to your doctor about trying one of these commonly prescribed medications: Disulfiram (Antabuse) discourages drinking by interacting with alcohol to produce unpleasant physical reactions like nausea and headaches, but it requires commitment and can have side effects such as liver issues and must be used with caution. Naltrexone (Revia) prevents you from feeling the pleasant \u201cbuzz\u201d that alcohol normally produces, reducing the desire to drink, but it may cause side effects such as nausea and fatigue, which should be discussed with your healthcare provider to ensure it\u2019s suitable for you. Acamprosate (Campral) reduces alcohol cravings by stabilizing brain chemistry, helping maintain abstinence, but it requires adherence to a dosing schedule and may cause side effects such as diarrhea or mood changes, necessitating regular follow-up with your doctor. If you experience severe whole-body tremors after you stop drinking, along with other symptoms such as hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, and seizures, seek medical attention immediately as these can be life-threatening and require prompt treatment to prevent complications.

These approaches are generative because they model the document generation process. Simple unigram mixture models often use information from both the background collection and a specific document. The main challenge is to accurately estimate parameters, and various smoothing techniques have been developed [12] to improve parameter estimation for document models within a collection. Consequently, in information retrieval, once document models are estimated, documents can be ranked by the likelihood that the model generates the query (i.e., the query-likelihood approach [10]). Recently, document language models with a self-reinforcing property via a multivariate P\u00f3lya process have significantly improved retrieval effectiveness [5]. This method effectively captures the burstiness of words unique to each document. In this paper, we build on this approach by describing a more general process for statistical document modeling, which includes several existing document language models and introduces new variants. In Section 2, we introduce a general model of document generation using an urn scheme that crucially captures the dynamics of document generation with a matrix M. In Section 3, we explore specific configurations of M that determine different generative distributions. Section 4 describes how the new general model is applied to document retrieval. Section 5 discusses the results of several experiments. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude with a discussion and outline future work. In the Generalized P\u00f3lya process, let u0 be an urn initially containing |u0| balls, each of a different color. Starting at time i = 0, a ball is drawn with replacement from the urn, and additional balls, potentially of various colors, are added according to a replacement matrix M. Each row of the matrix specifies how many additional balls of each color are added to the urn based on the color of the drawn ball. Thus, the matrix M defines the dynamic nature of this random process. Now, if d = {ti} is a sequence of observations indexed from i = 0 to i = |d|\u22121 drawn from the urn, the urn's state can be described as a recurring process as follows. The equation ui+1 = ui + eti \u00b7 M (1), where eti is a standard basis vector (also known as a one-hot vector), illustrates this process. At a specific time i, for an observation ti, the process selects row ti of matrix M and combines it with the ith state of the urn, ui. This process gives the urn a reinforcing property, which, in certain cases, leads to the traditional P\u00f3lya urn scheme. The generalized P\u00f3lya process is defined by both the replacement matrix M and the initial parameters u0, allowing the likelihood of observing a specific sample d to be expressed as p(d|u0, M). One can interpret u0 as defining the probability of drawing a particular colored ball on the first draw, and M as defining the urn's dynamics.

As a result, fine-tuning Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), for specific tasks has become essential in real-world applications (Alt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Moreover, improving the performance of PLM fine-tuning typically requires access to task-specific data (Zhou and Chen, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). However, obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is challenging due to the costly, complex, and labor-intensive nature of the annotation process (Yu et al., 2019; Bae et al., 2022). For example, datasets obtained through web crawling (Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) or crowdsourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2021) often contain noisy labels. To illustrate the challenge, Figure 1 by Zhen Tan and Jundong Li shows the average confidence of clean and noisy samples during BERT fine-tuning on the 20Ng and AGNews datasets with 20% noisy labels. In the 20Ng dataset (Lang, 1995), for instance, when a sample labeled as 'autos' is incorrectly tagged as 'hardware,' PLMs can memorize this error, complicating the distinction between clean and noisy samples and leading to incorrect pseudo-labeling. In summary, our contributions include pioneering the use of confidence scores from large language models (LLMs) to address the noisy label problem in fine-tuning PLMs. As shown in Figure 1, PLMs exhibit similar prediction confidences for both clean and noisy samples, leading to two challenges: (1) existing methods often rely on confidences from models trained on potentially noisy samples (Li et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2022)."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 35.72490692138672, "some": 0.8923385143280029, "bart": -0.7668638825416565, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "In recent years, the development of language models has significantly broadened the applications within the field of natural language processing (NLP). Fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) for specific downstream tasks has become a crucial step in real-world implementations (Alt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Generally, achieving substantial performance improvements in fine-tuning PLMs requires the availability of task-specific data (Zhou and Chen, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). However, acquiring high-quality labeled datasets for this purpose presents significant challenges due to the costly, complex, and labor-intensive nature of the annotation process (Yu et al., 2019; Bae et al., 2022). For instance, large-scale datasets, often sourced from web-crawling (Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019) or crowd-sourcing (Yan et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2021), frequently contain noisy labels.\n\nPrevious research (Arpit et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021c; Wang et al., 2023a) has demonstrated that PLMs tend to overfit and generally perform poorly when fine-tuned on datasets with label noise. Since fine-tuning involves leveraging supervision information to enhance performance on downstream tasks, the presence of noisy labels can mislead the training process and significantly impair the effectiveness of PLMs (Zhu et al., 2022). Therefore, there is an urgent need to design effective algorithms for fine-tuning PLMs in the presence of noisy labels.\n\nIn the context of learning from noisy labels, an intuitive approach is to separate clean samples from noisy ones within the training set for model training (Han et al., 2018). For the remaining noisy samples, a common strategy is to pseudo-label them based on model predictions to mitigate the adverse effects of noise (Berthelot et al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2020). However, applying this paradigm to PLMs remains challenging. This is because PLMs, equipped with prior knowledge encoded in a large number of parameters, tend to memorize noisy samples early in the fine-tuning process. As illustrated in Figure 1, PLMs exhibit similar prediction confidences for both clean and noisy samples, leading to two main challenges when utilizing existing methods: \n\n1. Existing approaches often rely on confidences generated by models trained on potentially noisy samples (Li et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2022). However, as shown in Figure 1, it is difficult to accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples based solely on confidences.\n2. Existing methods are prone to errors during pseudo-labeling, as they directly use model predictions as pseudo-labels, which can be detrimental when the predictions are inaccurate. PLMs, with their tendency to easily remember noisy samples, exacerbate the risk of capturing and amplifying erroneous information during pseudo-labeling. For example, in the 20Ng dataset (Lang, 1995), when a sample labeled as \"autos\" is mistakenly assigned the label \"hardware,\" PLMs can easily memorize this incorrect information, hindering their ability to infer correct labels in future predictions.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework named LAFT, which leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) for fine-tuning PLMs. We utilize LLMs trained on extensive corpora and fine-tuned with human instructions, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), to obtain external guidance in the form of confidence values. Our approach addresses the first challenge of distinguishing reliable samples by utilizing LLM-generated confidences for each class of all training samples. By comparing these confidences with the assigned labels (i.e., the given noisy labels) of training samples, we categorize them into three distinct subsets: the Easy Clean (EC) Set, the Hard Clean (HC) Set, and the True Noisy (TN) Set.\n\nRegarding the second challenge, we propose a novel method to incorporate LLM-generated confidence scores as robust supervision information for all samples, ensuring that PLMs learn valuable information from them. Since LLM-generated confidences are not affected by label noise, they can provide potentially relevant labels that are useful even if not entirely accurate.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n- We are the first to explore the potential of leveraging supervision information (i.e., confidence scores) generated by LLMs to tackle the noisy label problem in fine-tuning PLMs.\n- We propose a novel framework, LAFT, that effectively separates clean and noisy samples and learns from noisy labels based on LLM-generated confidences.\n- We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our framework in fine-tuning PLMs with noisy labels."}}

It's essential to spare your child any embarrassment associated with their habit. If they start sucking their fingers in public, establish a special hand signal or private cue to discreetly alert them to stop. You could also use a code word like \u201cbubbles\u201d to signal them.\n\nBreaking a habit is challenging for a child, so it's crucial to encourage them throughout the process. Remind them how good it will feel to be a \"big kid.\" Offer reassurance often, especially if they make a mistake. For example, you could say, \u201cI know this is really hard, Sara, but you\u2019re doing a great job not sucking your fingers.\u201d Engage in activities like a mirror game to motivate them. Stand with your child in front of a mirror, and have them observe their teeth.

That was awesome, and I am so proud of you!\u201d Offer verbal praise and other incentives, like stickers on a calendar leading to a reward or goal. You could also create a sign for your child that says, \u201cWay to go, Sam!\u201d decorated with stars and other designs.\n\nIf your child meets their goals or stops sucking their fingers, reward them!

Researchers define self-compassion as encompassing three key components: self-kindness, which involves treating yourself with understanding rather than harshness; common humanity, which is recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and experiences pain, fostering a sense of belonging; and mindfulness, which is about observing your experiences without judgment, akin to meditation. Self-kindness involves being gentle and accepting toward yourself instead of labeling yourself as selfish or narcissistic. When a friend makes a mistake, you strive to understand their error rather than constantly criticize them. Offer yourself the same kindness you would offer to a friend. Common humanity helps you realize that mistakes and pain are universal, enhancing your connection with others. Understanding you are not alone in your mistakes or pain strengthens this connection. Mindfulness is about observing and accepting your experiences without judgment, similar to meditation. For instance, instead of thinking, \"I'm unattractive, nobody will love me,\" mindfulness encourages you to acknowledge, \"I feel unattractive right now, but it's just one of many emotions today.\" We often misconstrue self-acceptance as indulgent or lazy behavior. However, perfectionism and self-criticism are often mistakenly viewed as productive, even though they usually stem from fear. Self-pity should not be mistaken for self-compassion. While self-pity involves feeling sorry for yourself, such as thinking, \"My colleague got more credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me,\" self-compassion involves acknowledging your feelings without overidentifying with them. A self-compassionate thought might be, \"My colleague and I both worked hard, and I did well. I can't control how others respond.\" Self-compassion isn't about laziness; it's about understanding that accepting yourself doesn't mean you stop seeking improvement or growth. It involves not being overly harsh on yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing self-love enables you to share love with others as well. Criticizing yourself is different from taking responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can recognize their mistakes without feeling like a terrible person. Research suggests that self-compassionate people are more inclined to pursue self-improvement. Although self-esteem and self-compassion may seem similar, they differ significantly in their impact on our well-being. Self-esteem involves your perception and feelings about yourself, which are important for a happy life but often rely on external validation, such as feeling attractive when someone compliments you. Self-compassion is about embracing yourself, including your flaws, with kindness and understanding. Psychological research indicates that self-esteem isn't a reliable measure of success or ability. Sometimes, those who appear the most confident may not be the most knowledgeable. Shame can manifest as feelings of being undeserving of love or fearing someone will leave if you reveal your true self. These common feelings can indeed be damaging. Remind yourself that you are deserving of love. Yet, you can take steps to improve self-acceptance. Focus on your strengths. We often pay more attention to failures than successes. Each day, write something positive about yourself. Initially, believing isn't necessary. Consistently thinking positively about yourself can help reduce resistance. Distinguish your identity from your failures. It's easy to think, \"I'm a failure,\" but this thought undermines you and fosters shame. Instead, consider thinking, \"I didn't succeed at _____, but I did my best.\" Remind yourself that being human means embracing imperfection. Perfectionism can severely affect your self-perception. Look in the mirror and affirm, \"I am a human being. Human beings aren't perfect, and that's okay.\" As a human being, you might sometimes do things you didn't intend to do. You might not perform well on a test, hurt a friend's feelings, or lose your temper with your boss. Dwelling on negatives and engaging in self-shaming prevents you from learning.

According to researchers, self-compassion comprises three key elements: \n\n1. **Self-kindness**: We often learn that being understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic. However, consider how you would treat a friend who made a mistake\u2014would you criticize them relentlessly, or would you show understanding? Offer yourself the same kindness you would extend to others.\n\n2. **Common Humanity**: It's easy to feel alone in our imperfections and guilt, but mistakes and pain are universal human experiences. Recognizing that you are not alone in making mistakes or feeling hurt can foster a sense of connection with others.\n\n3. **Mindfulness**: This involves acknowledging and accepting your experiences without judgment. For example, instead of thinking, \"I'm so unattractive, nobody will love me,\" a mindful approach would be, \"I'm experiencing the feeling of unattractiveness. This is just one of many feelings I will have today.\" Recognizing negative thoughts allows you to redirect them constructively.\n\nWe are often conditioned to view self-acceptance as self-indulgent or lazy, while perfectionism and self-criticism are seen as productive. In reality, these are often rooted in fear. Self-compassion, on the other hand, is not about self-pity, which focuses solely on personal problems and fosters inadequacy. A self-compassionate perspective might be, \"My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I did a good job. I can't control how others respond.\"\n\nSelf-compassion is not laziness; it doesn't mean you lack the desire to improve. It simply means treating yourself with kindness when mistakes occur. Practicing self-love also enhances your ability to love others. A self-compassionate person can acknowledge mistakes without feeling they are fundamentally flawed. Research shows that self-compassionate individuals are more inclined to pursue self-improvement.\n\nWhile self-compassion and self-esteem sound similar, they differ significantly. Self-esteem is about how you think and feel about yourself, often driven by external validation, such as compliments. Self-compassion involves accepting your flaws and treating yourself with kindness. Psychological research indicates that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or capability; sometimes, the most confident people know the least.\n\nShame, a pervasive source of pain, is the belief that we are unworthy of love, time, or attention. Often, shame is unrelated to actual faults but is an internal judgment. Being aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself is crucial. Shame can manifest as feeling undeserving of love or fearing rejection if you reveal your true self. These common feelings are damaging. Affirming your worthiness of love is vital, though it may not come naturally, as self-criticism is often seen as a motivator.\n\nTo improve self-acceptance, focus on your strengths. Humans tend to remember failures more vividly than successes. Take time each day to note something positive about yourself, even if you don't believe it at first. Regularly thinking positively about yourself can reduce resistance to accepting these traits.\n\nDepersonalize failures by avoiding totalizing thoughts like \"I'm a failure.\" Instead, consider, \"I didn't succeed at _____, but I did my best.\" Remind yourself that you're human, and perfection is unattainable. Look in the mirror and say, \"I am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.\"\n\nWhen you make a mistake, whether it's scoring poorly on a test, hurting a friend's feelings, or losing your temper, dwelling on these events and shaming yourself prevents you from learning. Accept what happened, apologize if possible, and plan for future improvements. Accepting mistakes doesn't mean ignoring them or not feeling bad; it means acknowledging them and focusing on learning and growth, transforming guilt into positive change."}}

Over time on Earth, the iron in the meteorite reacts with oxygen in the air, leading to oxidation and turning it a rusty brown. The rusting process begins with small red and orange spots on the surface that gradually expand to cover more of the meteorite. Even if some parts have started to rust, you might still see the original black crust on the meteorite. Meteorites may appear black with variations such as steely blue-black or even dark gray, showing a range of colors. If the rock you found isn't close to black or brown, it likely isn't a meteorite, as these colors are key for identification. Contrary to what you might think, most meteorites have irregular shapes rather than being spherical. While some meteorites may form a conical shape, most do not appear aerodynamic after they land. Despite being irregular, most meteorites have rounded edges rather than sharp ones. If the rock you found is relatively ordinary in shape or round like a ball, it might still be a meteorite, although most are characterized by their irregular shapes. As rocks enter Earth's atmosphere, their surfaces melt, and air pressure pushes the molten material backward, creating a smooth, featureless surface known as a fusion crust. If your rock's surface looks melted and shifted, it could be a meteorite. A fusion crust is typically smooth and featureless, but it may have ripple marks and \"droplets,\" where molten stone moved and solidified. If your rock lacks a fusion crust, it is unlikely to be a meteorite; this fusion crust may resemble a black eggshell coating the rock. Desert rocks can develop a shiny black exterior similar to a fusion crust; however, desert varnish forms differently over time. If you found your rock in a desert, consider whether the black surface might be desert varnish, which is distinct from a fusion crust. Flow lines are small streaks on the fusion crust formed when the meteorite was molten and pushed backward by air pressure.

Use a magnifying glass to carefully observe flow lines on a rock's surface. Although the surface of a meteorite is generally smooth, it may include shallow pits and deep cavities that resemble thumbprints. Look for these features to determine if your rock is a meteorite and what type it is.

If participants are unsure about how to navigate an obstacle, they may do so in an unfair or unsafe manner. Consider the various types of obstacles you can include and how you can effectively guide participants through them. Providing clear instructions can help minimize the risk of injury and ensure a fair experience for participants. Clearly outline the steps required to complete each obstacle. One common thread in obstacle courses is the inclusion of challenges that evaluate a participant's agility. To navigate these obstacles successfully, a person must exhibit quick and precise movements. A well-designed course should incorporate a variety of obstacles that challenge participants' agility. A classic agility test involves navigating a series of cones, mimicking the movements of a skier in a slalom course. Consider placing small threads with bells near the ground to create a challenging obstacle that participants must carefully avoid. Participants must carefully avoid the bells as they navigate around them. Hanging hula-hoops from a branch creates a challenging obstacle that requires participants to hop or step through them. Similarly, leap-over and leap-around obstacles are common in many obstacle courses. Adding jumping challenges can elevate your course to a fun and engaging experience. Here are some ideas to spark your creativity when designing jumping obstacles. Set up targets, such as hula hoops, on the ground to encourage participants to jump towards them. Consider incorporating a pogo-stick or bounce-ball section into your course. Design a high-jump obstacle by placing a soft barrier, such as a hay bale, in the path. Performing a series of frog jumps can effectively assess a participant's jumping abilities. Balancing obstacles challenge participants to make precise movements as they navigate the course. They typically require participants to exhibit slow, deliberate, and controlled movements. A simple, straight board can serve as an effective balance beam. Participants may be required to balance on one leg for a specified duration. Participants may be challenged to balance a ball on their head for a few seconds. Even in individual competitions, consider incorporating obstacles that foster teamwork and collaboration. Incorporating teamwork obstacles can help participants work together to overcome challenges and achieve a common goal. Partners may be required to complete a set number of ball tosses and catches. The three-legged race is a classic team-based obstacle that requires coordination and communication. A human wheelbarrow section can be an effective way to promote teamwork and collaboration among participants. In addition to evaluating agility, speed, and balance, obstacles should also challenge participants' strength and endurance. Strength-based obstacles often require participants to move or lift weights over a specified distance or number of repetitions. Consider adding a push-up section where participants must complete a set number of reps before progressing. A pull-up bar or arm hang bar can effectively evaluate upper body strength. Carrying heavy weights while running can be an effective way to assess full-body strength.

A high jump obstacle can be created by placing a soft item, like a hay bale, in the path. Frog jumps over a series of markers can also test jumping abilities.\n\nBalancing obstacles focus on testing participants' fine motor skills and require slower, more deliberate movements. A simple balance beam made from a straight board is effective. You could also challenge participants to stand on one leg for a set amount of time or balance a ball on their head for a few seconds.\n\nWhile many obstacle courses are competitive, incorporating teamwork challenges can foster collaboration among participants.

Do you play here often?\" Connect with others by responding with similar experiences or feelings to what they share. For instance, if they mention a tough commute, you could relate by sharing your own frustrations with driving or public transportation. Nervous mistakes are a natural part of dating, and everyone experiences them at some point. You might trip over your words or make an embarrassing typo on a dating app, but that's completely normal. Instead of dwelling on awkward moments, try to lighten the mood with a self-deprecating joke. Fortunately, many people find a bit of nervousness endearing during a date. Aim to connect with someone who shows genuine interest rather than settling for someone who only seems mildly intrigued. People who are selective are often seen as more desirable because having standards demonstrates self-respect and a high regard for your own time. However, holding out for the perfect person might cause you to miss out on a potentially great connection. In a room full of like-minded individuals, you should be able to identify a few people you'd consider dating. Make it your goal to leave an event having shown genuine interest, made a connection, or exchanged contact information with several people. While swiping through Tinder, take the time to thoughtfully consider each potential match instead of making quick judgments. Remember that behind every profile is a real person, and you might find a meaningful connection even if their photos don't immediately stand out to you. Treat others with the same respect and kindness you'd expect, whether interacting online or in person. If you start to feel that the person you're talking to isn't the right match, remember that they might still be interested in getting to know you. If they ask you out and you're not interested, it's more respectful to be honest rather than making excuses like \"I'm busy\" or \"I'm not ready to date right now.\" These small lies can be more hurtful than simply declining politely. Instead, smile and say, \"No thanks, but I appreciate the offer,\" then smoothly steer the conversation to a different topic. If you feel your initial interaction went well, don't hesitate to ask the person out. By then, you should have an idea of what your potential date enjoys or what activities they find fun. Suggest an activity that you both might enjoy to make the date more engaging. If your date seems hesitant about trying new restaurants or bars, propose a casual activity related to what you've discussed instead of the usual dinner date. For example, if they mentioned a love for a particular type of music, invite them to a concert you think they'd enjoy. Plan what you want to say to avoid stumbling over your words, but remain natural and authentic without rehearsing a script. Be considerate and understanding if they decline your invitation. Even if you feel disappointed, try not to take it personally. Thank them for their honesty and let them know you enjoyed meeting them."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 35.035118103027344, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -2.5358669757843018, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "When attending a sports game, concert, or bar with the intention of meeting someone, embrace boldness.

Notice what causes your dog to bark when it occurs. Here are some common reasons dogs bark: Fear or alarm can cause them to bark when they are startled or scared. Nervous dogs tend to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound, no matter where they are. Dogs may bark to protect what they perceive as their territory, which could include areas associated with you, like your house, yard, car, or even personal space. Additionally, dogs might consider frequently traveled routes as part of their territory, so if you walk your dog along the same path daily, they may view everything on that route as theirs. Many dogs will bark to seek attention, often with short and focused barks, and this behavior is more common if you respond to it, reinforcing the barking. Dogs often bark to greet people or other animals and might also bark to invite playtime. Dogs may bark due to anxiety, particularly separation anxiety, as they cannot tolerate being alone and will compulsively bark when left by themselves. Dogs may bark when they are frustrated; for instance, if your dog is tied up, unable to reach a favorite toy, or wants to play with the dog next door, they may bark to express their frustration. A dog might also bark out of boredom. Barking can communicate your dog's emotional state, and observing your dog's body language can provide clues about how they feel. For example, if your dog is afraid, it may bark while crouched down; understanding the reason behind the barking can help you calm your dog. To assist with this, here are some signs of your dog's different moods: When dogs are afraid, they try to appear smaller to seem less threatening, hunching over, tucking their tails, and flattening their ears against their heads, often yawning or licking their lips to comfort themselves. When dogs are happy, their muscles are relaxed, their mouths are loose, possibly resembling a smile, and they might pant; their ears and tail are in natural positions, and the tail may wag from side to side or in a circular motion. Dogs become alert if they sense a potential threat; their ears perk up, their gaze focuses on the object of their attention, with their tails possibly upright or over their back, usually remaining still, and the fur on their shoulders and upper back, known as hackles, may be raised. Playful dogs exhibit energetic and bouncy movements, may jump, run in circles, or bow to invite you to play, often appearing to smile. Dominant dogs display confident and assertive body language, standing tall, arching their necks, and appearing somewhat tense, with tails typically upright and stationary, often making direct eye contact. Aggressive dogs that feel confident make themselves appear larger by raising their tails, pricking their ears, and holding their heads high, often retracting their lips to show their teeth or puckering their lips forward; aggressive dogs that feel defensive combine fearful and confident body language. You can learn a lot about a bark by its sound; studies indicate that humans are quite adept at discerning the general emotion behind the tone of a dog's bark."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 29.072708129882812, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -2.152513265609741, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Dogs exhibit a wide variety of barks, each typically triggered by specific situations. Understanding the cause of your dog's barking can help address the behavior effectively. Here are some common reasons why dogs bark:\n\n1. **Fear/Alarm:** Dogs may bark when they are startled or afraid. Nervous dogs often react to unfamiliar sights or sounds, regardless of their location.\n\n2. **Territorial Protection:** Dogs instinctively protect what they perceive as their territory. This can include your home, yard, car, or even your personal space. Regularly traveled routes may also be considered part of their territory.\n\n3. **Attention Seeking:** Dogs frequently bark to capture attention. These barks are often short and focused, especially if the behavior is rewarded by your response.\n\n4. **Greeting:** Dogs bark to say hello to people or other animals and may also invite playtime through barking.\n\n5. **Anxiety:** Dogs experiencing separation anxiety can't tolerate being alone and may bark compulsively when left by themselves.\n\n6. **Frustration:** Dogs may bark when frustrated, such as when they are restrained, unable to reach a toy, or eager to play with another dog. Boredom can also lead to barking.\n\nBarking is a form of communication that reflects your dog's emotional state. By observing your dog's body language, you can gain insights into their feelings:\n\n- **Afraid:** Fearful dogs make themselves appear smaller by hunching over, tucking tails, and flattening ears. They may yawn or lick their lips for comfort.\n\n- **Happy:** Relaxed muscles, loose mouths, and a wagging tail indicate a happy dog. Panting may also be present.\n\n- **Alert:** Alert dogs perk up their ears, focus their gaze, and may have raised hackles. Their tails stand upright or over their back.\n\n- **Playful:** Playful dogs are energetic, often jumping, running in circles, or bowing to invite play. They may appear to be smiling.\n\n- **Dominant:** Confident dogs display assertive body language by standing tall, arching their necks, and appearing slightly tense.\n\n- **Aggressive:** Aggressive dogs make themselves appear larger by raising tails and pricking ears. They may show their teeth or pucker their lips.\n\nThe sound of a dog's bark can also reveal their emotions. Humans are generally good at interpreting the emotional tone of barks:\n\n- **Happy Barks:** Typically high-pitched and may include whines or growls.\n\n- **Attention-Demanding Barks:** Short and focused.\n\n- **Fear/Alarm Barks:** Lower-pitched and harsh-sounding.\n\n- **Separation Anxiety Barks:** Often shrill, sounding despairing and miserable.\n\n- **Compulsive Barks:** Monotone and repetitive, often accompanied by compulsive movements.\n\nBy understanding these cues, you can better address and manage your dog's barking behavior."}}

However, these datasets are frequently dominated by English content (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Workshop et al., 2023), resulting in an English-centric bias that can hinder the models' performance in other languages, leading to suboptimal results in non-English contexts (Ahuja et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b). Researchers have improved multilingual NLP task performance using English-centric language models by translating training or test data into English (Conneau et al., 2018; Ponti et al., 2020; Artetxe et al., 2023; Moghe et al., 2023). Recent studies have refined this approach by incorporating translation into the process of prompting LLMs for multilingual tasks (Huang et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Etxaniz et al., 2023). For instance, Shi et al. (2022) demonstrated that translating test questions into English enhances performance in multilingual reasoning tasks. Similarly, Huang et al. (2023) and Etxaniz et al. (2023) found that instructing LLMs to first translate or understand questions in English, followed by systematic problem-solving, results in improved performance. Despite these advancements, methodologies vary significantly across studies, and the influence of translation on multilingual task performance has not been thoroughly explored. Moreover, these studies primarily focus on specific NLP tasks and English-centric LLMs, with limited attention to real-world user requests in diverse languages. It is posited that English-centric LLMs generally perform better with English translations of prompts, while multilingual LLMs excel with native prompts, particularly for language-dependent tasks. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the utility of translation with LLMs across various scenarios. Initially, we compared the \"translate-test\" method, which involves translating multilingual tasks into English and optionally translating responses back into the original languages, against several baselines on multilingual NLP tasks. Subsequently, we extended the evaluation to encompass real user queries that are more likely to involve cultural and language nuances. Finally, we expanded LLM evaluations to include non-English-centric models to explore their behavioral differences from English-centric LLMs. Our findings indicate that merely translating queries into English can yield optimal results across multiple NLP task categories. For real user queries, the effects of translation depend on the languages and LLMs involved. With advanced LLMs and certain languages, employing native language prompts appears more effective. Furthermore, non-English-centric LLMs exhibit different behaviors compared to English-centric ones, with native language prompts yielding superior results by capturing cultural and linguistic nuances."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 41.31092834472656, "some": 0.9005459944407145, "bart": -0.9266089200973511, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a notable ability to understand and generate text in multiple languages, a skill largely attributed to their extensive training on diverse language corpora (OpenAI, 2023; Shi et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023).

For instance, Shi et al. (2022) demonstrate that translating test questions into English enhances performance on multilingual reasoning tasks. Similarly, Huang et al. (2023) and Etxaniz et al. (2023) show that prompting LLMs to first translate or comprehend questions in English before solving them improves outcomes.\n\nDespite these advancements, methodologies vary significantly across studies, and the impact of translation on multilingual task performance remains underexplored. Furthermore, these studies often focus on specific NLP tasks involving English-centric LLMs, with less emphasis on real-world user queries in various languages. This gap underscores the need for more nuanced research into the effectiveness of translation techniques across multilingual contexts.\n\nOur hypothesis, illustrated in Figure 1, suggests that English-centric LLMs generally perform better with English-translated prompts, whereas \"Multilingual LLMs\" excel with native prompts, particularly for tasks with high language dependency. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of translation utility in large language models across different scenarios. \n\nFirstly, we compare translating multilingual tasks into English, with an optional step of translating responses back into the original languages (i.e., the \u201ctranslate-test\u201d method), against several baselines on multilingual NLP tasks. Secondly, we extend our evaluation to real user queries, which are more likely to involve cultural and linguistic knowledge. Thirdly, we broaden the scope to include non-English-centric models to explore how their behavior differs from English-centric LLMs.\n\nOur findings indicate that simply translating queries into English can achieve optimal results in multiple NLP task categories. For real user queries, the effect of translation varies depending on the language and the LLM in use. With advanced LLMs and certain languages, using native language prompts appears more effective. Additionally, non-English-centric LLMs exhibit different behaviors from their English-centric counterparts, with native language prompts yielding superior results by capturing cultural and linguistic nuances.\n\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n- We compare various multilingual prompting strategies in NLP tasks, confirming that translation remains a robust baseline even for LLMs, and identify factors affecting performance in multilingual tasks.\n- We expand our multilingual evaluation to include real user queries and LLMs that are not primarily English-focused, addressing the limitations of previous studies.\n- Our study highlights the shortcomings of current multilingual evaluations, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive assessments that broaden the range of benchmarks and diversify the types of LLMs considered."}}

These models transform text into a high-dimensional semantic space (Mikolov et al., 2013). In neuroscience, cognitive processing signals, such as EEG and fMRI, are widely recognized for their ability to represent snapshots of language cognition in the human brain (Xu et al., 2016). These signals capture brain activity during language processing and are key to understanding the internal mechanisms of language cognition (Friederici, 2011). This raises the question: How similar are these two modalities of language representation\u2014LLM representations and cognitive language processing signals in the brain? Additionally, do LLMs mirror human cognitive language processing? Answering these questions could help interpret LLMs from a cognitive science perspective.\n\nPrevious studies have explored the consistency between representations learned by pre-trained language models and cognitive processing signals (Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Hollenstein et al., 2019a; Abnar et al., 2019). Recent research compares human neuroimaging data with representations learned by smaller, pre-trained language models, revealing that models with stronger predictive abilities for the next word exhibit greater alignment with the human brain (Schrimpf et al., 2021). However, current LLMs have increased in size by hundreds of times (e.g., LLaMa3-400B+ from Meta, 2024) and have been enhanced through alignment training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). These advancements significantly enhance LLM capabilities (Wei et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023b). However, it remains to be tested whether the latest LLMs, with scales of 7B and above, maintain consistency with human cognitive data. Furthermore, the impact of pre-training data size, alignment training, prompts, and other training strategies on LLM-brain similarity has not been thoroughly investigated.\n\nThis paper aims to assess the extent to which LLMs mirror cognitive language processing activity and to analyze the impact of different factors, such as pre-training data size, model scaling, and alignment training, on LLM-brain alignment. Specifically, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals as human cognitive language processing signals and employ representational similarity analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), a method widely used in neuroscience (Connolly et al., 2012; Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017), to compute similarity scores between LLM representations and human cognitive language processing signals. The framework for computing LLM-brain similarity is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nOur experiments involve 23 open-source LLMs, trained with various pre-training data sizes, scaling, and training strategies (i.e., pre-training, SFT, RLHF), to investigate the impact of these factors on LLM-brain similarity. We further analyze the impact of prompts on LLMs' abilities to understand human intentions and the consistency between LLM sentiment and human sentiment. Additionally, we explore the relationship between LLM evaluation capabilities and LLM-brain similarity.\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\n1. We use human cognitive language processing signals to assess the resemblance between LLMs and human cognition. By analyzing the similarity of 23 LLMs to human cognitive language processing, we investigate the impact of various factors, such as pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts, on LLM-brain similarity.\n\n2. We find that explicit prompts result in higher LLM-brain similarity compared to no prompts, indicating that explicit prompts can enhance the alignment of LLMs with human intentions.\n\n3.

We investigate: (i) whether LLMs can effectively perform Arabic NLP and speech processing tasks without prior task-specific knowledge (zero-shot); (ii) how performance varies across tasks with different complexities in zero- and few-shot settings; and (iii) how LLMs compare to current SOTA models, and whether open LLMs are as effective as commercially available (closed) models.\n\nOur investigation reveals unique insights about LLMs' performance on Arabic NLP and speech tasks:\n\nA. Zero-shot Multi-task Performer: GPT-4 outperforms other models in the majority of NLP tasks. However, a significant performance gap remains between GPT-4 and SOTA models due to the higher quality of SOTA models. For speech tasks, USM outperforms all Whisper variants and performs comparably with SOTA.\n\nB. Few-shot and SOTA: GPT-4 reduces the performance gap with SOTA in a few-shot (only 3-shots) setting. This significant performance gain is observed for almost all tasks, particularly for more complex semantic and question-answering tasks compared to syntactic and segmentation tasks. Similarly, Whisper models show promising results in speech recognition with just 2 hours of speech examples in few-shot fine-tuning. Open models (BLOOMZ and Whisper) performed poorly compared to their commercially available counterparts, but fine-tuning with more instructions may help these open models achieve closer performance to SOTA and other closed LLMs.\n\nC. MSA vs. Dialect: The performance gaps in LLMs between MSA and dialectal datasets (e.g., for machine translation (MT) and speech recognition tasks) are more pronounced, indicating the ineffectiveness of LLMs for under-represented dialects.\n\nD. Hallucination and Data Contamination: GPT models, especially GPT-3.5, suffer from the hallucination problem, where the model inserts extra information from its parametric memory. Benchmarking LLMs raises concerns about their exposure to existing datasets. In our study, we used datasets released after the cut-off date of GPT\u2019s training (September 2021). Additionally, we applied a prompt-based method with guided instructions (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023) on nine datasets using GPT-4 to determine if datasets are contaminated. Our experiments revealed that GPT-4 could not produce any examples from these datasets.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, LAraBench is the first comprehensive effort that includes commercial (closed) and open-source LLMs and evaluates zero- and few-shot settings for a wide range of Arabic NLP and speech tasks. It is the first to include the evaluation of Whisper and USM models for Arabic ASR and the first to report benchmarks for a standard Arabic TTS generative model. All resources and findings from the LAraBench study are made publicly available to scale up the effort through our LLMeBench framework (Dalvi et al., 2024)."}}

If you want to find Monarch caterpillars, you can plant milkweed in your yard or explore overgrown land in your area; identify milkweed by its broad leaves, milky sap, and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are often pink, orange, or deep pink. The exact appearance of milkweed varies with each variety, but they typically have a stalk with broad leaves; common varieties include common milkweed with pink flowers, swamp milkweed with deep pink blooms, and butterfly weed with bright orange flowers, each attracting different pollinators. It\u2019s easy to identify milkweed if it\u2019s flowering, as the flowers have a distinctive star shape; common milkweed flowers are pink, butterfly weed boasts bright orange blooms, and swamp milkweed showcases deep pink flowers, all providing nectar for a variety of insects. If the stalk or leaves are damaged, milkweed secretes a milky fluid, which not only gives the plant its name but also contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores and aids in identification due to its sticky texture. Milkweed grows in areas where the ground has been disturbed, such as fields, roadsides, construction sites, vacant lots, and along power lines, thriving in these open and sunny environments. For example, you might find it growing along a roadside, bike path, or railroad tracks, or spot some in a pasture, park, or overgrown garden; these areas often have disturbed soil, ample sunlight, and good drainage, which are ideal conditions for milkweed growth. Before you head out to look for milkweed plants, do an online search for pictures of the plant or check a plant identification guide to familiarize yourself with their characteristics, such as their unique leaf shape and flower color. Once you\u2019ve located a milkweed plant, check it every day starting in the spring when the plants are most active, growing rapidly as temperatures warm, particularly in April and May. Monarch eggs are yellow, round, and about the size of a pinhead, usually found on the underside of the leaf; they are smooth and slightly ribbed, resembling tiny pearls, and measure just over 1 mm in diameter. There is typically only one egg on a leaf, and often a female monarch will only lay one egg on each milkweed plant, ensuring that her offspring have enough resources and reducing competition among larvae by spacing out the eggs. Monarch eggs hatch within 4 or 5 days, so spotting the eggs early is crucial for monitoring their development and protecting them from predators, as this initial stage is critical for survival, requiring careful observation. If you haven\u2019t checked the plant for a few days, you may spot Monarch caterpillars instead of their eggs, as they quickly grow after hatching, entering the larval stage of their life cycle where they molt several times. Newly-hatched caterpillars are about the size of a grain of rice, with smooth bodies and faint black, yellow, and white stripes, which become more pronounced as they mature through successive molts, helping them blend into the milkweed leaves. Older caterpillars have the same distinct stripes but are larger, growing up to 1\u20131\u00bd in (2.5\u20133.8 cm) before they transform into a butterfly, undergoing several molts and eventually forming a chrysalis where metamorphosis occurs. To protect the fragile Monarch eggs or newly-hatched larvae, it\u2019s best to leave them on the leaf to ensure they continue receiving nutrients and protection from the plant's toxins that deter predators, which are crucial for their survival. Either snap the milkweed stalk with your hands or gently pluck off the leaf containing the egg, then carry it back to your home, being careful not to damage the egg while holding the leaf securely to ensure the caterpillar's future food supply remains intact. Taking the whole stalk provides plenty of food for your hungry caterpillar, but you can also gather a few leaves if you prefer to manage the plant more sustainably, ensuring the caterpillars receive a balanced diet rich in cardenolides. Remember to check the whole plant to ensure it\u2019s not hiding any other insects or their eggs, which could pose a threat to the caterpillars or disrupt their habitat by competing for resources, leading to potential harm. If you see anything that's not a monarch caterpillar or egg, either brush away the insect or remove the leaf that does not contain the egg to prevent harmful interactions and maintain a safe environment for the caterpillars. To keep the milkweed stalk fresh, wrap the end in wet paper towels, then in aluminum foil to maintain moisture and prevent wilting, ensuring the leaves stay viable for the caterpillars. You could also use foam floral tubes if you have access to florist supplies, as they maintain moisture and provide stability for the stalk, keeping it fresh longer and easier to manage. Once you get the milkweed inside, sprinkle a few drops of water onto a paper towel, then place it at the bottom of a small container, like a glass jar or a food storage container, to create a humid environment that mimics natural conditions and prevents the leaves from drying out. If you brought the entire stalk of milkweed, carefully snip off the leaf with the egg, then place the leaf egg-side-up into the container to ensure the egg remains undisturbed and in a stable position for optimal hatching conditions. Cover the container with a lid made of mesh or one that has holes to allow air to circulate, preventing mold and providing ventilation, which is essential for maintaining a healthy environment for the developing larvae. The water on the paper towel will keep the milkweed leaf from drying out, maintaining the necessary humidity for the egg or caterpillar, which is critical for their development and survival, ensuring they have a constant food source. If you found caterpillars that have already hatched, you can move them directly to their permanent enclosure, where they can continue their development with ample space and resources, fostering a healthy growth environment. When the larvae emerge from their eggs, they'll get their food and water intake by eating the milkweed leaves they were attached to, deriving essential nutrients like cardenolides from the plant, which are vital for their growth and defense against predators. Add a few drops of water each day to keep the milkweed from drying out while you wait for the eggs to hatch, ensuring the leaves remain fresh and full of nutrients necessary for the caterpillars' survival and growth. Keep doing this until the eggs hatch, which typically takes about 4 days, allowing you to observe the transformation process closely and monitor the health of the developing larvae as they transition to the next stage. You can safely wait to move the larvae until they\u2019re about 4 or 5 days old, as they won\u2019t crawl until then and are less likely to be injured, giving you time to prepare their new habitat with fresh leaves. Once they are 4 or 5 days old, they should be about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and ready to go to their main enclosure, where they have more space to grow and access to fresh leaves for continued nourishment. If a caterpillar is crawling on a leaf, you can pick up the whole leaf and move it to a new enclosure, minimizing stress on the caterpillar by keeping it on a familiar food source, ensuring it feels secure. If it is on the bottom or side of the container, gently pick it up with your fingers to move it, taking care to support its body and avoid causing harm, ensuring the caterpillar's safety. By hatching the eggs in a small container, you can keep a close eye on their progress, ensuring a controlled environment for their development and reducing the risk of predation and disease transmission. Additionally, if you\u2019re raising multiple generations of caterpillars, having a separate container for hatching the eggs will help prevent the spread of illness. You\u2019ll only be moving healthy caterpillars to the larger enclosure, thereby maintaining a healthy population and reducing competition for resources."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 22.476116180419922, "some": 0.8951439062754313, "bart": -1.4563753604888916, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Monarch caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed plants, and female butterflies lay their eggs on these plants to ensure their larvae have ample food.

However, meaningful change cannot be implemented overnight. Overcoming a single bad habit can be challenging, so taking small steps is perfectly okay \u2013 and even expected. The first step towards meaningful change is acknowledging your areas of concern. Being honest with yourself and identifying your habits is essential. This self-awareness is crucial for overcoming your problems and achieving meaningful change. To boost your confidence in your self-improvement project, start by tackling small, manageable tasks. Focus on one area of improvement at a time. Make significant progress in this area before moving on to the next challenge or goal. You may notice that positive changes in one area of your life can have a ripple effect. These changes can happen without you even realizing it. To overcome your current challenges, examine the underlying factors that are hindering your progress. Admitting that we're our own obstacles to happiness can be a tough pill to swallow, but recognizing this truth empowers us because we are the only ones who can make changes to improve our lives. Reflect on the habits that consistently leave you feeling unfulfilled or unhappy. Individuals struggling with chronic unhappiness often exhibit similar patterns of behavior. Some common habits that can contribute to chronic unhappiness include playing the victim, using addictive behaviors to cope, feeling powerless, neglecting health, and having rocky relationships. Negative thoughts are a normal part of life, but if your life is consistently unfulfilling, your thought patterns may be a contributing factor. The constant stream of negative thoughts can be debilitating, leaving you feeling powerless to make positive changes. Here are eight common thought patterns that can contribute to chronic unhappiness and hold you back. Do you identify with any of these patterns? Self-defeating talk includes phrases like 'I can't' or 'I'm not good enough.' Negative ruminations involve dwelling on past traumas or stressful events. Assuming the worst involves always expecting the negative outcome, which can lead to a pessimistic outlook on life. Comparing yourself unfavorably to others can be a major source of unhappiness. Playing the victim involves blaming circumstances or others for your problems, which is another common pattern of behavior. Difficulty forgiving yourself can lead to prolonged feelings of guilt and shame. Fear of failure or making mistakes can lead to unrealistic expectations, which can result in perfectionism. If your current life circumstances are unsatisfying, it may be time to evaluate your social network. Surround yourself with individuals who uplift and support you. Healthy, supportive relationships are vital for overall well-being. If your relationships are consistently draining or demotivating, it may be time to reassess them. As an adult, it's essential to recognize your role in toxic relationships and take responsibility. You have the power to break free from toxic relationships, as choosing to stay in them can compromise your own happiness and well-being."}, "gpt_4o": {"score": {"ppl": 27.39056968688965, "some": 0.8976849714914957, "bart": -2.1216330528259277, "cons_acc": 1, "cons_fb": "Constraints following feedback:\n"}, "polished_text": "Revamping your entire life can feel like a daunting task.

It can be difficult to admit that we are often our own obstacles to happiness. However, recognizing this empowers you, as you are the only one who can enact changes to enhance your life. Reflect on behaviors that lead to dissatisfaction. Chronically unhappy individuals often share similar habits, such as playing the victim, using substances or activities to cope, feeling powerless to change their emotional state, neglecting health, and having unstable relationships.\n\nNegative thoughts are a normal part of life, but if you constantly feel let down by life, your mindset might be the culprit. The thoughts that replay in your mind can greatly impact your sense of control and ability to improve your life. Consider whether you are guilty of any of these eight negative thought patterns common among chronically unhappy people:\n\n1. Self-defeating talk: Phrases like \"I can't...\" or \"I'm not good enough...\"\n2. Ruminating on the past: Dwelling on past negative or stressful events.\n3. Assuming the worst: Expecting negative outcomes or viewing life with a \"glass half empty\" perspective.\n4. Critically comparing yourself to others: Seeing others as more attractive, wealthier, or more successful.\n5. Playing the victim: Viewing yourself as weak or unable to handle challenges.\n6. Struggling to forgive yourself: Lingering on guilt over past mistakes.\n7. Blaming: Holding others responsible for your misfortunes.\n8. Fearing failure or mistakes: Setting unrealistically high standards and being overly perfectionistic.\n\nIf you're dissatisfied with your life, it might be time to evaluate your social circle. Ideally, you should surround yourself with positive, uplifting people who appreciate your worth. Such relationships are vital to happiness. However, if your relationships drain you, demotivate you, or contribute to unhealthy habits, they may need to be reassessed. As an adult, you must take responsibility for your role in any toxic relationships. Despite what you may believe, you have the power to break free. If you choose to stay in such relationships, acknowledge that you are doing so at the expense of your well-being."}}

For instance, LLMs have shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks (Dong et al., 2023). Although widely adopted, LLMs face a significant challenge: they can produce hallucinations in certain situations (Ye et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023). They generate information that sounds plausible but is not factual, which limits their real-world applicability. To mitigate hallucinations, researchers have grounded LLM-generated responses in supported evidence, either by providing rationales or adding citations (Li et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). Additionally, recent studies have used external knowledge sources, such as retrieved documents and knowledge graphs, for attribution (Shuster et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023c). Generally, these approaches are categorized into two types: 1) the model generates an answer with citations based on retrieved documents (Li et al., 2023b), and 2) an answer is first generated, then modified to add attribution references by retrieving with the query and initial answer (Gao et al., 2023a). However, these works focus mainly on the retrieval stage (Ye et al., 2023b) and the evaluation process (Yue et al., 2023), indicating a gap in optimizing the generation process. Therefore, given the model's extensive knowledge and capabilities, reducing hallucinations in both the original answer and the attribution process is crucial. Fine-tuning LLMs after pre-training can significantly enhance performance for users' downstream tasks. Initially, supervised fine-tuning can be done using standard likelihood-based training with positive examples of correct behavior. Furthermore, given both positive and negative examples (binary or pairwise feedback), methods like unlikelihood training on negative examples (Welleck et al., 2020) or RLHF-PPO (Ziegler et al., 2019) can be employed. Nonetheless, these methods often struggle with costly data collection processes, reward model training, sparse rewards, and text degeneration issues, which complicate their practical application (Azar et al., 2023). In this paper, we tackle these challenges by conceptualizing the attribution task for LLMs as preference learning, drawing inspiration from citation mechanisms in human scholarly writing (Brooks, 1986; Teplitskiy et al., 2022), and introducing an Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework, as illustrated in Figure 1. We begin by compiling a curated dataset of 6,330 examples, sourced and refined from existing datasets for post-training purposes. Given the high cost and time-intensive nature of preference pair annotations, we introduce an automated method to generate attribution preference data, resulting in 95,263 pairs. Additionally, drawing inspiration from human citation processes and direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023), we propose a progressive preference optimization method with experience replay, bypassing the need for explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5.

Generative AI covers a wide range of applications, with large language models (LLMs) being among the most notable. The GPT series exemplifies the capabilities and significant advancements of large-scale language models. Scholars have observed that as the parameter count of GPT language models increases, their natural language understanding capabilities become more powerful. Specifically, GPT-3 has 170 billion parameters. Moreover, this enhanced natural language understanding holds great promise for both business and society, offering substantial potential across various domains. However, the limitations of natural language understanding present a significant challenge in the field of question-answering (QA) systems. QA systems operate in open-world scenarios, often resulting in mismatched questions and answers due to linguistic diversity. As a result, the open-world nature of QA systems means that the training set cannot cover all possible user question inputs. Users often phrase questions in diverse ways, which, combined with linguistic diversity, leads to an unseen class problem, causing mismatches and reducing QA accuracy. The negative impact of unseen classes can be particularly problematic in Knowledge-based Question and Answer (KBQA) tasks with a fixed knowledge base, as mismatches can lower accuracy and even lead to task failure. Open-domain Knowledge-based Question and Answer (KBQA) systems have emerged to address these challenges due to the rapid growth of large-scale knowledge bases. In a KBQA system, the goal is to comprehend natural language questions and provide answers based on external knowledge. Recently, KBQA has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry due to its ability to deliver accurate answers across a wide range of domains, enabled by open-source knowledge bases. For instance, Google's integration of the Knowledge Vault (KV) knowledge graph into its search engine has significantly enhanced the user experience. The core idea of KBQA is to map natural language questions to answers found in a knowledge base. In a KBQA system, the first step is to comprehend the question at the semantic level, typically mapping it to the user's intent.

This growth is a testament to technological advancement and the increasing reliance of businesses and organizations on digital platforms for various operations. A central aspect of this digital proliferation is the extensive use of technologies for personal data collection, primarily aimed at enhancing targeted marketing strategies. The capacity to collect, analyze, and utilize user data has become a cornerstone of modern commerce, providing businesses with crucial consumer insights. However, the increasing collection and use of personal data has raised significant concerns about privacy violations. Users face threats to their privacy as their data becomes a highly sought-after commodity in the digital marketplace. This concern has spurred the development of comprehensive regulatory frameworks and data protection laws aimed at safeguarding user privacy. These frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, impose stringent guidelines on data management practices. Ensuring compliance with these frameworks, however, presents a daunting challenge. The rapid expansion of online services, compounded by globalization, makes it impractical, if not impossible, for regulators to manually assess each service's adherence to privacy laws. This issue is further complicated by the dynamic nature of online services, where data processing practices and the privacy policies that disclose them frequently change. In response to these challenges, automated methods have been proposed for analyzing privacy policies at scale. This approach holds significant potential for advancing research aimed at understanding and highlighting privacy concerns while offering regulators a practical tool for conducting mass evaluations of applications and services, thereby enhancing compliance with privacy regulations. Automated analysis of privacy policies employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Cutting-edge NLP techniques, both symbolic and statistical, are proposed for this task, although each presents specific limitations. Symbolic approaches rely on predefined rules, resulting in lower performance compared to statistical approaches due to their lack of adaptability to the nuances of legal texts. Consequently, state-of-the-art research has predominantly relied on statistical methods like machine learning techniques, particularly supervised learning models, to train and evaluate models that identify privacy practice disclosures, such as personal data collection or sharing. These models depend on manually annotated datasets, which are costly, time-consuming to create, and susceptible to errors. Furthermore, building and training these models require specialized technical expertise, contributing to a higher barrier to entry. As a result, their practical application is mainly feasible for large-scale projects where the benefits justify these significant costs.

In this context, this paper proposes using LLMs for the efficient extraction of privacy practices from privacy policies. Specifically, we focus on ChatGPT, which leverages advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. Our study identifies the most effective ChatGPT configurations, integrating techniques such as few-shot learning. Additionally, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis between our proposed ChatGPT configuration and Llama 2, along with other cutting-edge techniques. Our findings indicate that our proposal rivals and even surpasses these traditional methods. Moreover, we discuss its benefits, including lower upfront costs, reduced processing times, and enhanced user-friendliness. Thus, we propose LLM-based solutions, specifically our ChatGPT configuration, as a viable alternative to traditional NLP techniques in automated privacy policy processing.

As a result, their practical application is mainly suitable for large-scale projects where the benefits can outweigh these significant costs.\n\nOn the other hand, modern Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a significant advancement in the NLP domain. These models can understand and generate human-like text, making them particularly well-suited for parsing and analyzing the complex language present in privacy policies without the need for annotated datasets. In this context, this paper proposes the application of LLMs for the effective and efficient extraction of privacy practices from privacy policies. Specifically, we focus on ChatGPT, which utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. Our study identifies the optimal configuration of ChatGPT prompts, parameters, and models, incorporating advanced techniques such as few-shot learning. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our proposed ChatGPT configuration with Llama 2 and other state-of-the-art techniques. Our findings demonstrate that our proposal competes with and even outperforms these traditional methods. Moreover, we discuss its advantages in terms of lower upfront costs, reduced processing times, and greater ease of use. Therefore, we propose LLM-based solutions and our specific ChatGPT configuration as a viable alternative to traditional NLP techniques for automated privacy policy processing. Our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the application of GenAI in legal and regulatory contexts, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more efficient, cost-effective, and accessible tools for privacy policy analysis."}}

Many of these algorithms are designed to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. If the overall performance of these algorithms is considered satisfactory, the learned relationships are often assumed to be accurate and are applied in real-world scenarios, although verifying their accuracy across different contexts can be difficult. Quantifying this can be challenging because assessing confidence in a specific relationship across various inputs is complex. These shortcomings lead to numerous AI safety and social bias issues, including significant failures in autopilot systems, where the lack of accurate confidence assessments can result in critical errors, highlighting the need for improved evaluation metrics. We need systems capable of learning precise relationships and better quantifying the confidence levels or uncertainties of their predictions. By accessing information about uncertainty, many of the issues identified can be more effectively addressed, ensuring more reliable outcomes. Uncertainties often occur when applying machine learning models. For instance, we may be unsure whether the chosen structure and model parameters can adequately capture the data distribution. This issue, known as model uncertainty or epistemic uncertainty, relates to the limitations of the model's understanding of the data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), as discussed by Buntine and Weigend (1991), Denker and Lecun (1991), MacKay (1992, 1995), and Neal (2012), provide a method for quantifying uncertainty related to model parameters by representing all model weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. In this context, it is crucial that the learned relationships of a BNN model remain consistent across different weight samples. By sampling weights and processing inputs through the network multiple times, we can effectively quantify model uncertainties with BNNs. Using a BNN to quantify model uncertainty can enhance representations and predictions due to its ensemble effect. This method, as demonstrated by Blundell et al. (2015), is also beneficial for exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) challenges, such as contextual bandits. Another situation where uncertainty arises is when the data collected is noisy. This typically happens when data is obtained through observations and measurements. Even with accurate observations and measurements, noise can still manifest in the data generation process. These uncertainties, known as data uncertainties or aleatoric uncertainty (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen 2009), include variations inherent in the data itself. Depending on the nature of the uncertainty, data uncertainty is further categorized into homoscedastic uncertainty and heteroscedastic uncertainty. Homoscedastic uncertainty is consistent across the input space and may result from systematic observation noise. In contrast, heteroscedastic uncertainty varies with the input. For example, when predicting the sentiment of a Yelp review, a single-word review like \"good\" might be rated 3, 4, or 5 stars, whereas a detailed review with strong positive language is likely to be rated 5 stars. Throughout this paper, we also refer to this type of uncertainty as input-dependent data uncertainty. Recently, there has been a surge of research focused on the effects of quantifying uncertainties in various applications, as noted by Kendall, Badrinarayanan, and Cipolla (2015); Gal and Ghahramani (2016b); Kendall and Gal (2017); Zhu and Laptev (2017). In this paper, we investigate the benefits of quantifying both model and data uncertainties in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of quantifying model uncertainty and input-dependent data uncertainty in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling. We demonstrate a significant improvement in performance when both uncertainties are integrated into the model. Additionally, we analyze the characteristics of the quantified uncertainties.

The process of geospatially grounded language understanding involves recognizing geospatial concepts, inferring their identities, and reasoning about their spatial relations. These tasks are essential for applications involving the use of place names and their spatial relations, such as social media message analysis, emergency response, natural disaster analysis, and geographic information retrieval (Hu et al., 2022; Gritta et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2020; Wallgr\u00fcn et al., 2018).

Geo-corpora should cover worldwide geo-entity names, their variations, geographical locations, and their spatial relations to other geo-entities. Although some geo-corpora are available, such as LGL and SpatialML, these datasets are relatively small (Lieberman et al., 2010; Mani et al., 2010). In contrast, Wikipedia stores many articles describing places worldwide, making it a comprehensive resource for geospatially grounded language understanding. However, training with Wikipedia only partially addresses the challenges in geospatial grounding, as it primarily provides the linguistic context of a geo-entity, including information on history, demographics, climate, etc. Additionally, information about the geospatial neighbors of a geo-entity is still missing.

Additionally, the geolocations from OpenStreetMap can connect the learned geo-entity representations to actual physical locations on Earth.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce GEOLM, a language model specifically designed to enhance geospatially grounded natural language understanding. Our model aims to improve the comprehension of places, types, and spatial relationships in natural language. We utilize Wikipedia, Wikidata, and OpenStreetMap to create geospatially grounded training samples, using geo-entity names as anchors. GEOLM translates Wikidata relations into natural language and aligns the linguistic context from Wikipedia and Wikidata with the geospatial context from OpenStreetMap. Since existing language models do not process geocoordinates as input, GEOLM incorporates a spatial coordinate embedding module to learn the distances and directional relationships between geo-entities. During inference, our model can accept either natural language or geographical subregions (i.e., a set of nearby geo-entities) as input and make inferences based on the aligned linguistic-geospatial information.\n\nWe employ two training strategies: contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018) between natural language corpus and linearized geographic data, and masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2019) by integrating these two modalities. We view GEOLM as a versatile model capable of addressing various geographically related language understanding tasks, such as toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geospatial relation extraction."}}
